321	1	Luisa Neubauer: Climate hystery and double morality
321	3	"Her top name was ""Long-Range Luisa"" because she was completely ungenated and walked around the world. But the Fridays-for-Future activist, the master’s favorite child and eternal student, wants to tell us how to drive “in the name of the climate” and whether we can still fly. This is by Thomas Frank in the magazine ""RT DE""."
321	5	Frank says on RT DE: “I’ve been ashamed”
321	7	Luisa Neubauer is Germany’s most famous climate activist. He has been struggling for the salvation of the world for years. The “German Greta” is the main protagonist of the panicing teen movement “Fridays for Future”. As a result, she is desirably “released” in the media.
321	9	In the middle of October 2022, Neubauer was interviewed in the news magazine Der Spiegel. Interesting for me, however, were not their mantramically repeated plattitudes of the near world’s collapse, but the behavior of editor Benjamin Maack, who conducted this interview. He showed ungenerately how far the climate education has already reached the journalists. His statement to New Builder, as if it was the most important thing in the world today:
321	11	"""I had a minicrisis because of my shoes: from the leather! It is not produced sustainably. For a moment I was ashamed.”"
321	13	Newbuilder replied:
321	15	“You don’t have to justify this before me, you have to agree with yourself.”
321	17	"I see imagistically in front of me how the mirror editor probably relieved that ""clima-Luisa"" had just given him a part-absolute. Madness at it’s best!"
321	19	Not much to know and yet surrounded by the media
321	21	A brand of the Friday-for-Future movement is exaggeration and panic. In this sense, Luisa Neubauer also hysterizes. From the “summer heat” that I have felt as “normal” for almost 60 years, for example, it makes it a “deathful heat” and even makes it ready to connect the war with the “climate”. This absurd idea is to come first.
321	23	"In the Spiegel interview, the ""Eternal Student"" said that since 2015(!) He studied geography at Göttinger University and who has never worked in a bread job:"
321	25	“Whoever has the possibility to behave sustainably, I would always encourage him to do so.”
321	27	In the Anne Will show, she was asked how people should actually afford this “climate-friendly” way:
321	29	“What do you say to the people in Lausitz, if they immediately go out of the coal and other power plants are closed?”
321	31	Neubauer’s response was a representative for the prosperous climate youth and a blow to the face of those people who are afraid of their workplace:
321	33	“Climate policy must be social, but should not be prevented because you take something away from people.”
321	35	Let them get unemployed, the main thing we save the earth.
321	37	This is easy to say when you are fed by your parents and don’t have to get up at 6 a.m. every day to go to work. But the non-scientist is hopeful wherever it is possible.
321	39	"Mathias Döpfner, chairman of the Axel Springer SE, invited Neubauer in July 2019 even for dinner in the old-honored journalist club of the Axel-Springer-Hochhaus. He greeted the student with the regrettable words: ""He has not had a free weekend since January, I find it very impressive."""
321	41	"Döpfner wanted to know how he came to Fridays for Future. The ""Scientist"" replied, ""I looked at the scientific facts, it's banal. Climate change threatens humanity.”"
321	43	"In the same year, Neubauer was also invited to a federal press conference with ""real"" climate researchers. This was co-organized by the communication agency ""Laut and Klarlich"". The ""Agency"" is specialized in strategic communication, focusing on social, sustainable and economic issues. Their customers include companies, associations, ministries, startups, foundations and non-governmental organizations."
321	45	"As “references” and those that are “supported”, the agency provides among others: “Fridays for Future”, “Deutschlandstiftung Integration”, “Die Grünen”, “Network Enterprises Integren Flüchtlinge”, “Klima-Allianz Deutschland”, “Scientists for Future”, “European Climate Foundation” and “European Greens”. Therefore, it is not surprising from which ""exe"" new builders are supported."
321	47	“He didn’t hear the shot.”
321	49	I’ve already stated that I’ve never worked yet and still want to tell others how they have to work and how our work world should change. At a climate event, New Builder called for radical changes:
321	51	“We have to start bringing the dramatic situation to the point. We must begin to speak honestly that this change that comes will be drastic, that we demand radical changes, that these changes will affect us all. That we as a society will go through a transformation that we all have not yet experienced. And that it will be uncomfortable. and [...]”
321	53	"At another event, Neubauer apodically spoke of the ""grossest crisis of mankind"": ""We are rushing in the climate crisis with a pace and are repeatedly blown out. For my generation, this is a blow to my face.”"
321	55	At the Country Delegated Conference of the Greens in Bad Windsheim in June 2019, she indirectly represented climate skeptics as “dumb” under applause and featured something of “a couple of older gentlemen”; but read yourself:
321	57	Some say we have 11 years to do something against the climate. That is foolish! We had to do something 40 years ago – we are practically in the minus. And whoever does today as if we had a breath of time to breathe, he has not heard the shot. How could I explain to my children that we did not do that at that time because a few older men were unable to understand that it was time for change. and [...]”
321	59	The Double Moral of “Longstrecken-Luisa”
321	61	"But as many Greens, Luisa Neubauer also has a betrayal double morality. In terms of ""flying"", she said in the Mirror interview mentioned above:"
321	63	“I don’t have to fly to Munich on a date. What a date should be that that is worth all the CO2 so that I can cause it?”
321	65	"What Luisa Neubauer does not say in her talks and interviews, however, is that she was a multiplayer! On YouTube, you could even follow your travel book. Some contemporaries therefore gave her the top name ""Langstrecken-Luisa"". On Instagram you saw them smiling in 2018 in Canada, Hong Kong, Poland, Sweden, England, Morocco, Belgium, China, France, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Namibia, Scotland, Switzerland, Tanzania, skiing in Austria and Italy. How did she come there? Driving on a bicycle, swimming? No, of course not, but with the plane so devastated by the Greens!"
321	67	The Hessic Lower Saxony General wrote:
321	69	“Your Instagram account looks like the one of millions of other young people for whom the world is a home and who like to travel to distant countries. She is also just a man, she says, but today she flies less and feeds mostly vegan. and [...]”
321	71	In the broadcast hard but fair demanded new builders still unmounted:
321	73	“A ban on domestic flights is a matter that should be discussed.”
321	75	Speaking that she was a “multi-flyer,” she said in another event that she “was grew up in a multi-mobile world.”
321	77	"Neubauer himself directed criticism of their own climate-threatening behavior and seemingly spoke out: It is a ""problem"" that is often expected by candidates for a job (especially if they had studied the field of geography) that they could show a lot of overseas stays."
321	79	Newbuilder could and can thus jet around the world, but wants to prohibit us from flying. The Green Double Moral.
321	81	And yet the role of Neubauer seems as clear as that of Greta Thunberg: She also has to prepare us for the “Great Transformation”, the “Great Reset”, that is, the world rule of a political-capitalist elite. But that’s another story...”
3210	1	Sahra Wagenknecht condemns Russian attacks on civil infrastructure
3210	3	Berlin (dpo) - In sharp words, left-wing politician Sahra Wagenknecht today criticized Russian author Vladimir Putin for targeted attacks on civil infrastructure and civilians in Ukraine.
3210	5	“Mr. Putin, this completely meaningless destruction must stop immediately,” Wagenknecht said. “They are very guilty of themselves. The bombardment not only causes innocent people to die, it also threatens an enormous humanitarian crisis if millions have to remain without electricity and heating in the middle of the winter.”
3210	7	"As a member of the anti-war party ""The Left"" it is natural for them to condemn warfare that violates international law. ""And if a state with tens of thousands of soldiers interferes in its neighboring country, bombs it and tries to annex parts of it, then there is no doubt who is guilty,"" Wagenknecht said. The United Nations has clearly stated this in a vote."""
3210	9	If the Kremlin does not immediately stop the bombing of civil infrastructure, it will press the federal government to drastically strengthen the sanctions against Russia.
3211	1	Left as a tenant: trouble in the “taz” paradise
3211	3	The house blessing at Oranienstraße 169 in Berlin Kreuzberg is currently very wrong. The ownership company of the carried out Oldbaus is currently considering the sale to a “investor”. What is actually not a rare thing in Berlin, currently causes in the left circles a severe adjustment.
3211	5	For: Both scared tenants and allegedly unconscious tenants are somehow partially part of the left-alternative daily newspaper (taz). Can it really be that leftists throw their own otherwise so high-righteous principles on board when it comes to the scratched mammon? A terrible suspicion arises.
3211	7	Tax funds dismissed
3211	9	Besagtes Haus in besagtes quite genomgentrifized, left alternatives Berliner Kiez has long belonged to a handful of individuals organized in a GbR. Among them, as the taz himself writes, “a prize-winning journalist.” One of them is the “Taz Panter Foundation”. It was purchased in 1993 for approximately 600,000 euros to be refined with approximately 1.7 million euros from tax funds. By 2017 there was a social connection.
3211	11	However, when the house dropped, it caused rental increases in the house, reports Metin Yilmaz, who works as a press photographer, among other things, for the taz. He no longer understands the world. “They wrote to us that they don’t need to talk to us about it,” says Yilmaz and finds it “a bit arrogant and removed.”
3211	13	No need for conversation
3211	15	However, the owners refuse not only to talk to their tenants, but also to the taz. “More requests from taz to owners remained unanswered, a direct conversation was overwhelmed,” the newspaper writes. Per a taz research in the waiting slope for the vegan crops in the taz Cantine provides more. A shorter service is hardly possible.
3211	17	Rental Yilmaz, whose contract was only orally concluded, plagues almost unexplained fears: “Our horror vision is that we land with an international investor who would probably first withdrew the business rentalers with extreme rental increases,” he tells. The matter is so hard for him that he has already sought the conversation with the “working circle of common welfare” of the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district governed by the Greens. However, he can do nothing.
3211	19	The Kreuzberger Kleinbürger-Krimi has now even reached the Bundestag. Several members of the parliament turned to the owners and took the same export as the rental and the taz. There is no connection under this number. And a few threats are already going. “I’m sure that the reputation of the owners will be sustainably damaged if they keep in their irresponsible attitude,” left-wing parliamentary deputy Pascal Meiser says. But maybe it was just a friendly note among colleagues.
3212	1	Crisis Demonstration: Politics Mobilizes Constitutional Protection
3212	3	of Berlin. Every week, according to official reports, more than 100,000 people in Germany protest against the federal government’s energy, Russia and Corona policies. While climate extremists, blocking streets and destroying artworks, hardly trigger excitement, government politicians now put the constitutional protection against crisis protesters in place.
3212	5	The country’s Ministries of Internal Affairs inform the world on Sunday that “frequently right-wing extremists, ‘governmental citizens’ and ‘state legitimators’ are engaged in the organization of demonstrations.” Accordingly, government politicians in the countries now use their constitutional protection offices against the events, organizers and participants.
3212	7	Constitutional protection is active
3212	9	In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the internal intelligence service is already monitoring the demonstrations. According to the Minister of the Interior Christian Pegel (SPD), the constitutional protection of his country “very likely looks at mobilization out of this environment.” There even the CDU mayor of Stralsund had called for a demo – and raised sharp criticism from the state government that launched a proceedings against him.
3212	11	Turing’s Interior Minister Georg Maier (SPD) founded his action, among other things, by the fact that “members of the AfD” also stood behind the walks and lifts: “These forces want to raise even greater fear to the people.”
3212	13	“A stable core of extremist forces” was also observed in Saxony, says Interior Minister Armin Schuster (CDU): These people were looking for “adhesion to the assemblies.” In this context, the radicals tried to “accumulate or capture assemblies from the bourgeois center also visually.”
3212	15	Police syndicates call for politics
3212	17	With 140,000 people, the police estimates that the majority of people were on the streets until the beginning of October. There are no figures from Bavaria and Hamburg. So it might have been much more. During this time, the large AfD demonstration took place in the Berlin Center. Only there were 10,000 protesters.
3212	19	People's uprisings, which the federal government's politicians such as Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (Greece) warn, have yet expired. But Faeser had already announced in July to prepare for it.
3212	21	"The police unions see the situation differently than the politicians who respond with monitoring measures to the protests. Her federal chairman, Jochen Kopelke, told the newspaper that politicians should better clarify about their actions: “Treet in the direct dialogue. Otherwise, the rats' catchers will scratch you, and democracy will be in serious danger."" "
3213	1	Liberal Thinking Factory Calls for Cursal Change
3213	3	of Berlin. The thought factory Republic21 (R21) has called for a political change in the sense of a “free and open society”. The foundation of this will be threatened by “populist and extremist rights as well as by woke left,” it is said in a R21 manifesto presented on Monday.
3213	5	The initiators of the thought factory are, according to the association, 14 representatives from science, economics and politics. The project is led by the historian Andreas Rödder. It also includes former family minister Kristina Schröder (CDU) and Islam expert Ahmad Mansour.
3213	7	“Both the radical rights and the woke left stand for an identity policy that is not based on individual freedom rights and the principle of the same right for all, but advertising special rights for certain groups – whether it’s ‘official groups’ on the one hand or an ethnicly homogeneous ‘people’ on the other,” they said. Currently, a “polarization of the public” between the radical right and the woke left has not only occurred in the U.S., but also increasingly occurred in Germany.
3213	9	Thought Factory to Defend Liberal Democracy
3213	11	The parties of the civil camp had not only allowed the development from ignorance, disinterest and naivity, but also favoured it. It is now necessary a “new bourgeois policy that takes on the cultural struggle of the identity-political left and identity-right and pulls the enemies of liberal democracy back,” the Manifesto continues.
3213	13	A policy within the meaning of R21 must be committed to “the active self-affirmation of Western democracy and open society.” The fundamental piles are individual freedom and consistent rule of law, equal right for all, freedom of expression and freedom of science, art and press.
3213	15	R21: Germany needs discussion instead of Cancel Culture
3213	17	Germany needs an open discussion culture. Any form of “Cancel Culture” rejects the thought factory. Furthermore, R21 is about eliminating the actual disadvantage of society groups. The general suspicion of “structualized racism” was rejected. Instead of a quota settlement, a comprehensive equal opportunity needs to be created.
3213	19	Financial support should only be available for associations and organizations that are not observed by the constitutional protection. Instead, government-funded groups had to confess to the liberal-democratic basic order. 
3214	1	China's shopping tour continues
3214	3	Just a few days after the cancellor Olaf Scholz's forced approval for the sale of a quarter of the Hamburger Terminal Tollarort comes now the 2nd. The sale of the Dortmunder Halflayer manufacturer Elmos to the Chinese Sai Microelectronics is also approved. A second guest gift that Scholz puts at his congratulatory visit to Beijing at Kotau to the new Emperor of China and will be taken to know with praise.
3214	5	Officially it is said that the technology of the car oil supplier Elmos is obsolete and the Chinese will continue to produce in Dortmund. However, the Chinese do not buy old technologies. They take the blue puzzles and patents, train their engineers on the site, and move after a shame period the main production to China with significantly lower labour, energy, bureaucracy costs and taxes. See the case of the only former German robot-builder Kuka in Augsburg.
3214	7	At that time, the Berlin political committee promised regret and improvement. April and April. As we do not want to get under the wheels with the sale of our half-wheels industry to the Chinese in the increasing chip war between the United States and China, the political genius in the chancellor's office is silent. A huge sargnagel more in the de-industrialization policy of Germany!
3215	1	Making science ridiculous
3215	3	"The times in which Germany was considered the country of researchers and engineers, and the word “scientists” had a fearful sound, are already slowly over. Two-and-a-half years of Corona policy, in which scientists used to how propagandaists appear with Pope's claims of insolvency, and study interruptors with political mandate ""the science"" like a cage before themselves to make other thinkers silent, have already harshed the reputation of the incentive."
3215	5	The next stage of the reputation damage has been introduced by the climate fanatics of an obscured new group called “Scientist Rebellion”: a crowd of climate crabs who hold themselves in the exhibition room of an automotive company and bitterly complain that light and heating come out at night, and there are no hips, drinks and night drinks.
3215	7	9 members of #ScientistRebellion stay clothed in the @Autostadt tonight.
3215	9	Normally, @Volkswagen operates lobbyism in Berlin & Brussels. Today we ask CEO #OliverBlume to do lobby work for the climate. 
3215	11	Scientists with a sudden look
3215	13	However, with the scientific competence of people who do not think about such elementary parameters when planning their action, it cannot be far away. You prefer not to know how it goes in their labs, if they’ve ever seen one from inside. Where the scientific message is to be, when some curved shapes, with a furious look in front of an exhibited sports car on the ground, do not uncover to the non-sect believer.
3215	15	Activists are still activists even if they are surrounded by a white lab. And infantile Klamauk remains infantile Klamauk, who is all nervous and no one is convinced, even if he comes therein in the name of any “science”. If this is the new idea of science in the Green Clown Republic of Germany – then thank you, but no thank you.
3216	1	World Cup in Qatar: Change through cow trade
3216	3	Healthy Human Intelligence Change Through Cow Trade
3216	5	For a long time I had the hope that the World Cup in Qatar would still be broken down. The fact that the corrupt FIFA still comes to mind is that you simply don’t do such a fool. But that was extremely naive. The mafia becomes a men's song union.
3216	7	A short-term cancellation of the tournament would have released me from a moral dilemma. How should I, as a football lover, deal with this world championship? Do I feel guilty when I watch them on TV? I am really interested in the games. On the other hand, I would emphasize FIFA and Co in their assumption that football fans can do anything.
3216	9	Of course, the award of the World Cup to Qatar is one of the foolishest actions in football history, yes, a groundless foolishness. It is likely (as the award of the 2006 World Cup to Germany) to be the result of corruption. It is a climate disaster. This is primarily a human rights disaster. Because of them thousands of workers who built the sports facilities fell to the victims. And because it serves a dictatorship against human rights as a marketing and PR measure that wants to wash itself white with the glow of popular sports.
3216	11	"As the profitable football-functionaries-elite deals with Qatar, Franz Beckenbauer, known in the people's mind as ""Emperor"", has already demonstrated in all beauty early. When he was interviewed after a visit to Qatar on the faults on the buildings and the situation of the working slaves: “So, I have not yet seen a single slave in Qatar. They all run free,” he said. The people there were not attached to chains, nor had they any bottle on their head. Since then, I have no longer called Beckenbauer Emperor, but Emir. For years, the motto was: Nothing to hear, nothing to see. Yet something to say. And casing of course."
3216	13	Others, such as Sigmar Gabriel, the Uli Hoeneß of the SPD, don’t deny all the misconduct in Qatar, but refer to the enormous progress that it is also supposed to have been done due to the World Cup release. Change through cow trade. How effective this procedure is, the last judge of the World Cup has been seen: Vladimir Putin’s Russia.
3216	15	On the other hand, we can already wonder if football fans really need to be more consistent in dealing with the dictatorship in Qatar than, let’s say, the German Vice Chancellor, who, in the hope of liquid gas, even made a bowl before the Emir.
3216	17	As a football fan who is tested in dirty compromises, I am naturally grateful to Habeck. He is almost my Alibi. And when the next time a dictatorship with the world’s largest football party is adultered, I really don’t look at it anymore. Entirely in real.
3217	1	Ricarda Lang warns of RAF comparisons
3217	3	Green Party leader Ricarda Lang has taken the climate group “Last Generation” in protection from comparison with a “climate-RAF”. The Red Army Group (RAF) killed with weapons and explosives, more than 30 people had lost their lives by the terrorists, Lang told the newspaper of the Funke media group. “Whoever pulls parallels here and calls the current protests with the RAF in a breath, shrinks the terror at that time and shrinks the suffering of the victims and the remains,” Lang said, adding that “there is verbal disarmament.”
3217	5	CSU country group chief Alexander Dobrindt had called on in the “Image on Sunday” to prevent the formation of a “climate-RAF”. On Tuesday, Dobrindt confirmed the word choice. The RAF has been considered in the Federal Republic for decades as an involvement of terrorism and murder. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, more than 30 people were killed. Recently, the son of a RAF opper had also spoken with Michael Buback and was concerned about a possible radicalization of the climate protests.
3217	7	The EU faction, however, calls for further penalties against climate activists who block roads or attack artworks in museums. However, stricter laws are not necessary. “For this, our rule of law provides sufficient funds,” she said. However, she criticized the “Last Generation” forms of protest as counterproductive. “When a protest leads to no more talk about the matter, but only about the form of the protest, this proves a bar service,” she said.
3217	9	Green Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann also criticized the “Last Generation” protests as counterproductive. If one chooses a form of protest that leads to the rejection by the majority, it only damages the climate protection goal, the politician said at the “Southwest Press” forum on Tuesday night in Ulm. Civil disobedience must also be free of violence, Kretschmann said. “Protest should not have a change in the matter as a goal, but only the appeal to it.”With the Greens, for example, as part of the federal government, there are a lot of possibilities to change something and get involved.
3217	11	Habeck and Künast on a distance
3217	13	In addition to Kretschmann, the economic minister Habeck had distanced himself from the blockades (“bad and harmful”), as well as Green politician Renate Künast.
3217	15	The 66-year-old indicated the protesters in an indirect interview of lack of effectiveness. “I want us to go on the matter, but we have been discussing for days whether potato bread on artworks is an appropriate form of demonstration,” the 66-year-old told Star magazine. Thus, the group managed to get into the “day show,” Künast said. “But it has changed nothing.”
3218	1	You will be. Well well!
3218	3	The 2,000 people were stuck in the festival hall of the Münchner Hofbräuhause, as on the 24th. In February 1920 the NSDAP was founded. Also on 9. In November 1938, a “gigant business” ruled in the Old Town Hall, as Joseph Goebbels proudly stated in his diary. Everything waited for the minister of propaganda to give an encouragement to the Reichspogromnacht with a short speech. If the untouchable Munich comfort reaches its settlement point, you should be a thousand kilometers away.
3218	5	"When a press conference on “Post-Shoah-Antisemitism” took place recently in the same festival hall of the Old Town Hall in Munich, there was no “gigant business”. Ten journalists lost themselves in the large hall. The Research and Information Centre Antisemitism (RIAS) Bayern presented its latest publication: “Multi-directional attacks on memory” (online available at report-antisemitism.de). On 112 pages, the surprisingly diverse faces of current anti-Semitism (not only in Bavaria) are presented and analyzed – from the yellow star with the title “unvaccinated” to the “post-colonial” anti-Semitism of the Documenta. The longest chapter documented the anti-Jewish attacks in Germany since 1945. It begins with a street battle between at least 1,000 Jewish protesters and the Munich police on the 10th. August of 1949. The wrath of the protesters was directed against a reader's letter of ""Adolf Bleibtreu"", which appeared a day earlier in the ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"", who described the surviving Jews as ""blood-sugarers"" and regretted that ""we haven't lost all."""
3218	7	"The Adolf Bleibtreus of today formulate more subtle. by 50. The anniversary of the Olympia attack in Munich appeared, for example, in the ""Landshuter Zeitung"" readers' letters, which took the gezerre for a compensation for the remaining to finally say again what you will probably be able to say. There is the word of “offering abuse to enrich” or of “the humiliation of the victims by raffering.” Nothing is known about the prosecutors' investigations against readers or publishers."
3219	1	Anti-Wokeness Congress in Berlin: Only Rhetorical Question Signs
3219	3	The Conservative Thinking Factory R21 tries against the left identity policy. There is rational criticism to be heard – but a lot of things go into affective.
3219	5	On the event poster, a face with a large plaque is caught in front of the mouth. “Wokes Germany – Identity policy as a threat to our freedom?” is the title of the related first event of the new liberal-conservative thought factory R 21 on Monday in Berlin. You feel like the plate is called, made mounted by the woken left. The question mark in the title is retorical.
3219	7	The thought factory is not a pure CDU club. It includes the author Ahmad Mansour and the ethnologist Susanne Schröter. But CDU member and historian Andreas Rödder and former family minister Kristina Schröder are two picturesque figures trying to fill the sense vacuum of the Union after 16 years Angela Merkel conservative.
3219	9	According to Rödder, one understands himself “as a bourgeois, democratic center” which warns against right-wing populism as well as against the woke left. One key question, however, is whether the conservative criticism of identity policy holds a sufficient distance to the right-populist enemy determination.
3219	11	As a rather left critic appears on Monday the theaterman Bernd Stegemann, once Sahra Wagenknecht’s counterpart in the failed Rise movement. He criticizes the “progressive neoliberalism” that puts on gender stars rather than on redistribution.
3219	13	“New State Society”
3219	15	“Amazon is free of discrimination and without trade unions,” Stegemann said. The woke capitalism replaces more salary with more recognition. Furthermore, the barrier on the speaker’s position with sacrificed attributes heavens the core of democracy, “the unnecessary force of the better argument” (Habermas) under equals. This is not new, but a rational criticism.
3219	17	FDP politician Linda Teuteberg considers the practice of “deploying people into intrinsic group affiliations and knowing only victims and privileged people” as unliberal. This creates the danger of a “new state society” that is centered on victims groups.
3219	19	Wokeness reads the FDP woman as an expression of a growing “demand for uncertainty” and the inability to tolerate multi-certainty. The latter is always true. Teuteberg formulates her criticism pleasantly relaxed and without lifting protective tombs.
3219	21	Another, much more scary sound is the ex-Bild editor Judith Basad. She had resigned at Springer because the publisher had distanted itself from a text in the world. In this, ARD and ZDF had been attacked because they were allegedly “indoctrinating our children” and being subdued by activists with a “woken” trans-ideology.
3219	23	Almost North Korea
3219	25	It sounds like AfD. Basad, who is currently working in the company of ex-Bild chief Julian Reichelt, indicates the Springer magazine’s retireer as a menetekel. The woke movement is “the greatest danger for our society” and “more powerful than any extreme right movement can be right now,” she says.
3219	27	The Woke movement has captured the main media and built “a tyrannia.” Following this image, we live in a kind of identity policy of North Korea. The cautious insight of the moderator and NZZ editor Alexander Kissler that the image is actually not a central body of Wokeness, spreads to it.
3219	29	Basad's appearance, a lot flattered, stunningly questioned, illuminates a surprising trail of antiwokeness: she repeats in a mirror the victim scene of her enemy. The imagination of living in a totalitarian system that strangulates every freedom and in the “power of the Mobs” (Basad) also conservatory media houses is a kind of echo of some identity policy structures of a comprehensive racist or colonial system.
3219	31	One of the strangers of the Anti-Woken is the ritual proclamation that identity policy is not interested in real life. This stands in an immediate contradiction to the rocky belief that it has to do with an overpowerful enemy.
3219	33	from blase to blase
3219	35	Historic Sandra Kostner testifies to a powerful trend towards the “moralization of science”. As proof of the influence of leftwoker irrationality, she leads the magazine Nature, which recently proclaimed: “Research must do no harm”, research should make a bull on racism, sexism, homofobia and hate speech. Why this should be a serious limitation of scientific freedom remains unclear.
3219	37	Thus, in this event we hear quite cool-rational defences of Republican principles against the claim of identity-political special rights. But some of them go into affection. Critical oppositions were not invited to be cautious. This sometimes leads to the bizarre effect that with a lot of verve woke bluses are attacked – and you actually do it in an anti-woke bluse.
3219	39	Diffus remains whether to prevent the escalation and sharp hostility, as it exists in the United States, as the power of the “democratic center” (Rödder) – or secretly desire for it. Ex-Bild editor Basad believes that a striking anti-woke movement will develop in Germany, including leading figures such as Canadian Professor Jordan Peterson.
3219	41	Learn from Obama
3219	43	Kristina Schröder considers the success of identity policy as a failure of the Union. “Many have thought, that’s so stumbled, that’s going to do itself.” Andreas Rödder finally announces that it will lead a cultural struggle against “moralizing overwhelming.” It sounds like a threat.
3219	45	Former U.S. President Barack Obama once warned the leftist movements in the US: “Don’t be too woke.” More than in R21.
322	1	Accelerate: You’ll experience a very busy journey
322	3	Regular readers of my books and these pages will understand that the financial chaos that sweeps the world and that Britain threatens to send beyond the recession into a deep, dark financial depression and back into the dark economic era, nothing of what is happening is random.
322	5	This is, if you still have doubts, the beginning of the Great Recession, the New Normality, with which the conspirators have been struggling for years.
322	7	(Let’s say there are some unknown collaborators who claim that the “Great Recession” is another conspiracy theory. If you have the right.)
322	9	The upcoming financial chaos has been recorded many years ago.
322	11	When I scored my book in 2012! I wrote, I pointed out: the government can no longer afford to pay the pensions it has promised to the public sector workers. The government cannot afford to pay the state pension. And overall, the policies of the government and the EU have destroyed the attractiveness of private pensions. In one generation, our streets will be full of betrayed English betlers who pray that you give them enough money to eat and buy something.
322	13	Now we are very close to it.
322	15	The current dispute in the UK between the apparently chaotic and devastating government Truss and the apparently incompetent Bank of England prepares us all for a perfect financial armageddon.
322	17	The Bank of England says that our financial problems are caused by the government’s spending policy (what is true). The government says the Bank of England had to raise interest rates faster (which is also true).
322	19	Meanwhile, the British pension funds break down, and millions who had been pleased with an adequate retirement can now look forward to poverty and the need to work until the fall. And the Governor of the Bank is with the Chancellor in Washington. I’m sure you’ll have fun there. Can I suggest you stay there?
322	21	The British pension funds are in a gap because of the double policy of the Bank of England and the new government. But Bailey, who, as the bank's governor, receives more than half a million pounds a year (and who can rightly claim to be the most decently paid Witzbold of the UK), says that the problem is the debt of the pension funds because they do what they are forced to do – that is, to hold government bonds – and that they should fix the chaos. State bonds (including indexed state bonds) have experienced a never-presumed breakdown.
322	23	In these days, a lot of strange things happen. They are all unprecedented and seemingly unexplicable.
322	25	But remember, nothing happens randomly.
322	27	When one first understands what’s going on, it’s remarkable to simply understand how the conspirators drive Britain into a real, deep and lasting depression. The International Monetary Fund says that 2023 will be worse than 2022. And the unanimous opinion is that Britain is in a worse gap than any other country. We are deep in the land of Orwell.
322	29	(Citizens of other countries should not laugh too much. All other countries are also suffering from a financial disaster. The only difference is that the UK will be the first to arrive there.)
322	31	Wherever you look, everywhere you are lying, misleading and misleading.
322	33	The government says the unemployment rate is low.
322	35	But this is just a refined manipulation.
322	37	The fact is that millions of unhappy, innocent young people study at the university to acquire degrees in subjects such as “golf field management”. How many thousand golfers the world needs?
322	39	These unhappy children are at the university only because they do not get into unemployment. (The exams have been significantly simplified to increase the number of students allegedly qualified for further education). They pay a wealth for fees and accommodation (and there are huge debts), and when they finally have their degree, they will have difficulties in finding a job. Most of them will never be able to refund their study credits. Her education will leave her with nothing but happy Saturday night memories and huge, eternal debt.
322	41	And then there are still millions of people seeking social aid. They are, of course, not counted in the unemployment numbers, and their numbers have been increased by the 2 million people suffering from the Happy Furlough syndrome (which is often falsely called “Long Covid” by collaborating, heart-death journalists). These people have the months of paid holidays so much that they don’t want to go to work anymore. And Long Covid (the joy of the hypochonders) has solved “I have back problems, Mr. Doctor” and “I suffer from stress, Mr. Doctor” as the main cause that people are too sick to work.
322	43	The errors who now lead the plant are determined to worsen the situation further by allowing the recipients to increase inflation, rather than limiting them to the salary increases that workers and strikers will receive.
322	45	This will, of course, encourage more millions of people to give up the thought of work and instead join the 2 million people who enjoy the Happy Furlough syndrome.
322	47	Meanwhile, commentators, politicians and journalists desperately try to keep the interest rates low to protect the approximately one million people who have accepted mortgages. Too many have assumed that the absurdly low interest rates are long-lasting – and they have failed to prepare, plan and save.
322	49	No one is curious about the countless millions who have scratched and saved and who now get as well as no interest on their savings. (One day the constantly unmediate banks will have to start making money. They borrow money at 0.1% and borrow it at 6%. Even courageous banks should be able to make money with these numbers.)
322	51	A young writer for a cross-regional publication claimed that the pension crisis is no reason to worry. If you are shortly ahead of retirement, you just have to postpone your retirement for a few years,” the calming council said. And if you’re younger, just pay more money into your retirement to balance the losses.
322	53	Heaven knows what is advised to those who manage their pensions themselves and who, if they were cautious, have lost up to one-third of their pension funds on a day.
322	55	It is clear that in the Great Reset there is no place for self-responsibility. A little grain for the wet, difficult years to go away is money waste.
322	57	The government does not want the people to do that. She wants everyone to depend on her. This is why social benefits are increased. That’s why the government is spending money that it doesn’t have, in the form of energy limitations and massive contributions to.
322	59	The government does not want you to be independent. She wants to control you and everything you do. In their new world, independence is a wicked concept.
322	61	The release was part of control. The energy limits are part of control. The low interest rates (most below inflation) are part of control.
322	63	They want us to feel “righted” and “dependent” – and under their control.
322	65	What is happening in the United Kingdom is happening everywhere. The U.S. has made massive rescue actions.
322	67	If the energy prices continue to rise (what will happen as long as the crazy sectorers spread the myth of global warming and as long as the sanctions against Russia areined), the state debt will continue to rise.
322	69	To survive without being “buy” by the tricks of the conspirators, we have to cut our spending, stretch the belt and avoid buying large household assets. Now it’s not time to buy a new house, a new car or a new sofa.
322	71	Look at your pension and be ready to change your expectations. It may be that you are no longer able to retire as you planned.
322	73	Disbelieve the government, avoid the mass media and defend yourself against lies.
322	75	And please share this article with everyone you know.
322	77	I apologize for the lack of videos. Apart from the copies that still exist, all the original of my videos have been banned, censored or hacked and seem to have disappeared. It's dark and difficult times, and I'm afraid they'll become darker and more difficult.
3220	1	Hot party in the climate club
3220	3	Hunger due to extreme droughts, thousands of deaths after floods, melting glaciers, rising sea levels: the reports of the climate crisis and its consequences are not only increasing, but also increasing dramatic. But the message that humanity is “on the highway to the climate hell with the foot on the gas pedal,” as UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Monday to the opening of the World Climate Conference COP 27 in Sharm al-Sheikh, Egypt, is unlikely to come to the heads of state and government. Especially not those from the global north – that is, the main causes of the climate disaster.
3220	5	For example, the BRD. Instead of making concrete announcements in the fight against the global warming, Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz on Tuesday in Sharm Al-Scheich just for his idea of a “global climate club”. He urged all countries around the world to participate in this, without explaining exactly why such a “climate club” is necessary to implement climate and environmental protection.
3220	7	"Scholz also warned of a “Renaissance of fossil energies,” which triggered intense criticism among climate defenders and environmental associations. “It’s not the first time he does this,” said Till Groth, an expert in international climate policy at the Federation for Environment and Conservation (BUND), on Tuesday. “In July, this formulation was surprising, but months ago, for example, with the then Colombian president, he had already explored the possibilities for an increased import of coal to Germany,” Groth said. In addition to the prolonged flow of coal and nuclear energy in Germany, the talks on the expansion of gas supply in Africa are a strong warning signal, he continued. ""Scholz is not only opposed in its policy, but would further burn the global climate crisis with the further expansion of fossil energies,"" Groth said."
3220	9	The theme at the COP 27 on Tuesday was also the aid needed by the global south to protect the climate. This referred to a study published on the same day to approximately $2.4 trillion per year by 2030. Financing is needed to reduce emissions, increase resilience, address damage caused by climate change and restore nature and land, the conference’s organizers ordered study says.
3220	11	It’s a “happy promise” that Scholz has promised €170 million for a global risk protection screen, BUND expert Groth said. But the amount is “too small.”
3220	13	The fact that the COP 27 will not take decisive measures against the climate crisis, Helge Peukert is not surprised. “If nothing has happened at 26 conferences before, why should it work at the 27th?” asked the professor of Plural Economics at the University of Victory in a conversation with the newspaper. Asked why the COP 27 was condemned to fail, he replied: “In the short term, tens of thousands of people from many countries are invited and declared as climate representatives. States that do not participate have benefits. Everything that is decided is unbinding, and if you get out of the treaties after the conference, then that’s not a problem – it can’t work!”
3221	1	Time goes off
3221	3	Dirty words were the words that Admiral Charles A. Richard, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, said in the middle of last week and who are now on the way through some U.S. military platforms also find the way in the news media. The Ukrainian war? It’s just “the upheating phase,” Richard oracleed. “The great thing,” means the conflict between the United States and China, is coming closer now, and it will probably take a short time, “until we stand before the trials that we have long failed to stand before.” How the conflict is shrinking in detail, what “examinations” therefore will be exactly, Richard did not let himself out of it. His Strategic Command does nothing less than the U.S. nuclear forces.
3221	5	"Warnings from a large, nuclear escalating war between the United States and China have been in the United States for years. Former NATO commander James Stavridis has described such a war to trigger a broad debate, in a novel published in early 2021 he called ""2034"". He has been criticized by military colleagues in view of the title: War is likely to start significantly earlier, some said – in 2026, in 2024. Earlier in August, the Wall Street Journal published a long post entitled “The upcoming war around Taiwan” – without any questioning. That the danger of war is very real, there is no illusion about it in the U.S. political establishment."
3221	7	What made Richard’s statements not a little disappointed was exactly something different. When he looks at “the level of our afraid to China,” the U.S. Admiral said, then he comes to the conclusion: “The ship falls so slowly.” The once believed U.S. advance on military territory – it shrinked there at a high speed. In the submarine capabilities, the U.S. military continued to clearly have the nose ahead, but otherwise hardly yet. It is now necessary to quickly break the row in arms.
3221	9	What about the statements of the Admiral? Now, the so-called War Games in Washington have repeatedly suggested for years that the United States could no longer win a war against the People's Republic. In certain types of weapons, such as hyperscalled missiles, China is already in the forefront today. The fact that Richard demands a higher pace in deforestation is his job. Only: Whoever considers a great war as likely, maybe even unavoidable – and so many in Washington do – will look for it at a time at which he is at least partially military overlooking. If Richard is right, then this is not the case in the United States for a long time. The time to decide the hot power struggle for the global hegemony is coming closer.
3222	1	Climate Change: Can the individual really make a difference?
3222	3	You should not use plastic clothes. You should not eat avocado. You shouldn’t fly to Mallorca!!! What sounds like output from the Ten Commandments for the Rescue of the Climate is actually perceived by many people as well: they try to fix their lives on it. What in many cases causes them to feel bad when they fail.
3222	5	But is that true at all? Would the climate change really stop if all people had abandoned plastic bags and switched to ecosystem? How large is the scope of individual action? And where does the state have to run, and the policy to push systemic changes? We have listed for the areas of transport, energy, agriculture, housing and industry in Germany how many individual life and consumer decisions can be made. And where our area of influence ends as individuals and the state has to take over.
3222	7	The light is shut down, or the power plant?
3222	9	The number one cause of greenhouse gases in Germany is the energy industry: for this, all those emissions that power plants cause when they produce electricity and heat are counted. If there is coal, gas, or oil burned there, CO2 will be produced, any amount of which: 222 million tons in 2020.
3222	11	If we switch to renewable energy, we avoid emissions: Last year, renewables covered 42 percent of electricity production in Germany and 16.5 percent of heat production.
3222	13	What can each individual do to make the energy sector free of emissions? Of course, the thing seems to be on the hand: switching to an ecosystem provider. For a provider with the Ok-Power label or the Green-Strom label, this will bring at least a little bit of something. These power suppliers actively promote the energy transition. But it is far from enough. Approximately half of the electricity in Germany is consumed by the industry, households around a quarter. Let’s assume that every person in Germany would switch to an ecosystem provider. And that would also mean that because of our contract, more ecosystem is actually produced, which is often not the case so far. Even then, industry, business, trade and services would still be responsible for three-quarters of electricity consumption. First of all, the system needs to be fundamentally changed.
3222	15	Our energy consumption will increase in the future. Cars are designed to drive electric, heat pumps heat our houses, and green hydrogen, produced with renewables, is intended to be available as fuel for the industry. The Think-Tank Agora Energy Transition predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2045.
3222	17	In order for this electricity to be renewable, we need not only a massive expansion of wind and solar energy. We also need storage options because it’s not always windy or sunny, and an improved electricity exchange within Europe. In addition, we need to use the existing electricity more intelligently – so for example, the industry consumes a lot of electricity especially when there is just a lot of electricity there.
3222	19	Of course, everyone and every individual can and should save electricity by switching off the light out or the stand-by mode of the TV: According to the non-profit consulting company co2online, we could save more than 15 million tons of CO2 if all private households in Germany would fully exploit their power potential. This sounds like a lot, but it is only 7 percent of what the energy industry has caused in 2020. So whoever has the choice to exchange all the lamps through energy-saving lamps for a afternoon or to go on the street – yes, he should probably prefer to touch the poster and the triller pipe.
3222	21	Internal flights are no matter. How to please?
3222	23	Per the emergence of the term “flight sham” marks that moment as the discussion of the climate harmfulness of our mobility has become entirely moral: What, you are flying yet?!? Or vice versa: What, you want to make the people get their well-worth holidays in Mallorca?!? Here is a proposal for dismissal.
3222	25	The transport sector within Germany – thus first without international flights and ships – accounts for one-fifth of the national greenhouse gases. About 60 percent of these emissions are caused by cars – domestic flights only 1.4 percent. The aircraft is the most dangerous means of transport. But because we drive so many cars in the country and fly so little, the flights hardly fall into weight.
3222	27	Per this is why the area of traffic is so morally charged because the scope for individual decisions seems to be high here – eventually everyone decides whether to sit in the car for his way to work or on a bicycle. In 2020, 68 percent of people answered this question with the key to the car. But: Whoever has any alternatives available, we as individuals cannot influence it at all. Well-built bicycle routes and reliable public transportation can only plan, expand, finance municipalities and the state.
3222	29	But now let’s look at all the emissions associated with mobility of people in Germany, including travel abroad, then flights cause 27 percent – the majority of flights abroad. A little less than one-third of the flights are professional, two-thirds make private or holiday trips. Therefore, the individuals have a big hole.
3222	31	If all people in Germany would stop flying, we could save about 60 million tons of greenhouse gas, about as much as the entire agriculture! However, we would probably then use other means of transport to go on holiday – this would reduce the savings again.
3222	33	One last, important point: the inequality of travel. According to a study on behalf of the Federal Environmental Office, about half of people did a maximum of three trips a year, but seven percent did 20 trips or more.
3222	35	This message is addressed to Cementworks owners:in
3222	37	Illustration: Friday, Material: Unsplash, iStock
3222	39	Almost a quarter of Germany’s emissions are due to the industry: of course, we are still an industrial country! This is especially about the especially energy-intensive industries such as the steel, chemical and cement industries. The steel industry alone generates approximately six percent of all emissions in Germany. The steel produced thereafter is further processed by other industries: more than half of the steel is consumed by the construction and automotive industry.
3222	41	Now one or the other will think, but I have no cementwork at all! I can’t decide either. What is of course right. Or very much about politics. It has done to make the industry green hydrogen and CO2 separation neutral. In the National Hydrogen Strategy for 2020, the then federal government expects a hydrogen need of 90 to 110 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2030, with the majority of this green hydrogen coming from abroad.
3222	43	The challenge is enormous, according to a comparison by the International Energy Agency: Only to make green today’s global hydrogen consumption, we needed approximately 3,600 TWh of renewable energy per year – more than the whole EU currently produces electricity per year.
3222	45	Can we influence the industry in any way? Well, we could take the words of manufacturers like Volvo, Mercedes-Benz or BMW, or their announcements, to want to sell the first green steel cars in the coming years. Currently there is no. The construction of hydrogen-electrolysis plants and pipelines for the transport of hydrogen cannot be affected, except by making political pressure.
3222	47	What we can do as individuals is not to buy a car. Not to buy things or just to buy things is the greatest height we have over our consumption in the industry. This also applies to goods that are not manufactured in Germany.
3222	49	The full rehabilitation! Or just a silicone.
3222	51	On the fourth place in the greenhouse gases, the building sector falls – or on the first place, depending on how you calculate. In the statistics of the Federal Environment Ministry, electricity production in power plants is one of the emissions of the energy industry – even if we then consume the electricity in our homes. The same applies to remote heat.
3222	53	To reduce the emissions that are associated with how we live, we need to do two things above all. The houses should be better isolated so that fewer heat escapes. Heating needs to be climate-neutral. Instead of gas, for example, an electric heat pump or earth heat should heat the house.
3222	55	There was a huge sanitation wave needed. But how should it go? Let’s assume that all the people who live in their own house would now let it recover immediately. First, there would still be schools, public buildings and. Nearly 60% of all households in Germany live for rent. The decision whether and how and when your apartment will be renovated is not in your hands. For the tenants there is so far little incentive to repair because they don’t pay the energy costs and therefore have nothing about the savings. However, this “leader-leader dilemma” will now be resolved by the lighting government by dividing the CO2 costs for heating fairer between rental and rental. The worse the energy efficiency of a building, the greater the share the tenant must pay. This increases the incentive for repair.
3222	57	The challenges are yet enough. For example, such a sanitation offensive requires a lot of craftsmen. In an analysis of the mirror, Karlsruher Facility Management Professor Kunibert Lennerts estimates that about 350,000 employees would be missing if the repair rate would be doubled to the required two percent of all buildings per year. So limiting the emissions of the building sector is a huge logistical task – which the government has to coordinate. We individuals can either repair our house if we can afford it. Or at least the windows are better.
3222	59	Can I buy Avocados?
3222	61	Some know the dilemma: you try to eat less meat. They are proud of cheese bread. Only to read later, that we have not done so much in terms of emissions: Cheese still generates half as much CO2 as if we had eaten the cow directly. The same in green applies to many who try to eat as vegan as possible. So no cheese anymore – instead of avocado as a bread-up. Unfortunately, they often come from Peru or Chile and are transported only around the world before they are in our supermarket – with the corresponding CO2 balance. Maybe it’s best to eat nothing?
3222	63	Considering the emissions of agriculture in Germany, we see that much of it is caused by animal welfare – 60 percent. Could we save these 60% emissions if we all were to eat completely vegan? No is. Fewer animal products mean fewer emissions, but we would have to produce more fertilizers, for example, because there would be no more rubber. This also causes emissions. It is unrealistic that we all will become vegans from today to tomorrow. In fact, systemic change could also lead to a lot in agriculture. Regulations that ensure less fertilizer is emitted on the fields would lead to fewer lax gas – a greenhouse gas that works significantly stronger than CO2.
3222	65	Another question many are asking themselves in the supermarket: organic or conventional? Bio-agriculture produces fewer greenhouse gases per surface. However, the revenue per area is also less, so it is approximately similar. However, organic farming is significantly better for species diversity than conventional. But if we ate ourselves as we are now, we needed more soil if we all wanted to eat only organic foods. Unless we eat more vegan, then the land area would be free again – animal welfare consumes more area than when we grow food directly for humans.
3222	67	In general, the diet can have a relatively large influence on the individual climate footprint. But: A fast emission of coal would have a much greater effect than when individuals eat vegan, regional and seasonal or buy organic. The production of electricity from coal caused 123 million tons of CO2 in 2020 – almost twice as much as the total agriculture.
3222	69	Back to the Avocado: In 2018, according to the Federal Bureau of Statistics, 94,000 tons of avocados were imported. According to the Federal Environment Office, a kilogram of avocado has a CO2 footprint of 0.6 kilograms of greenhouse gases. This makes about 0.06 million tons of greenhouse gas for all 94,000 tons of avocados. So little? This is just a small individual decision. It also shows what our energy should be focused on rather than showing with the finger on our avocado toasts – for example on the coal rise.
3222	71	Those who consume their mental energy with decisions such as “Bio in plastic packaging or conventionally unpacked?”, “Cake from Brandenburg or Sojaschnitzel from Denmark?”, can quietly give themselves a piece of sandwich to the baker. Funking out, while the fire next to it continues to burn more, does not bring us further. Especially if we forget to take the edge – and begin to delete it.

3223	1	Europe on the short line of the United States
3223	3	It is known that the Russian television has a slightly different view of the events in Europe than the German television. Therefore, this week I also translate the report of the Russian German correspondent, which was shown on Sunday in the weekly news review of the Russian television.
3223	5	The beginning of translation:
3223	7	How the US keeps Europe on the short line
3223	9	It was an impressive marathon of summits – G7, NATO and before the Council of Europe – in the summer break there will be a lot to discuss. The Weathersteing Mountains, at the foot of which the G7 host hotel is located Elmau Castle, appears to have even pulled the globalization opponents into its ban – the police replaced two ads and eaten 80.234 pieces of chocolate.
3223	11	And the reception in Real de Madrid – meaning the Royal Palace – glowed on the occasion of the reunion of the Alliance: Throne Hall, Gold, Purple. Queen Letizia came unexpectedly in black, but was astonishing as always. At the Galadinner, Hungarian Prime Minister Orban was sitting next to the homosexual partner of Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, so they probably had a lot to discuss. However, this was not shown by the cameras because they were targeted on bids. The US president was somehow confused, should he not sit next to the king? Or not? and anm. by d. Over the.Showing how Biden is somewhat confused standing next to the king and trying to understand where he should sit)
3223	13	The good thing is that there are still some fixed points in his world. He said, “Who is guilty of inflation and fuel prices? of Russia. Who is responsible for the food crisis? Russia »
3223	15	After Russia and of course Putin, the main words of the week were “unity” and “solidarity” and also “oil”. Nothing new. The main conclusion is always the same: if the United States withdraws from all Western structures, everything will collapse immediately.
3223	17	They laughed a lot – especially in Elmau – and seemed demonstratively relaxed, even a little too much – as if they were happy and angry at the same time. “Putin must not win in Ukraine” is the thesis that Macron and Scholz repeat almost daily, but neither the French president nor the German Bundeskanzler know how they can that. You are sorry to think about something. Boris Johnson is frustrated that he could no longer travel to Kiev. “It is very important to travel to Ukraine, especially in this difficult time. We are worried that some Ukraine fatigue will spread around the world,” Johnson said.
3223	19	Johnson himself has been in Kiev twice in the last few months – for himself and for Biden. This is the last time Macron, Scholz and Draghi. He felt Selensky “on the tooth” if he didn’t want negotiations with Moscow. Berlin and Paris are known to be very angry about the United Kingdom’s attempts to raise the conflict to a new level – the Kaliningrad transit is its provocation and Lithuania is the dumb executor. London, on its part, suspects its colleagues wanting to clean up the situation as quickly as possible and at least to negotiate something.
3223	21	And these fears are not completely unfounded. On Thursday, France 2 released a documentary entitled “The President, Europe, the War”. It was about Macron and his phone, which was running glowing hot before the active phase of the struggles. Hundreds of hours of talks with Putin. The report’s goal is to show that Macron tried it, but Russia did not want it. The authors give up an important detail: the Russian president has also talked with Macron for a hundred hours. And if it failed, then because Kiev had the more powerful curators than France and Germany, the European guarantees of the Minsk Agreement. And they are guilty of being able to speak with surprise about the results of their contacts with the Kremlin.
3223	23	“After my conversation with Putin, it’s not going to be better. One of the aspects that surprised me most during the conversation is that he did not complain about the sanctions a single time. I don’t know if this was the case in your conversation, but he has not addressed the issue at all,” Scholz told Macron. “The same situation,” Macron replied.
3223	25	and anm. by d. Over the.I would like to see the French report, but unfortunately I can’t speak French. It shows many sections from Macron’s telephone conversations and the fact that it obviously seriously surprised Scholz that Putin has no word to say about the sanctions shows that Scholz really has no idea of Russia at all. Russia has taken the Western sanctions sharply since 2014 and no Russian representative has addressed them on its own basis. But Scholz seems to be overwhelmed by the illusion, Russia should ask for the abolition of the sanctions. This misestimation and this total ignorance of Germany’s most important “adversary” has, honestly, shocked me very much.)
3223	27	Another common in this situation is the opposite effect of sanctions, which can simply become unbearable. What Johnson really disturbs is the fact that his declared willingness to support Ukraine as long as necessary is nothing but a tirade that he properly master well. Making himself a clown, but reacting to the public, he was excellent when he was the mayor of London.
3223	29	This week he is especially on the road. A wave of cartoons: He pulls out next to Putin, shows his breast muscles.
3223	31	and anm. by d. Over the.Johnson said at a photo term at a summit to Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau that they should all go out to show Putin their muscles. Putin said: “I don’t know whether the leaders of the G7 would want to get out above or below the tail, but that would have become a crazy view in any case.”
3223	33	It is suspected that Putin didn’t want to look at it, just like the rest of mankind. But unintentionally, the head cinema begins its destructive game. Or the question of what the old Freud would have said if he had heard such high-quality talks:
3223	35	“I’ve seen the Canadian state pilot. It’s a really big aircraft,” Johnson told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
3223	37	“Not as big as yours,” Trudeau replied.
3223	39	“No, our aircraft is very small.”
3223	41	“We both have very small aircraft.”
3223	43	“Very small.”
3223	45	At the end of the NATO summit, Johnson presented another pearl: he found that Putin, if he was a woman, would never enter Ukraine. For Johnson’s suffering, history does not confirm this: the last time Russia was ruled by a woman, the great Catharina was the one who hit Turkey with great passion and divided Poland again. Currently, the UK is divided.
3223	47	In Northern Ireland, the Separatists recently won the election and this week in Scotland the date was set for another referendum on independence from the United Kingdom – the 19th. October next year. There are many complaints, the latest is that Scotland and Wales are tired of giving money to support Ukraine. It’s time to remember the difference: the Scots and Wales have no more money for the adventures of the Angel Asses, led by the changing parody of a prime minister.
3223	49	At the summit of the North Atlantic Alliance, the Turkish President Erdogan began his conversation with Biden by showing the finger on Johnson and saying, “He there blames us.” When Biden did not notice the hand of South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol, a guest of the meeting that stood directly before him, it is not quite sure whether Biden has understood who was meant with “the there.”
3223	51	The results of the meeting point out two things. The first is the rise of NATO troops on the east side: the rapid intervention force is expected to be increased from 40,000 to 300,000 men. Everyone seems to be involved, but only the United States has real skills.
3223	53	“Without the courageous engagement of the Americans – for example in the form of arms delivery – the Russian troops in Ukraine would probably be already at the east border of the EU. Europe cannot face the threat by Moscow alone. Berlin, Paris and Brussels recognize after this NATO summit that it is a fortune that there is America,” the Spiegel writes.
3223	55	If economic pressure doesn’t work, the U.S. has nothing against increasing military operation: according to Leaks, the Americans are in the process of delivering long-range air defense systems to Ukraine. Only the Russians and Americans play this poker game, the others are statistics. And Bundeskanzler Scholz laughed again. This time, it seems, about itself, because it is not Germany that decides on such issues.
3223	57	“Can you tell us what security guarantees can be given to Ukraine?”
3223	59	“Yes” a break. “I could.” pause “this was,” said Scholz.
3223	61	And another message from Madrid, which one tried to represent as a success: the trilateral memorandum, according to which Turkey is ready to support Finland and Sweden in NATO membership – Biden has even congratulated Switzerland for it. and anm. by d. Over the.Biden confused Sweden and Switzerland during his press conference
3223	63	However, it turns out that the practical implementation of the agreements is seen differently by both sides.
3223	65	Erdogan expects, as he said after the summit, that the Finnish and Swedish will extradite him Kurds and Gulen supporters, a total of 73 people he considers dangerous terrorists. Stockholm and Helsinki have shown themselves cool to these demands, and the Turkish president has stated that his parliament will not take the Scandinavians into the NATO.
3223	67	Whatever it is, the following is now interesting: Federal Chancellor Scholz has rightly pointed out that the prospect of Swedish and Finnish accession to the alliance in Russia is left. And here you can see how self-love Britain’s Foreign Minister Liz Truss lies in this question: “Putin has called both Finland and Sweden’s NATO membership and the weapons supplies from the West to Ukraine as a red line, but that’s just a rhetoric. We must ignore the rhetoric and instead do everything we can to help Ukraine with the weapons it needs to win this terrible war.” by d. Over the.People know that Putin has merely referred to a NATO accession of Ukraine and NATO bases in Ukraine as a red line.
3223	69	Truss, who brings a head-to-head race with her crazy boss and sometimes even overwhelms him, runs around with straw trees if their colleagues want to delete something on the continent. She lies as printed, even to her direct employer – the British parliament.
3223	71	“Saudi Arabia has executed 81 people on a day, and do you think it is an authoritarian regime?” she asked.
3223	73	“I think our country has to deal with the biggest threats in the world. The biggest threat is Russia. And to defeat it, we need access to alternative energy sources in the Gulf,” Truss said.
3223	75	“The newly published trade document says: ‘The government will continue to take responsibility for human rights violators.‘ What have you done with respect to the Gulf states?’” she was asked.
3223	77	“These questions are discussed regularly at meetings with the relevant ministers and department leaders.”
3223	79	“And you’ve met them personally?”
3223	81	“Yes personally.”
3223	83	“But your spokesman said you didn’t meet them. What topic did you discuss in the last meeting?”
3223	85	“For the detail I have to contact the committee.”
3223	87	The only truth is that the West urgently needs a big oil deal. It was like in the 1980s during the war in Afghanistan. After that, Saudi Arabia dropped the oil price, which affected the USSR military budget. During the entire G7 summit, it was about how to remove Russian oil from the market without pushing the prices, which are already at $120 per barrel, further up.
3223	89	“The European Union is moving away from Russian oil. It should not happen that Putin takes this oil and thus goes to the world market, prices rise and he fills the war kases. We need many allies to pay a reasonable but not exorbitant price,” said European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.
3223	91	As part of the solution, the G7 plans to introduce a price limit for Russian fossil power plants, without which suppliers could not guarantee tanks. This is not fun for those for companies that make billions in this business. The idea was immediately rejected by Cyprus. And they invited the Indian Prime Minister to Elmau, who drastically increased the purchase and processing of Russian oil: Will Mr. Modi buy Russian oil at slider prices? However, there is the risk that Russia will reject the sale, so that the BRICS country, which has chosen the path of strategic autonomy, will hardly join the West.
3223	93	The main requirement for the implementation of the plan is the availability of a sufficient amount of relatively cheap Arab oil. That is not and will not be. This message turned out to be so urgent that Macron ignored the confidentiality to send them Biden as quickly as possible before the current cameras: “Joe! Mr President, I apologize. Sorry that I broke you. I had a conversation with the President of the United Arab Emirates about the increase in production. He told me two things. First, I am at the upper border. I fulfill my obligations fully. And secondly, he told me that the Saudis can easily increase their production. And they don’t have much capacity in the next six months.”
3223	95	For Biden, this is an important conclusion before his visit to Saudi Arabia: the Kingdom remains within the framework of the OPEC+ agreement that restricts the possibility of manipulation with Russian energy fraudsters. This was the first time that the sanctions were made.
3223	97	The disagreements between the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany and Japan have prevented them from agreeing on concrete new sanctions. So the group has only agreed to work on new measures – from a price limit for Russian oil to a gold embargo. Since most of the available options to punish Russia in the near future are as well exhausted, only the more difficult and controversial alternatives remain on the table. And that, although they have not yet been questioned correctly about the sanctions they have already conceived and decided. Within the middle of the winter, which the Federal Network Agency calls “partykiller”, you will probably have to take account.
3223	99	The propaganda goes around the hour, but it happens that a British citizen in the morning shuts the television and Bernie Ecclestone, founder of Formula 1, speaks about Putin: “I would still catch a ball for him. It would be better without injuries, but I would catch a ball because he’s a top-class man and does what he thinks is right. He does that for Russia. Unfortunately, all businessmen, including me, make mistakes from time to time. When this happens, you do everything you can to correct it. If everything had been done right... There was a man in Ukraine – as far as I know, he was a comedian. And he seems to want to stay in his profession. I think if he had thought right about it, he would have made enough effort to talk to Mr. Putin – he’s a reasonable man he’d listened to and done something.”
3223	101	For the United States, it is normal that they make trouble across the ocean – they have always won. You hope that this time too. They have fossil fuels, but where the low raw materials Europe wants is unclear. The gas price is at $1,600 per 1,000 cubic meters this week, the underground gas reserves are filled at 60 percent, while 90 percent are the target, and on 11. North Stream-1 will be suspended for 10 days due to maintenance work. And for some reason the German Energy Minister believes that the direct gas supplies from Russia could not be recalled. At the same time, the British regulatory authority has promised that in case of gas problems on the islands, it will interrupt the transit of fuel from the northern seas to the continent. And that should be believed, because something similar has happened before those who have disputed about vaccines.
3223	103	As an option, the German government is considering the nationalization of the Gazprom plants – the land section of North Stream 2 – but the signal is placed: British and Japanese investors have lost billions after they were thrown out of the Russian gas project Sachalin 2 a few days ago. Because of the unfriendly behavior of their governments. A precedent case was created. But since they are still in the adventure of sanctions, they remain in their position. The mirror has described the G7 summit – and also the NATO summit – as a fashionable picture of unity, and Biden can be satisfied with the allies – they will not break off the line.
3223	105	Before an interview with the American broadcaster CBS, Bundeskanz Scholz noted that no one knows when Russia would take out the resources in its confrontation with the West, but that Europe could clearly “burn out” this winter. As an experienced puppy player, the United States is, of course, internally connected with their marionets, especially with the old ones they have learned to manipulate so skillfully. But somewhere in them, Karabas-Barabas is sleeping – then he will wake up and heated the shell with the dolls. and anm. by d.

Today he lives in his election home in St. Petersburg. He has lived in Russia for more than 15 years and speaks fluently Russian. The main points of his media-critical work are the (medial) Russian image in Germany, the criticism of the reporting of Western media in general and the (geo-political) issues and the economy.
3223	113	N&aumlchster post: And when we go before the dogs: the main thing Russia does not win
3224	1	The fault of communism is always the Russians. Posthume renationalization of Soviet history
3224	3	Not later than the end of the Soviet Union, in all its subsequent states, a re-evaluation of the more than seventy-year communist rule, which is rarely free from national egoism, has been applied. In this case, not all sides are just shrinking themselves into the crimes of the Communist regime: it is usually reduced or simply denied!
3224	5	In Kiev and other Ukrainian cities, the road struggles are tightening. No, this time are not the defence struggles of Ukrainian defenders against Russian invaders meant. It is about the “derussification”, the “dekommunization,” say, the “decolonization” of Ukraine. It is unnecessary to emphasize that these terms – at least from the Ukrainian point of view – are synonymous! Only in Kiev, 296 streets will be renamed.
3224	7	The Lenin monuments have long fallen down, the street names of the victorious generals of the Red Army have already been renamed years ago in favour of Ukrainian nationalists from the interwar period – that there were also frequently Nazi laborators and Jewish killer from the Bandera camp: Swam! – and the day of victory over Hitler-Germany was once compatible with the EU and NATO from 9 to 8. May was submitted. On the contrary, the monument for the victims of the “Holodomor” stands in front of the Michael Monastery in Kiev (is it a coincidence that this word applies to another?The Hunger Disaster of 1932/33, since the beginning of the 1990s.
3224	9	Similar things can be seen in another post-Soviet country with NATO ambitions. A “topography of terror”[3] has been found for a few years not only around the former Reichssicherheitshauptamt in Berlin, but also in the Georgian capital Tbilisi. Established with the friendly support of the Heinrich-Böll Foundation. This is the red, especially the Stalinist terror. Through a number of buildings and squares, it is acrylicly demonstrated how the Georgian population had suffered under the communist terror domination.
3224	11	In the subsequent states of the USSR, which speculate on EU and NATO membership, the decommunication is in full course. Parallelly, new national history narratives are boasted, and they usually go beyond a uninterpreted simple phrase: the fault of communism was always the Russians!
3224	13	Therefore, not representatives of a particular ideology were the criminals, but representatives of a particular nation. The same applies to the victims: the victims were not kulaks, small farmers, nobles, priests, dissidents, unpleasant scientists and artists, but just all the peoples of the former Soviet Union – except the Russians! In one word, we are just witnesses to a remarkable historical revisionist process, which could be called somewhat academically blocked as ‘posthume renationalization of Soviet history’.
3224	15	Only the Russians?
3224	17	Of course, these volunteer-constructed scratch narratives back and forward do not agree: Stalin and his famous intelligence chief Lawrentij Berija, for example, were Georgians. Representatives of other nationalities such as the Crown Cities Matrosen striker, Leo Trotsky, the founder of the famous Tcheka, Felix Dserschinski, the directors of the Stalinist shooting processes Wyschinski and Jagoda, as well as the Killer of Katyn and the international translator Anastas Mikoyan were criminals of the Soviet regime.
3224	19	In the Georgian birthplace of Stalin, Gori, located about 60 kilometers west of Tbilisi, there is still a Stalin Museum[4], whose original Soviet depth probably exceeds everything that exists on analogic buildings and monuments in Russia – however, nonewhere in the Georgian “topography of terror” appears. (You can imagine that in Braunau there would still be a museum dedicated exclusively to ‘the great son of Austria’, ‘Hitler wine’ as a merchandising product inclusive!) And at the beginning of the Thirty Years, it was harvested also outside of Ukraine: not least in the fertile Cuba and Black Sea regions, in the North Caucasus and in Kazakhstan. Also, the Russians have caught hundreds of thousands of victims of this state-induced hunger catastrophe.
3224	21	But the new narratives are not just the purification of their own history. At the same time, they can also be instrumentalized adequately for the ideological debate in the New West-Eastern conflict in general and naturally related to Russia’s attack war against Ukraine. In March, a Russian granate hit the Kiev radio on the Melnikowa Street, a few hundred meters from Babij Jar, where at the end of September 1941, SS operating troops with logistical support by the Wehrmacht and Ukrainian assistant police had shot 33.771 Jews within two days, the Russians had shot Babij Jar. Later one was put on. Now it was said: “The whole Ukraine has now become Babij Jar!”[5] The own mediation in this place and the bloody anti-Jewish pogroms by the Ukrainian population at the invasion of the Wehrmacht in Eastern Galizia (now Western Ukraine), which alone in Lemberg (Lviv) caught the victims about 4,000 Jews, were probably hidden.
3224	23	The cautious temptation by the West did not break this. In the course of the Crimean crisis and the war conflict in eastern Ukraine in the spring of 2014, the Greens had – in vain – tried to implement a resolution in the Bundestag on “German’s historic responsibility for Ukraine”. (Today they would be more successful.) It was on 22. June 1941 not the Soviet Union, but Ukraine was invaded by the Wehrmacht. Unwillingly, they asked themselves then, ‘Where is Belarus, that in the second. World War known to have lost a quarter of its population?‘ But at that time not enough White Russians had gone on the streets against President Alexander Lukashenko, so Belarus had to wait until the summer of 2020, in order to enjoy the green special care.
3224	25	The word choice decides
3224	27	How the post-Soviet states process the era of the Soviet Union is their matter. For the debate in Germany I propose the following language use: Not the Ukraine (electional Belarus, Russia) was in the II. World War victims of the most severe German crimes, but on the territory of today's Ukraine (electional Belarus, Russia) were in the II. The worst crimes committed by the Germans. This word choice is a bit more complicated, but it is resistant to posthume nationalist assemblies.
3224	29	The construction of differentiated story stories that overcome in conversation with other affected nations indimensional offender polarisations and step by step integrate their own mediation is an extremely difficult, painful process. It will probably take decades, as not last the ring around the management of the past in Germany has shown.
3224	31	At times, all sides – especially during war times – should at least give up too simple debt allocations.

3225	1	Italy: African Movement in Peschiera Releases Migration Debate
3225	3	of Rome. In Italy, a debate on immigrants from the Maghreb has been burned. Explosive is a pleasant party where the tourist town of Peschiera on the Gardasee was terrorized by thousands of young Arabs and black people. The head of the North League and former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini called for a severe punishment of the Randaliers. He also criticized that a law draft of the League, which provides for full punishment from 15 years, has been blocked for years.
3225	5	2nd Italian National Day. In June, about two thousand people, mostly migrants from the Maghreb, were moved to the town of Peschiera. They had previously met via the social platform TikTok under the motto “L’Africa à Peschiera” (Africa in Peschiera). There were numerous sexual assaults, material damage, theft and massacre.
3225	7	African soldiers attack police in Peschiera
3225	9	As the media reports, a mob moved through the streets and scandalized “this is Africa” and “We’ve come to regain Peschiera.” On parking cars, they were jumped around, scattered windows and thrown around with tables and chairs. Local people and tourists were scared. When the police wanted to calm the situation, she was shot with bottles and stones. “We’ve experienced a day of war,” Peschier’s mayor, Orietta Gaiulli, showed himself shocked.
3225	11	The youth groups were targeting the hunting of Italian girls. A group of sixteen and seventeen-year-old girls how they were sexually harassed in a train station. According to the investigation, “white women have nothing to look for here.”
3225	13	In social media, there are videos to show the excavations.

3225	17	“It was full, it was very hot. We wanted to get out, but they stopped us by triggering the alarm,” the Swiss newspaper quoted one of the victims for 20 minutes. “We have walked through several wagons, and on the way they have reached us everywhere. I broke out in tears and had a panic touch.”
3225	19	Added security forces resolved the collapse in the night. Police in Verona and Milan are currently evaluating the numerous videos and trying to classify crimes to individuals.

3226	1	MOSSAD: “Su-35 destroyed the U.S. base Al-Tanf and gave the friend 36 hours of time to evacuate.”
3226	3	Pentagon threatens direct confrontation between U.S. and Russian soldiers
3226	5	The military operation in Syria has fallen unhappy in our media to reports of special operations and news from Ukraine. As DEBKAfile, the Israeli website specializing in military news services, behind which the MOSSAD and the CIA are suspected, reports, two Russian fighter aircraft Su-35 and Su-24 Al-Tanf have bombed and given the Pentagon 36 hours of time to bring the stars-decorated troops to safety.
3226	7	Here, in the pro-American fighters-controlled area in the Homs province, there is a U.S. military base. The U.S. Garnison controls the main road in Syria, the highway M2 Baghdad-Damascus, and the area within a range of 55 km.
3226	9	Moscow believes that the Yankees are illegally staying in Al-Tanf and attempts to withdraw the unbelievable guests from the area. But when diplomacy was used before, weapons are speaking now.
3226	11	“Michael Curilla, head of the U.S. Central Command, visited the important U.S. base Al-Tanf, located at the border of the Syrian-Irak-Jordan Triangle. In a speech to his soldiers on the ground, General Kurilla spoke very badly about the Russian command in Syria and called on the military to prepare for difficult times,” DEBKAfile wrote.
3226	13	According to the information that is most likely from MOSSAD, the Russians will put the friends under pressure like in ice hockey throughout the field, in a clear attempt to create unbearable service conditions for the U.S. soldiers in NATO’s outside positions in Syria. General Kurilla even permitted a comparison with the following situation: “This is not the dog that bells and does not kiss, it will be the opposite.
3226	15	The escalation between Russian and U.S. soldiers in Syria, according to Jewish experts, is clearly related to the U.S. support for Ukraine. An increase in the temperature in the relations with Moscow in the Middle East today is not in the plans of Washington, which has already enough internal and external problems to deal with.
3226	17	Biden must assure the European allies that he will keep the situation under control with the military aid for the Z team and will not allow the disintegration into a nuclear war.
3226	19	The Pentagon said the opposite. The situation has sharpened so that an escalation of tensions in Syria could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and the United States. The White House has silenced, but it has not rejected its military threats.
3226	21	“US commander and the Pentagon in Washington are also seriously concerned about the enhanced cooperation between Russia and Iran in offensive tactics,” DEBKAfile-Insider said. The Persians are angry on the Yankees because they have failed the nuclear deal 2.0 with Tehran, which again gives Moscow the opportunity to make the life of the Yankees there even more turbulent and dangerous.
3226	23	The air strike on the Al-Tanf base took place on the 18th of May. In June, however, it was seen by the United States as a revenge for militant attacks on Russian positions. Given a strong increase in aviation interruptions in which Russian fighter aircraft fly near threatened U.S. aircraft, the situation for the MOSSAD is expected to further aggravate.
3226	25	The more weapons Kiev receives from NATO, the more hot the situation in the Middle East. It is suspected that Moscow in Syria is exercising pressure on Washington to create the conditions for new contacts between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, especially in the background of the signals from Tel Aviv that the Ayatollah regime has opened the door to the nuclear club. The departure of Bennett as Prime Minister is linked by some in the Jewish state with a horse race, where Putin’s “friend” Netanyahu is to return to the post of head of state.
3226	27	Israel believes that the Kremlin has begun to play the Iranian nuclear card, making Biden a difficult choice. It’s time that Washington decides what’s more important to the states: the state of Bandar or the Jewish state. But the Lord in the White House is clearly foolish and only wants to break time because he doesn’t know what to do. However, this is not the case in which everything will be regulated by itself. According to Tel Aviv, if Moscow chooses a special operation in Ukraine, the situation in Syria will also escalate.
3226	29	No one really knows how the events in the Middle East will develop and how likely a direct confrontation between the U.S. and the Russian troops will be. Many experts are even afraid to think about it, and follow a strange logic: “It can’t be because it can’t be.” And yet, DEBKAfile predicts a Russian offensive in East Syria, until the possible expulsion of the Yankees from Al-Tanf.
3226	31	This is a bad sign for Zelensky as the Ukrainian case in the U.S. is going to be in the background. But it is not excluded that Biden will flee from Syria as he has fled from Afghanistan. The withdrawal from Syria will, of course, not find the political resonance that was to be recorded after the shameful US withdrawal from Kabul. Nevertheless, it will once again confirm that the unipolar world is broken down.
3226	33	This information should be treated very carefully. Remember that DEBKAfile announced the start of the special operation in early February and the 16th. February was first referred to as “Day X”. Then the MOSSAD insiders stated that “the complete disclosure will begin on 22.02.2022, the day of the “six Twins”, almost immediately after the end of the Olympic Games.” As you can see, they were just around a few days.
3226	35	The mainstream media in the United States, such as Fox TV and US Public Radio, gave MOSSAD’s internal information hundred percent faith. The former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke on the 12th. In February they even launched an unusual Schabbat conference on the Ukrainian crisis, where they, together with Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Defense Minister Beni Ganz, discussed a possible conflict in a “non-independent country”. On the other hand,
3226	37	“Svobodnaya Pressa” wrote on the 14th. February about a provokation prepared by the Ukrainian armed forces against the Donbass, which could be the trigger for a Russian attack on Kiev.
3227	1	The actual vaccine effectiveness rates are much lower than previously thought.
3227	3	The effectiveness of the vaccine is one of the most important issues related to the pandemic.
3227	5	Based on the original estimates, which, according to The Experts, was between 95 and 100 percent, global change measures were taken.
3227	7	These numbers are still quoted by politicians and prominent media representatives when they are inevitably positively tested and thanked for the protection the vaccine offered to them.
3227	9	In the press release of Pfizer on the study data, it is explicitly and triumphantly stated that the tests showed a 95% effectiveness of the vaccine:
3227	11	BNT162b2 has met all the primary effectiveness points of the study. The analysis of the data shows a vaccine’s effectiveness rate of 95 % (p<0,0001) in participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary target) and in participants with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary target), each measured from 7 days after the second dose. The analysis of the first primary target was based on 170 cases of COVID-19, as indicated in the study protocol, of which 162 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group compared to 8 cases in the BNT162b2 group. The effectiveness was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity. The observed effectiveness in adults over the age of 65 was over 94%.
3227	13	Shameful discrimination and obsessive comments that the “non-vaccinated” should be banned from society and removed from the health systems were a continuous feature of the post-pandemic era, which is largely due to these estimates.
3227	15	For many prominent international media representatives, this is still part of their COVID discourse:
3227	17	Djokovic does not earn a penny of Wimbledon prize money. If we all had made the selfish decision to reject the Covid vaccine, as he did, there would be no tennis tournaments anymore. He has not given any respect to his competitors and tennis fans.

He showed his fellow competitors and tennis fans no respect at all.— Benjamin Butterworth (@benjaminbutter) July 10, 2022
3227	21	However, a recently published study, which was carried out as a systematic review of the collected research results, provides another contradiction to the 95-100% rates, the urge to endless oppressions, and the false sense of superiority by unsustainable commentators like Butterworth.
3227	23	While many COVID restrictions have gone away in recent months, numerous companies and universities continue to force a vaccine obligation for re-establishments or students.
3227	25	Despite the clear and consistent evidence that the vaccines do not prevent the spread of the virus, the governments strongly refuse to change their course in the vaccine regulations.
3227	27	Whether from the desire not to have to admit that they’ve made a mistake, or from the deliberately neglect of reality – these harmful actions have continued to affect tens of millions of people.
3227	29	While many of the effectiveness estimates are based on variants that have long been replaced, a new pre-publishing with a systematic review and secondary data analysis carried out by Italian researchers has tried to scientifically measure the effectiveness of the vaccines against omicron.
3227	31	Many have eventually assumed that the two-dose vaccine no longer protects against symptomatic infection, but claim that the upgrading vaccines “fill” the antibodies formed by the first series.
3227	33	In December 2021, Dr. Fauci claimed that infection vaccines were 75% effective in preventing the symptoms of an infection with the Omicron variant.
3227	35	Probably, Fauc's claims and the CDC's recommendations have led to the prescription of vaccines from employers and universities.
3227	37	But as with almost everything he said, Fauci was completely and hopelessly wrong.
3227	39	Far from the 95-100% of the study data by Pfizer or the 75% estimate by Dr. Fauci, the results of the study indicate the vaccine’s effectiveness of less than 20% against infection and less than 25% against symptomatic diseases after just a few months:
3227	41	“We found a clear immune escape associated with omicron infections and symptomatic diseases, both after taking two and three doses. The half-life of protection against symptomatic infection by two doses was estimated for Delta to 178 to 456 days and for Omikron to 66 to 73 days. It has been found that refrigeration doses restore the VE to a level that is comparable to that which was achieved shortly after the second dose was given; however, a rapid decline of the VE of the refrigeration dose against Omikron was observed, with less than 20% VE against infection and less than 25% VE against symptomatic disease 9 months after the refrigeration dose.
3227	43	It is important to note that the FDA has established a 50% effectiveness in the prevention of the disease as a threshold for the approval of COVID vaccines.
3227	45	However, the results of the studies indicate that “six months after the second dose of each vaccination has less than 13% effectiveness against a symptomatic Omikron infection.”
3227	47	Not only does the initial two-dose vaccination not be able to maintain approximately 50% against omicron, but the refreshing dose, which, according to Fauci, serves to “ keep people healthy”, quickly leaves half of this percentage against symptomatic diseases.
3227	49	It is remarkable that the review of the evidence excluded studies in which antibodies were measured to calculate effectiveness as the FDA has approved the vaccines for small children on the basis of antibodies production:
3227	51	The supervisory authorities allowed the vaccine manufacturers to conclude on the effectiveness by demonstrating that the vaccines can produce similar antibody levels as they act protective in adolescents and young adults, a concept known as immunobridging. This has helped to accelerate the attempts.
3227	53	Rather than the FDA desperately hoped that the antibodies levels would lead to high effectiveness rates, this study shows the exact opposite.
3227	55	It should also be remembered that Moderna originally claimed that its vaccines were “100% effective” in teenagers, and Fauci said in an interview that they were “practically 100% effective”.
3227	57	In view of this new study, it is impossible to justify vaccines for healthy students or workers with the argument “protection of the health and well-being of others”.
3227	59	There is little or no protection against an infection with the dominant variants and there is no protection against symptoms.
3227	61	It’s not even the only omicron with which the vaccines have problems. Also against Delta the effectiveness dropped rapidly and dramatically:
3227	63	The vaccine of Pfizer fell to ~50% efficacy against Delta after just a few months.
3227	65	The tremendous decline in the effectiveness of Omikron was also not captured by infusion vaccines. Neither Pfizer nor Modern were able to stop the decline or a significantly higher protection rate:
3227	67	What does the Biden government do with all these research results?
3227	69	It urges everyone to receive another vaccine.
3227	71	A new report from the Washington Post shows that “Biden officials” are urging to introduce the second vaccination for all adults, not only for the group of over the age of 50, to which they are currently targeting:
3227	73	What is the response to the rapid decline in effectiveness against the dominant variants after the first upgrading? Of course a second shock.
3227	75	The first paragraph of the article points to the current role of the FDA and the CDC as officials who are intended to mark everything that the president’s handlangers want:
3227	77	Biden administration officials are developing a plan to enable all adults to receive a second coronavirus vaccine, subject to the consent of the federal authorities.
3227	79	If you disclose your plan through indiscretion to the press before the federal authorities have officially recommended it, it shows how confident you are that the political pressure will overcome any despair by the authorities.
3227	81	If you know that the FDA and the CDC will do what is told to them, you can announce your base that they will soon receive the second vaccination. Does it play a role that your vaccination and the first vaccination did not preserve you from a COVID disease? No, of course not!
3227	83	But don't worry, Ashish Jha and Anthony Fauci support the project:
3227	85	Although the plan is still to be formally blessed by the supervisory authorities and public health officials, it has the support of the Coronavirus Coordinator of the White House, Ashish Jha, and Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top expert on infectious diseases.
3227	87	The same Fauci, who hopelessly overestimated the effectiveness of the first refrigeration dose, now advocates the introduction of a second refrigeration dose, which will also quickly decline from a already disappointing level.
3227	89	If what you do doesn’t work, you just do more of it.
3227	91	A relatively reasonable vaccine expert even stated that this strategy is not really meaningful, as COVID will never disappear and the vaccines are unable to provide a significant protection against moderate diseases:
3227	93	I think it’s meaningful for certain groups, but a universal outbreak strategy makes no sense,” Offit said in an interview on Monday and quoted data that show that three doses of the mRNA vaccine provide a lasting protection against severe diseases. “At some point we have to get used to the fact that mild and moderate diseases are part of this virus that will accompany us for the rest of my life, for the rest of my children’s life and for the rest of their children’s life.”
3227	95	Offit even warned that this strategy could lead to significant negative consequences and further reject vaccination efforts:
3227	97	Offit also warned that repeated administration of the same vaccine could lead to a phenomenon known as “imprinting” in which the human immune system develops a very targeted response to earlier versions of a virus and does not adapt when the virus develops. “If there should ever be a virus that is truly resistant to the protection from severe diseases, you have to start from the forefront and give this vaccine.
3227	99	Will Fauci, Jha, Walensky and the other alleged “experts” be concerned about it? No, of course not! To do this, they must admit that they’ve made a mistake and abstain from their endless COVID policy.
3227	101	Everything that weaken its power and influence is not an acceptable solution, and thus the inevitable pressure on the fourth vaccination will increase despite the lack of utility and potential damage.
3227	103	Of course, in the U.S. despite the declining protection by the vaccination, there are increasingly more cases, while the number of deaths remains low:
3227	105	This raises the important question why all this is necessary at all.
3227	107	We have already seen that extremely high vaccine rates and vaccines are not enough to prevent the number of deaths from rising to a record level in a specific geographical area:
3227	109	Also, they did not stop some countries from reporting that 56% of their entire population was positively tested:
3227	111	What does it mean to force additional vaccines? Is the next vaccination also prescribed on the basis of antibodies that do not correlate with the protection?
3227	113	This is a ridiculous standard that will only lead to further division and uncertainty to public health.
3227	115	The actual effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron is less than 25 percent, according to new studies.
3227	117	So what will the FDA, the CDC and the Biden Administration begin with this information? They add another booster.
3227	119	Even if the number of deaths is low despite significant cases that are already too low due to home tests, they cannot refrain from giving further vaccines instead of simply admit that they have been wrong.
3227	121	It’s an irresistible pursuit of increasing power and control, rather than simply moving forward with life and accepting an endemic virus that is mutated and will continue to mutate.
3227	123	The government has already signaled that the regulatory authorities should follow their plan, so that the decision is basically a reasonable matter.
3227	125	At the question of the justification for the introduction of a fourth dose for younger Americans, the post that CDC officials said: “There is no US data for people under 50.”
3227	127	The European CDC agrees to:
3227	129	These can be administered at least four months after the last vaccination, with a focus on people who have received an infusion more than six months ago. The currently approved vaccines continue to be highly effective in reducing #COVID19 hospitalizations, severe diseases and deaths.
3228	1	Continue so...?
3228	3	During the pandemic course, it is apparent that no useful evaluable data has been collected in Germany. Neither under Spahn nor under Lauterbach. A testimony of poverty. On what basis the policy is going to continue. Should the Infection Protection Act be renewed if the previous measures have not been evaluated and their effectiveness has not been scientifically comprehensive? And what measures should that be? by Michael Fitz.
3228	5	This post is also available as an audio podcast.
3228	7	The applicable Infection Protection Act clearly and clearly regulates that before a newly published The extension of this law, which is already discussed and prepared interministerial, the effectiveness or inefficiency of the measures prescribed in the past two years to combat the Corona pandemic, must be scientifically evaluated. This is only consequent, because most of these measures were accompanied by an unprecedented limitation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens in this country. Freedom of movement, physical impairment, freedom of assembly, free choice of profession – to mention only the most important.
3228	9	Now, after more than a year of voluntary work on this, this evaluative study is present. Their content is a catastrophic testimony to the responsible in the government and former government. And not just that. It is already concerned with the composition of the Commission, which has not been attributed sufficient scientific expertise in key areas. No children's psychologists, too few epidemiologists, no educational scientists, etc. And above all, too little independent scientists and too much to many, who in any case, long-known, come from the blase of the “consultors” of the Ministry of Health and the RKI and other government-owned institutions, although Mr. Professor Drosten, the probably most prominent among them, for whatever reason, had emerged at the very beginning. The Commission was underoccupied, it worked under a huge time pressure and on the basis of an unavailable database.
3228	11	As expected, this scandal is downloaded and relativized by most main media.
3228	13	This is the foundation for a further action against a new epidemiological emergency of national scope, which is not present but is expected in the autumn, but is already medially reluctant.
3228	15	How should this go without sufficiently collected data and reliable numbers of all aspects of the epidemic? This question is now apparently right by some political prominents from the Ampel coalition.
3228	17	For example, Mr. Göring-Eckardt of the Greens asks himself: What should we begin with such a study? After two years of pandemic we know exactly what works and what doesn’t. Oh yeah? The opposite is the case. Until today, and even after reading the study, we still don’t know how much lockdowns, distance rules, access restrictions or occupational ban after 2G or 3G, school closures or vaccination for many people have any effect, and if so, what they have on the spread of the Corona virus in all its mutations, now converted to the “light influenza virus”.
3228	19	All the kidnapping instruments created for the benefit of the public health, which, above all, our children, and not just them, have fallen into mental and physical exceptions, and have also taken care of and will ensure that all the harm of freelancers, solitary self-employed and businessmen are close to the financial ruin. People who didn’t live badly before Corona and paid taxes. The current poverty report of the Parity Welfare Association speaks links in this regard and clearly shows what ruins the Corona actions in our society and the previous federal government have already left and will surely be left.
3228	21	Lanz asked the present health minister in his 5th of July 2022, with his permanent, but in the case right to show, in a video column, why the evaluation committee would not have been extended by the apparently missing expert staff, that would have been possible. Surprisingly, he didn’t ask why there are no data or too little. Lauterbach pushes it to the predecessor, who had called the Commission and could have taken care of it. So simple is that!
3228	23	If I had a bicycle chain. The predecessor got it, not me. And no, Lanz doesn’t do the nearest, no, he doesn’t keep here. This distinguishes the Talkmaster from the committed journalist. Sorry, the opportunity is missed. He also doesn’t ask why Lauterbach, at least immediately after his office, did not do the same. It is also unfortunate, because we all knew more precisely now that neither he nor his predecessor Spahn might have and never had a real interest in a truly scientific and above all independent evaluation of the responsible government measures against Corona.
3228	25	Then the gentlemen and a number of other cabinet and countryside colleagues might have to admit that they have undergone grave mistakes in all the activism, which one should then admit. But to admit errors, that has long been no longer en vogue in politics! Or even to apologize to the voters, for example. with the angry limited and diffamated non-vaccinations.
3228	27	Well, the study has proven the mistake that during the pandemic history in Germany obviously no useful evaluable data was collected. Neither under Spahn nor under Lauterbach. A poverty certificate for the ministers themselves and also the German health authorities assigned to them. We still don’t know how many people actually – vaccinated or unvaccinated – have died of Corona or not. We still don’t know exactly how much damage, apart from the benefit, has been caused by vaccination with mRNA vaccines in the form of all kinds of unpleasant and partially massive side effects. We still don’t know how many people are tested or have been tested to calculate the daily incidence that appears to be the basis of all decisions, assumptions and fears, even though the hospitalization rate has long been agreed as a new magic number.
3228	29	According to the DIVI Register, on 7 July 2022, 1044 cases of corona are in intensive treatment throughout the country, of which 328 have been treated. There are currently 23,823 intensive beds available throughout the country, which, as in the last months – whether the Corona Wave or not – are always over 80 percent, already for economic reasons alone.
3228	31	There are currently a reservation of 8,545 emergency beds.
3228	33	According to the DKG report (Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft) on 6 July 2022, 12.095 COVID-tested patients were hospitalized in normal beds and 1.045 COVID patients were hospitalized at an intensive station. The total number of hospitalized COVID patients is approximately 6.3 promiles of the total population. So far the facts. With what mathematical art grid a hospitalization rate is calculated here from 5 to 5.7 percent and with what reference size, maybe a specialist can explain to me at any time... you are learning willing.
3228	35	Whatever the way. On what basis will our Minister of Health, our policy, and our elected people want the progress or progress. Should the Infection Protection Act be renewed if the previous measures have not been evaluated and their effectiveness has not been scientifically comprehensive? And what measures should that be? It has to go quickly, and it has to go quickly, says the panic minister. What international epidemiological studies or data models do Mr. Lauterbach tell all the news about new, dangerous viral mutants and possible pandemic developments that will lead him to permanently threaten us a whole, very bad Corona autumn/winter 2022/23? And what happens then? Well, of course, continue as it was, because we already know what works or doesn’t work, according to Mrs. Göring-Eckardt.
3228	37	What should it be: Who needs fundamental rights, if we can freeze solidarely for Ukraine in the coming winter.
3229	1	It is poison! Covid injections affected half (42%) of women’s menstrual cycles (updated)
3229	3	Can you imagine that another product with the side effects of excess bleeding, of which 42% of menstruating women are affected, is allowed on the market?
3229	5	They poison women.
3229	7	And men have a reduced number of sperm.
3229	9	And yet Dr. Fauci, the CDC and Big Pharma still promote these poisons.
3229	11	The latest study on the COVID vaccines found that half of the menstrual cycles were affected by women.
3229	13	In a new study from the University of Washington it was found that the COVID-19 vaccine affects the menstrual cycle of about 42 percent of women.In the study, which should reveal reports of unusual menstrual bleeding after a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, more than 39,129 adults were surveyed online after they were double vaccinated against the virus.
3229	15	It was found that 42 percent of people with a regular menstrual cycle after vaccination had stronger regular bleeding than before.In addition, it was found that some people who normally do not have menstruation, such as. B. Persons who took long-acting reversible contraceptives or gender-like hormones and persons who were in menopause blood clot.
3229	17	For the first time in April 2021, we tens of thousands of women who complained of irregular menstruation after taking the COVID vaccines.
3229	19	Researchers investigate the connection between COVID and menstruation after thousands of women changes in their cycle after vaccination with coronavirus.
3229	21	Thousands of women have changes in their monthly cycle after taking the COVID vaccine.Anne Thompson received her first dose of the vaccine from Pfizer on 12. April, that is, the day that should have been the last day of their period.
3229	23	“I had all the time about blurry. And now, two weeks after vaccination, I think it was three days ago, I got my period again,” Thompson said.His next period came one and a half weeks too early, which caused Thompson to ask whether the vaccine had somehow affected his menstrual cycle.
3229	25	This question was also asked by the researcher Katherine Lee, according to her own experience.‘I had smell bleeding, although I usually have no menstrual symptoms because I wear the Mirena spiral,’ said Lee, a doctorate scientist at the Department of Public Health at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
3229	27	Lee addressed Kate Clancy, an extraordinary professor of Anthropology at the University of Illinois, who subsequently posted a tweet about it. February sent, and I still receive every minute 20 more notifications that deal with this topic in any form,” Clancy said.
3229	29	The overwhelming resonance caused the researchers to create a survey they published on social media. A total of 59,000 people started the survey and described different experiences.‘The participants report differences in the timing of their cycle,’ says Lee. “Some people report a much easier period, others report a much stronger period.
3229	31	Clancy said the researchers had also heard of bleeding and melting in women after menopause.A woman sent an email to Lauren Petty from NBC 5 and said she has been in menopause for nine years. She received her first dose of Pfizer in March, began to bleed at night, and it lasted 10 days.
3229	33	“Honestly, not many of my patients have complained about irregularities during their menstruation,” said Dr. Elizabeth Yepez, a gynecologist at the Rush University Medical Center.
3229	35	It’s now a year ago that the scientific community has this side effect of the vaccine.
323	1	How the “pandemic” has set the way for the new fascism of the global state of biosafety
323	3	We live – so it is repeatedly said to us – in “unprecedented times” in which “unprecedented circumstances” require “unprecedented measures” for which there is no historical precedent and because of which – so the unprecedented consequence – the powers cannot be brought to responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Without an example, however, it is one of those words that the alarm clocks should sound, because it implies that we are in a moment about which history cannot teach us anything. History teaches us that we should always be suspicious when the rulers claim that we are in a moment about which history can tell us nothing. The call to forget the past always occurs in the service of power; but there are very few things that history cannot teach us. There was once a time when we studied history just for this reason to learn from it, rather than to survive without memory in the seemingly unprecedented news of the present. Whether this present is a product of ignorance or deception, the past has inevitably a lot to tell us about allegedly “unprecedented” moments, and so is it with the “crisis” of the coronavirus.
323	5	In the two years between March 2020, when the World Health Organization officially announced the “Pandemia” and the British Parliament approved the Coronavirus Act 2020, and March 2022, when the date for the Coronavirus Act was reached and the last of the 582 law-based coronavirus regulations was repealed, we are now, six months later, in a renewal of that “false war” which extended for eight months between the Britain’s war declaration to Germany in September 1939 and the German invasion to France in May 1940. With the abolition of the thousands of regulations that ruled our lives for two years, the understandable desire to believe that the coronavirus ‘crisis’ has passed and we will return to a kind of ‘new’ normality. However, as new crises have come to their place – the war in Ukraine, the apes, the so-called “livecost crisis” and the return of the environmental crisis – it becomes more and more difficult to see the “abbreviation solution” not only as the first campaign in a war that has not been declared by any government, but therefore is not less real. This war, led by the international technocraties of the Global Governance, which has gained more and more power over our lives since March 2020 under the “pandemic” coverage, is not against foreign countries, but against the populations of their Member States. The weapons of this war, whose compliance is tested under coverage, are the digital identity, the digital currency of the central bank, the universal basic income, the social credit, the environmental, social and governance criteria (ESG), the Sustainable Development Goals and all the other programs that contribute to the United Nations Agenda 2030. If not yet, they are likely to be launched in a flash war campaign, possibly this winter, when the World Health Organization advises European countries to reintroduce the masking and vaccination obligation. Just like in the winter of 1939-1940, it is now the time of the storm.
323	7	However, my comparison with the beginning of the Second World War is not just an analogy. I am not the only one who is convinced that the willingness of our governments, during the “pandemic” to use the state power against our own people, with the reason to protect us from ourselves, signals a new stage of authority – and something like the return of fascism – in the government, legal and cultural forms of the former neoliberal democracies of the West, and one of the objectives of my book is to investigate the validity of this thesis. However, I am not concerned with an academic question of the significance and historicity of the term “fascism”, but rather with the question of how and why the general and widespread moral collapse in the West since March 2020 – another indicator of fascism – came so quickly and easily, and with the question of what purposes this moral collapse is used. I think here the story can tell us something about these allegedly “unprecedented” circumstances and actions.
323	9	Something but not everything. For during the historic fascism that emerged in the context of the imperialism of the European national states and their struggle for power, this struggle, a hundred years later, has reduced itself to the unified and practically irreversible “introduction” of the programs, technologies and regulations of what was celebrated as the fourth industrial revolution. And while our economic, security and military allies divide the globe into new geopolitical influences, in the West – I mean Europe, North America and Australia – there is no war between national states, but a civil war that is against our institutions of democratic government and the power division between executive, legislative and judicial. To the extent that these institutions and this power division are destroyed and replaced by the rule of international technocrates, which consist of the headquarters of private enterprises and the unelected representatives of national governments, this “war” represents, more precisely, a revolution of Western capitalism against the neoliberalism under which we have lived in the last 40 years. What it goes beyond, and the conclusion I try to draw with my thesis about fascism, is the new totalitarism of the global state of biosecurity.
323	11	This book was 18 months ahead of research and writing between March 2020 and October 2021, in which I published more than two dozen articles about the Coronavirus ‘Crisis’. When I started writing this book in February 2022, which I had designed rather as a single work than a collection of articles, I came out of the most important conclusions I had come to in this research. Although many others have come to the same or similar conclusions, these are still in sharp opposition to the official representation of the coronavirus ‘crisis’ that many still believe or at least follow. However, it is not necessary that the reader accepts each of these conclusions in order to draw some benefit from this work. Part of the goal of this study is to sketch the greater context in which we can understand how what has been conceivably rejected for two years as “disruption theories” now represents the reality in which our immediate future will develop at a scary speed and endfulness. The question that we are facing now is not the question of doubt or faith in the reality around us, but how we can face it before we fall into the new totalitarianism.
323	13	Since the abolition of the rules justified by the coronavirus in the UK, a large part of the resistance to the various bio-security programs and technologies has been exhausted in questioning the justification for the abductions and showing the harmful and fatal effects of the vaccine program. And although this work is valuable and important – especially when it comes to stoping the criminal injection and indoctrination of young people – it was accompanied by a refusal to deal with what these programs have prepared our compliance for the next stage of the global biosecurity state. Although these programs are carried out with the various reasons for convenient access and freedom of movement within the global biosafety state, national security against current and future biological, cyber or military threats, which are now all summarized under the motto “terrorists” and of course with the great environmental motto “save the planet” from global warming, they will be carried out outside any immediate threat, as it represents the Coronavirus “pandemic” and may be expected to have a less monitoring than those that are subject to the restrictions of our human rights and freedoms. That’s why they’re likely to be implemented quickly and at once, with our biometric data making the digital identity a condition for numerous freedoms, cash pulled out of circulation and replaced by a digital currency controlled and programmed by the central banks, and a social credit system monitored by artificial intelligence and controlled by face recognition technology will be a reality in which one day we will wake up and have no choice but to add or lose our access to civil rights standard.
323	15	In this context, I wrote my book, which is neither an academic study of the history of fascism nor a journalistic report of the past two and a half years, but a work of political theory. Some of the chapters are based on the works of other authors on various aspects of fascism and totalitarianism, including the Italian semiotic and cultural critic Umberto Eco, the Italian critical theorist Fabio Vighi, the French sociologist and philosopher Georges Bataille, the German literary critic Walter Benjamin, the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, the English romancier and journalist George Orwell, the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben and the German political theorist Hannah Arendt. And although the book was written rather for a popular than for a scientific reader, I did not fail to address the political, legal, economic, cultural, philosophical, psychological and moral questions that the global state of biosecurity raises. The positive resonance to my articles that predicted this study has strengthened me in the assumption that there is a greater readership in the UK for this type of analysis than it wants to make us believe our rigorous anti-intellectual culture. In this regard, I hope that my book will provide a more historical and practical framework to understand and respond to the past two and a half years than the vituperative, sectierist, autoritarian and politically naive debates that are conducted in parliament, mainstream media or on social media platforms.
323	17	As readers who are familiar with the work of Hayek know, my title is taken from his enormous influential book The Road to Serfdom, published in 1944 during World War II in the UK. Hayek sought to reject the Marxist argument that fascism is the reaction of a falling capitalism to the growing threat by socialism, and argued that Italian fascism, German national-socialism and Soviet communism had all common roots in the central economic planning and the resulting power of the state over the individual. He therefore opposed that Britain follows the model of socialism that was presented in the very popular Beveridge report in 1942 and that the post-war Labour government would not fully implement with the creation of the well-being state. Thus he also put the foundation for the neoliberal revolution in the late 1970s, which conquered the West and brought us to this point. Thus, although I do not share Hayek’s equalization of fascism with socialism, nor his entrance to liberalism and capitalism as defenders of the rights of the individual – both have been rejected by the return of fascism into the political, legal and cultural forms of the most advanced capitalist economies in the past two and a half years – Hayek’s fears and warnings about the threat of the individual freedom by the state are today even more current than 80 years ago. If 350 million Europeans lived under fascist governments for a decade and longer, as Hayek wrote, how should we then describe the digital property to which the global state of biosecurity condemns the more than 900 million people living today in the former neoliberal democracies of the West? So under the banner of this warning I publish The Road to Fascism.
3230	1	Italy and France: “Dracron” over Europe
3230	3	The duo Mario Draghi and Emmanuel Macron threaten to dissolve the German-French tandem. The trend was long to be seen. The fact that Germany’s position in the EU is eroded is Merkel’s foreign policy heritage.
3230	5	Since last year, a double-headed chemistry has been driving its unbeat in Europe. It is the successor of Merkozy. Once French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were considered the most famous signs of European policy, deep changes are now announcing. The duo of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and French President Emmanuel Macron received the title “Dracron” last year. Already in September of last year, the Mirror used the term for the duo from the two largest Roman countries. Focus and the world took over the word creation just a few days later.
3230	7	The Financial Times had previously arranged similar sounds. On the weekend, the Deutsche Welle took the topic and pointed out that the term is now circulating in the French and Italian media. In Italy, again, the Libero showed the contribution of the DW as a sign that in Berlin, it is obvious that one is afraid of his own position. While the DW claims that the present appearance cannot replace the German-French tandem, doubts are quite appropriate at this point. Because unlike the media suggests, the power-political turn of time in European foreign policy does not date to the resignation of Merkel. She is prepared for a long time. Because it was the chancellor himself who brought the stone into the role. Earlier in the financial and Eurocrisis, the contradiction was responsible for bringing France and Germany into responsibility, Paris and Berlin united – although the two countries had strongly differentiated interests.
3230	9	“Dracron” is a creation by Angela Merkel.
3230	11	On Sarkozy, who, despite his weaknesses, gave an important vote to France in the European power concert, followed François Hollande. He was a lucky fall for the German position. Although France continued to have strong networks and influential personalities in Brussels, Hollande himself proved to be a weak figure. The passivity of France is clear only from the retrospective, you can see the numerous incidents of its successor. The accents put Hollande just a few.
3230	13	The 2015 migration crisis raised Germany as its “theme” itself, instead of providing assistance to the threatened Greeks and Hungarians and sustainably supporting them in the border protection. Instead, Merkel explained the problem to the main issue. The result: Germany as a magnet for migration flows, broken table silver with EU partners, and the existing image of a Schlaraffenland that prefers to shift the fault to Athens, Rome, Madrid or Warsaw, rather than to turn off the Pull factors that it attracts the burdened and intimidated people from all over the world.
3230	15	The leadership of other EU countries in the Causa is unforgettable so far. Berlin believed that with its moralizing migration policy it has won the hearts of the world – the media claim to this until today – while the majority of Europeans were shocked by the wankelability and willfulness of the giant in the heart of the continent.
3230	17	Brexit means the end of German dominance in the EU policy
3230	19	Causal is caused by this is Merkel’s next weakness: the Brexit 2016, in which for many British the German attitude and policy in 2015 was a background, which significantly determined the EU policy in this area. The fact that the German media and politicians also participated in the misconduct is not a secret. It will remain a mystery for later historians how the German federal government has been trying for years with billions of money to keep the small Greece in the EU and to save it under all circumstances, but it has been a hole around the significant Albion, which was financially and European-politically crucial to continue to maintain the German position in key areas.
3230	21	With the self-duty goodbye of the British from the EU, Merkel had placed the failure stone for the fall of the German and the rise of Latin dominance. With the strengthening of the Romanic impulse and the exclusion of the Anglo-Saxon, the mentality had necessarily changed. In the hard political currency it means majority for the debt union, the irreversibility of the soft euro and the centralization into a bureaucratic empire. In the years 2017-2021, only the hidden armor that concealed Merkel’s building was scattered.
3230	23	Despite monetary policy: Italy and France are not natural allies
3230	25	For Macron, the German map was in the first place the thinner because in 2017 in Italy came a government from the Five-Star Movement and the League, which also put significantly stronger accents in Europe and inscenated itself as a counterpol to Paris. From a European perspective, the years 2017 to 2019 were already painted in French-Italy, though rather as opponents rather than allies. Berlin has taken it back in the past few years of Merkel’s era. In the foreign countries, the physical departure of the Chancellor was not hidden.
3230	27	The opponents of the new Tandem can only hope for Italy's instability
3230	29	Although in Germany the reductionist view prevails, the financial policy considerations should make Italy in principle an ally of France, there is still a conditional rivalry – more kindly, a competition – between the two Roman nations. In the Mediterranean policy, both countries have differentiated interests. Rome accuses Paris so far of deliberately advancing the bombing of Libya, which not only led to the end of Italian influence in Tripolis, but also has a rain-to-day migration shift to the peninsula. For the “populist government” the real opponent was not in Berlin, but in Paris, which was already then perceived as the dominant force in Brussels. For Germany, the sharp rivalry, on the contrary, brought a waste break, which, however, only delayed the inevitable.
3230	31	After Draghi, Berlin and Paris could be even more unpleasant.
3230	33	The only thing the opponents of the new French-Italian Tandem can speculate on is the notorious instability of the governments in Rome. With Draghi, Italy currently offers a well-connected head of government, which has a weight in international interests. But Draghi’s term expires in spring 2023 – and the chances that he will be re-elected or re-elected. Candidates appear little.
3230	35	However, if the ambitious Giorgia Meloni of the Fratelli d’Italia succeeded in converting their current strong survey values into parliamentary seats, and Matteo Salvini as Silvio Berlusconi gained the required majority – a victory of the right camp is stated by the surveys since 2019 continuously, with only variable values for the different parties of the alliance – then there would be completely different problems for Berlin and Paris. Against the legally distorted national populists (or whatever terms you can imagine for them), Germany and France could then get closer together. However, the German-French Tandem is then faced by a coalition from Rome, Warsaw and Budapest. Merkel's heritage in the EU policy makes it possible.
3231	1	How the Prosecutor’s Office and the Media Jointly Combat Reason: Legalization in the Struggle Against the Opposition?
3231	3	"The Duden defines the word “righteousness” as follows: “In the decision of a case in office committed crime of intentionally misuse of law or of falsification of facts in favor or in the disadvantage of a party.” The Prosecutor's Office of Munich is now investigating against the AfD deputy Petr Bystron. According to the investigators, he has shown Hitler’s grace. The Bundestag has also abolished Bystron’s immunity. This is by the investigative journalist Boris Reitschuster on ""Reitschuster.de""."
3231	5	The politician is a native Czech who was arrested by state security at the age of 15 and later received political asylum in the Federal Republic. From 2006 to 2013 he was a member of the FDP.
3231	7	It doesn’t matter how you stand to AfD and Bystron. I personally, like all politicians, stand against them critically, but at the same time condemn the witch hunt that takes place in Germany against the party and its politicians.
3231	9	A look at the video of the event – part of a federal protest day of the AfD against the vaccination obligation on 5. March – and the point on which the alleged Hitler grace was shown shows that the accusations of the Munich Prosecutor’s Office – one of the policy-based authorities – are simply absurd. The question is here: can the officials really be so wrong in their assessment, or is there a deliberately false application of the law—as the Dude defines the ‘righteousness’?
3231	11	Make yourself a picture:
3231	13	Winning game: Whoever sees a #Hitlergruß here wins a stage at the Prosecutor's Office of Munich I, in the office of the group leader #Diplich. #Immunity lifting.https://t.co/btsljD3RUG—  s (@PetrBystronAfD) July 9, 2022
3231	15	And now please compare the scene with other political images:
3231	17	Petr Bystron must be charged in court for an elevated arm as part of a speech. — Erika Steinbach (@SteinbachErika) July 9, 2022
3231	19	The others not.
3231	21	So, dear people, whoever is not in the AfD may raise the arm.
3231	23	Whoever is in the AfD, this gesture should be interpreted as a criminal act. Untoldly! pic.twitter.com/wO16F68UEa
3231	25	It is much more likely that Lauterbach has shown a Hitler grace than a liberal like Bystron. The usual horse against opposition politicians in a democracy https://t.co/BkvmuUP8nh https://t.co/gHh4WI8CfH pic.twitter.com/1JhbRPNP0w— @Swingtanz banned - 'I understood what I mean?!' (@Swingtanz) July 9, 2022
3231	27	"The Bayerische Rundfunk writes: “With a speech at an AfD conference at the Münchner Königsplatz ‘the Deputy Bystron was aware of the words ‘We are the AfD’ throwing his right arm towards the participants of the protest,’ explained Supreme Court lawyer Anne Leiding. This could represent a prohibited Hitler's grace according to the Criminal Code."""
3231	29	Prosecutors who are doing this would probably have had a blinking career in the respective judicial system at other times and in other systems. Supreme Prosecutor Leiding is only the spokeswoman of the prosecutor’s authority and not the competent officer for this case. Nevertheless, the promise with which it appears in the public is remarkable: “We must defend the rule of law every day” (see here).
3231	31	Bystron said it was “evident” that he had not shown Hitler’s grace. He speaks of a “politically instrumentalized prosecutor’s office that has completely lost its neutrality.” The opposition will be “uppressed by the procedures that are entirely attracted to the hair.”
3231	33	The accusation is in the country, the signs with “Bystron” and “Hitlergruß” will remain hanging – no matter what comes out in the end. Faithful to the motto: If you only swallow enough with extract, something remains hanging. Even if you, like the “spiegel” after a destroying title in the pre-spane cautiously scream: “But the case is all other than obvious.”
3231	35	I know very well how unpopular one becomes when defending the AfD or its politicians, and how it is immediately used to frame one into a certain corner. But obvious injustice is something that, as a person with a sense of justice, in any case, has to raise the voice. What the Prosecutor’s Office in Munich does here is a serious damage to the rule of law and democracy. What in the “best Germany of all time” but unfortunately seems to be less an exception than rather the rule.
3231	37	That the Bundestag contributes to this farce and removes the immunity of the colleague because of obviously unlawful accusations, that apparently any even so absurd means is right to diffamate government critics as “Nazi” will be one of the many phenomena in today’s Germany, which has to develop a future management of the past.”
3232	1	The weakening riese
3232	3	Russia's attack on Ukraine has caused tens of thousands of victims, destroyed entire cities and triggered a huge refugee crisis. In Germany, he was also a shocking awakening call for politics and has shocked a decades-long pacifist thinking that had forgotten the classic proverb “Si vis pacem, para bellum”: If you want peace, prepare for war.
3232	5	Comfortable in the shadow of world politics
3232	7	For many years, Germany has made itself comfortable in the windshadow of world policy and hid behind the defence capabilities of others. The largest industrial power in Europe may be an economic rise, but the Bundeswehr has been underfinanced and managed miserably for decades. Most of their equipment, including fighter aircraft, ships and tanks, is not ready for use and the morality of the troops is shrinking.
3232	9	"In the morning of the Russian massacre, the inspector of the army, General Alphon Mais, said that our armed forces are “white” there and are “not able to fulfill our obligations to our allies.” On the question whether the Bundeswehr is able to defend Germany, General A.D. Egon Ramms, formerly top German officer at NATO, replied: “Short answer: No.” On the morning of the Russian attack, Merkel's last defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, said in tears: ""I'm so angry on us because we've historically failed."""
3232	11	There is not much left of the Prussian military spirit.
3232	13	A change in defence policy has long been overwhelming – but for many years it has been blocked by a fearful, deeply anti-military public mood. A profound change in national mentality has long been necessary, but it is, of course, easier to say than to do. In the period after 1945 all the traces of the ancient Prussian military spirit disappeared largely.
3232	15	The western German elites changed fundamentally and defined themselves so liberal and post-national that they even began to teach other nations about disarmament and at the same time threw the whole idea of the national state on board and believed that they could dissolve the nations in an increasingly integrated EU. This is still the dominant way of thinking of the “opened”, “progressive” voters, all of them the supporters of the Greens and the SPD.
3232	17	Aggressive course of Russia has been ignored for years
3232	19	The political class had long before the collapse of the Soviet Empire 1989–1990 hoped for the “end of (German) history”. Islamist attacks like the 11th. When September met the West, their representatives decided to get out of history and the “cultural struggle”. For years, the aggressive course of Russia under Putin has been ignored. We should therefore be very skeptical when SPD chancellor Olaf Scholz promised a fundamental change overnight.
3232	21	Scholz called the Russian attack on Ukraine a turn of time. Without warning the Greens or even his own party, he announced an additional €100 billion for the armed forces in the form of a special asset. However, it is doubtful that this money is used to improve military capabilities that have been chronically underfinanced since 1991, the last year in which Germany spent the NATO partners expected annual 2% of GDP for defence. The number for 2020 was at the lowest 1.4% and even that was a significant increase compared to the previous years.
3232	23	Schröder and Merkel made Germany a hostage of Russian resources
3232	25	The small print on the special asset indicates that the funds will be extended over several years. Furthermore, some of it is expected to be outdoors in areas outside the defence, such as development aid and environmental issues – a distraction from the Green Coalition Partner. Before the beginning of the war in Ukraine, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (Greenland) spoke of “feminist foreign policy” – in “progressive” circles a figure for disarmament and development assistance instead of defence policy.
3232	27	Germany has been in an extremely vulnerable situation since the invasion of Ukraine, as it is significantly dependent on energy imports from Russia. More than half of German natural gas needs were supplied by companies like Gazprom, and about a third of oil and a seventh of coal comes from the Russian Federation. Angela Merkel and her SPD predecessor Gerhard Schröder have made the country a hostage of Russian resources. Now Berlin is faced with a sudden Russian gas supply and desperately seeks a replacement.
3232	29	Merkel's energy transition was crazy and threatens Germany
3232	31	The Green Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck prompted demonstrations directly to Qatar, a country that has always hated its party because of its poor human rights situation (especially because of the discrimination against homosexuals). The EU has concluded a costly agreement with the United States on liquid gas supplies to reduce Russian imports. However, these replacement deliveries will only occur slowly and will be available in sufficient amounts not earlier than two years. A complete cessation of Russian gas supplies would trigger a severe recession in Germany, forcing important industries such as the chemical and raw materials industry, steel production and processing industries to stop, and threatening hundreds of thousands of jobs.
3232	33	Germany’s dependence on Russia’s natural gas is the result of a 2011 energy transition overthrown by Merkel, when she, after the disaster in Japan’s Fukushima, has accelerated its withdrawal from nuclear energy without consideration in order to weaken green voters. With the closure of fourteen of the 17 nuclear power plants, the share of nuclear energy in Germany’s power supply has decreased from 25 percent to about 6 percent. As part of the nuclear expansion plan, the remaining three nuclear power plants will be closed by the end of this year. Elon Musk rightly stated it “foolish that Germany is now withdrawing from nuclear energy.” In 2019, Merkel also caused the withdrawal from coal flow. The resulting energy gap should actually be partially closed with gas power plants, which currently cover approximately 15 percent of the power supply.
3232	35	The departure from the nuclear output is overwhelming.
3232	37	Germany is increasingly relying on highly subsidized flat electricity from renewable energies, which has brought the price of electricity to almost the highest level of all industrial countries before the outbreak of the war. No other big industrial country is trying to get out of nuclear energy and coal at the same time. Energy experts warn that it will become more and more difficult to ensure the important basic burden of electricity, and that in the future electricity waste can no longer be excluded. Neighboring countries such as France and the UK have announced plans to build new nuclear power plants, and Belgium has decided to delay the duration of its reactors by ten years. Only Germany, by Greta Thunberg, refuses to lead a serious debate on the overwhelming return to nuclear energy.
3232	39	The country is in a hostage of ignorant red-green ideologists. Merkel's CDU suffered in September 2021 a disturbing election defeat, which made the party practically implod. The FDP is too weak and is not willing to openly oppose the green spirit of time. Only the AfD calls for the withdrawal from the nuclear outlet – but the other parties have predicted it to isolate the AfD behind a Cordon sanitaire and refuse to work with it. Just as in 2015, when the AfD, during the so-called refugee crisis, called Merkel’s questionable “Welcome Culture”.
3232	41	Germany's fixed idea of open borders threatens Europe
3232	43	Merkel’s “Willkommens” signals to all migrants in September 2015 and the generous German social benefits triggered a huge wave of illegal immigration in 2015 and 2016. More than 1.5 million mostly young men, mostly Muslim men from the Middle East and North Africa, fled to Germany. Merkel’s policy of uncontrolled borders destabilized the entire continent and in the last part caused many British to vote for the Brexit.
3232	45	The plans forced by Brussels to move migrants against the will of countries such as Poland and Hungary have worsened the situation. All this deepened the division between Germany and the Eastern European countries, which do not want to share the post-national fixed idea of open borders and continue to decide which immigrants they will allow. In Germany, in spite of moral stupidity and extensive teachings, allegedly prejudiced and retarded Eastern European neighbors are scattered.
3232	47	Through the war in Ukraine, we are now facing a real refugee crisis of a vast scale. In particular countries such as Poland and Hungary provide admirable humanitarian aid. Progressive Germans find it hard to continue to look down on them. But even now, the government, under the influence of left-wing migration liberals and other non-governmental organizations, repeats Merkel’s mistakes by refusing to distinguish between real refugees and illegal migrants.
3232	49	Migrants took advantage of the opportunity of the Ukrainian crisis to enter the EU over the east side. Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser (SPD) rejected such concerns without concern and explained, “It doesn’t come to the break.” Suddenly several thousand Africans and Arabs came from Ukraine, who hardly spoke English, no matter Ukrainian, and spent as students. Police reports violent evacuations in refugees houses between low-European immigrants and large families from Roma communities who had displaced themselves as Ukrainian refugees.
3232	51	Goodbye to the Hippie State of the Germans
3232	53	There is no honest debate about who we should help and how we can control immigration. In 2015, British political scientist Anthony Glees compared Germany to a “hippie state that is led only by feelings.” Even now there is too much emotional overwhelming and a complete lack of strategic thinking. Germany is still fighting with Merkel's inheritance of uncontrolled mass immigration. The integration of a large number of uneducated, uneducated migrants from Arab and African countries has failed. More than six years after the massive flow, for example, two-thirds of the Syrians still live from state benefits, and the violence crime has increased. But the problem is even deeper.
3232	55	Since the arrival of Turkish immigrants in the 1960s, Berlin and the major cities in the West have been facing enormous integration problems, like the increasing share of students who do not master German. In some classes of Berlin-Kreuzberg or Berlin-Neukölln, up to 90 percent of students don’t speak English enough to get clear in everyday life. Well-being green voters in Berlin-Mitte, who welcome a multicultural society, but give up integration efforts such as the demand to speak German at schools as “forced germanization”, seemingly flee from the firepoint districts to the suburbs as soon as they have children in the school age.
3232	57	Due to a deep-sitting debt complex that is rooted in the crimes of the Third Reich, many Germans argue that their country has – or should have – a protected national identity at all. Former Integration Minister Aydan Özoğuz (SPD) had even once claimed that for her “a specific German culture, beyond the language, is simply unidentifiable.” It is understood by itself that it is difficult for a country that is unclear whether it has its own moral value, cultural peculiarities, or any right to exist, to integrate immigrants and foreigners – unlike a self-conscious nation.
3232	59	Resist to the “Woke” virus and become a self-conscious nation
3232	61	Like other western countries, Germany is also infected with the “Woke” virus, which forces western nations to deny their own history and go into endless self-discovery about actual and imagined historical errors, colonialism, “white domination” and the allegedly discriminatory nature of the traditional family. Two weeks before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, Oliver Dowden, the chairman of the British Conservative Party, warned in a speech in Washington rightly that the occupation with “white” cultural wars destroys the West and undermines its democracies in the face of the threat by authoritarian and dictatorial regimes such as Russia and China. Germany is so blurred by this cultural war that it is practically absent on the world stage – an extremely dangerous state that weakens the entire Western Alliance.
3232	63	For the first time in many decades, German politicians have to learn to think rather than feel – and finally maintain the vital national interests of Germany. They must therefore, as soon as possible, dismiss the scheme of an EU as a substitute country and instead recognize the fact that almost all other Europeans remember to preserve their unique culture, their national identity and their right to democratic self-determination within the framework of national states. German politicians must finally wake up from their suicidal fools and gain a clear sense of reality. Nearly a century after the war, it is time for a voluntary German riese to finally stand up and become an adult country capable of seeing the face of a dangerous world.
3232	65	The edition was first published in English in the European Conservative magazine.
3233	1	The Empire has not yet finished with the torture of Afghanistan
3233	3	By Pepe Escobar: He is a Brazilian journalist who writes a column, The Roving Eye, for Asia Times Online and is a commentator on Russia's RT and Iran's Press TV. He regularly writes for the Russian news channel Sputnik News and has previously written many opinions for Al Jazeera.
3233	5	Despite its overwhelming defeat, NATO has not yet been completely ready to throw the country of the Afghans into misery.
3233	7	It was once, in a non-distant galaxy, when the Empire of Chaos led the so-called “war against terror” against a weakened cemetery of Empires on the crossroads of Central and South Asia.
3233	9	In the name of national security, the country of the Afghans was bombed until the Pentagon reached the targets, as its chief Donald Rumsfeld, narrating for “known unknown,” then complained.
3233	11	Operation ‘Enduring Captivity’
3233	13	Civil targets, also known as “colateral damage”, have been the rule for years. Many had to flee to neighboring countries to find protection, while tens of thousands were imprisoned for unknown reasons, some even shipped into an illegal imperial Gulag on a tropical island in the Caribbean.
3233	15	War crimes were committed – some of them were kidnapped by an organization led by an excellent journalist who was then psychically tortured for years by the same empire that was obsessed with delivering him to his own prison dystopia.
3233	17	Thro the time, the self-sufficient, civilized “international community” – an abbreviation for the collective West – was practically blind, silent and blind. Afghanistan was occupied by more than 40 nations, while the empire was repeatedly bombed and shot with drones, without condemning its aggression, without one package of sanctions imposed after another, without hundreds of billions of dollars captured, without any punishment.
3233	19	The first victim of the war
3233	21	At the peak of its unipolar power, the empire in Afghanistan could experiment with everything, because freedom of punishment was the norm. Two examples come to my mind: Kandahar, Panjwayi District, March 2012: A imperial soldier kills 16 civilians and then burns their bodies. In Kunduz, April 2018: A final ceremony is welcomed with a Hellfire missile, killing more than 30 civilians.
3233	23	The last act of the imperial “no-aggression” against Afghanistan was a drone attack in Kabul, which did not hit “more suicide terrorists” but instead expanded a ten-headed family, including several children. The questionable “direct threat” identified by the U.S. intelligence services as “ISIS supporters” was in fact a development assistant who returned to his family. The “international community” spread imperial propaganda for days until serious questions were asked.
3233	25	There are also repeated questions about the conditions under which the Pentagon has trained Afghan pilots between 2016 and 2020 to use the A-29 Super Tucano built in Brazil, who have completed more than 2,000 missions to support imperial attacks. During the training at the U.S. Air Force Moody Air Force, more than half of the Afghan pilots have dismissed themselves from the troops, and in the latter most of them were quite unhappy with the accumulation of civilian “colateral damage”. Of course, the Pentagon has not kept records of the Afghan victims.
3233	27	Instead, the U.S. Air Force was praised for the way the Super Tucanos laser bombs dropped on “hostile targets”: Taliban fighters who “cover in cities and places” where civilians live. As by a miracle, it was claimed that the “prizions” strikes “do not hurt the people on the site.”
3233	29	A Afghan refuge in the UK, who was sent away by his family when he was only 13 years old, told something different about his village of Tagab more than a month ago: “There were struggles all the time there. The village belongs to the Taliban (...) My family is still there, I don’t know if she is still alive or dead. I have no contact with them.”
3233	31	Drone Diplomacy
3233	33	One of the first foreign policy decisions of the Obama administration in early 2009 was to launch a drone war over Afghanistan and the tribal areas in Pakistan. Years later, some intelligence analysts from other NATO countries began informing inofficially of the CIA’s impunity: drone attacks would be approved even if the killing of numerous civilians was as secure – as it was not only in “AfPak”, but also in other war sites in West Asia and North Africa.
3233	35	However, the imperial logic is incompatible. The Taliban were by definition “terra crosses” – in the typical Bush dialect. In other words, the villages in the Afghan deserts and mountains were “terra crosses” so that any drone victims would never raise a “human rights issue”.
3233	37	If Afghans – or Palestinians – become collateral damage, it is irrelevant. If they become war refugees, they are a threat. However, the deaths of Ukrainian civilians are acrylicly recorded, and when they become refugees, they are treated as heroes.
3233	39	A massive “data-based defeat”
3233	41	As former British diplomat Alastair Crooke noted, Afghanistan was the final window for technical management, the test field for “every individual innovation in technocratic project management”, including big data, artificial intelligence and military sociology, embedded in “Human Terrain Teams” – this experiment contributed to the creation of the “rule-based international order” of the Empire.
3233	43	But then the U.S.-backed marionette regime in Kabul broke up not with a knall, but with a wimper: a spectacular “data-based defeat.”
3233	45	Hell has no wrath like a dirty empire. As if all the bombings, the drone attacks, the years of crew and the numerous collateral damage were not suffering to be miserable, an angry Washington set another one on it by effectively stealing the Afghan Central Bank $7 billion, i.e. money that belongs to the about 40 million affected Afghan citizens.
3233	47	Now exile Afghans gather together and try to prevent the relatives of the victims of the 11. In September, the U.S. captured $3.5 billion of these funds to repay the debt allegedly being debt by the Taliban – which is absolutely nothing with the 11. September to do.
3233	49	The confiscation of the assets of a poor nation, whose currency is in free case, suffering from a high inflation and a terrible humanitarian crisis, and whose only “crime” consists in defeating the imperial occupation on the battlefield fairly and honestly, is not even practically unlawful. According to all standards, this is considered an international war crime, if it remains. And the collateral damage in this case will mean the end of any “credibility” that the “unnecessary nation” still enjoys.
3233	51	The foreign currency reserves should be refunded to the Central Bank of Afghanistan. But everyone knows that this won’t happen. At best, a limited monthly rate will be released, which is hardly enough to stabilize prices and allow the average savannah to buy vital goods such as bread, food oil, sugar and fuel.
3233	53	The western “Seidenstraße” was dead at its arrival.
3233	55	Today, no one remembers that in July 2011, the U.S. Foreign Ministry presented its own idea of the New Silk Road, which was officially announced by then Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton in a speech in India. Washington’s goal was, at least theoretically, to re-connect Afghanistan with Central and South Asia, with security being prior to the economy.
3233	57	The goal was “to turn enemies into friends and help into trade.” In fact, however, it was about preventing Kabul from entering the influence of Russia and China – represented by the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (SOZ) – after the preliminary withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2014 (the empire will not be officially withdrawn until 2021).
3233	59	The American Silk Road would eventually give the start-up for projects such as the TAPI gas pipeline, the CASA-1000 power pipeline, the Sheberghan thermal power plant and a national glass fiber ring in the telecommunications sector.
3233	61	There has been a lot of talk about the “development of human resources”, the construction of infrastructures – railways, roads, stumblings, economic zones, resource corridors – the promotion of responsible governance and the building of the capacities of “local actors”.
3233	63	A Zombie of an Empire
3233	65	In the end, the Americans did less than nothing. The Chinese, who play the long game, will lead the resurrection of Afghanistan after they have patiently waited for the empire to be dispersed.
3233	67	Afghanistan will be welcomed in the real New Silk Road: the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is funded by the Silk Road Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and is linked to the Chinese-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the Central Asian BRI Corridor and finally the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) led by Russia and the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) led by Iran, India and Russia.
3233	69	Now compare with the imperial Lakays of NATO, whose new “strategic concept” goes beyond an extended war struggle against the global south and beyond – including the external galaxies. At least we know that if NATO is ever pulled back to Afghanistan, another ritual, violent humiliation is ahead.
3234	1	"George W. Bush: ""Russian evidence of dirty bombs is absolutely convincing"""
3234	3	Crawford, Texas (dpo) - Russian claims that Ukraine plans to burn a dirty nuclear bomb are internationally rejected as unreliable. But now Putin is jumping on the side of a prominent American: former President George W. Bush.
3234	5	“I’ve looked at the Russian evidence of the dirty bomb and I think it’s definitely authentic,” Bush said. “The Ira, I mean, Ukraine is clearly in possession of mass destruction weapons. There is no doubt.”
3234	7	From the point of view of Bush, therefore, Putin is legitimate to “Saddam Huss- ääh, I mean Wolodymyr Selenskyj to be violently shut down and to hang up a poster with the words ‘Mission Accomplished’. What do you want to wait for? These Russian PowerPoint files with the smoke reports were at all very convincing.”
3235	1	Russia warns that Ukraine will create a black hole that will smell the earth
3235	3	Moscow (dpo) - Should we all be worried? Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Schoigu warned today clearly that Ukraine is about to create a black hole that will smoke the entire earth.
3235	5	“We have clear evidence that Ukraine is building a black hole production machine. Unfortunately, we can’t show them to you for security reasons,” Schoigu said. According to our information, Ukraine will thus destroy the entire planet.”
3235	7	Russia is now trying everything to cross these terrible plans. “We are already bombing as much infrastructure and children’s playgrounds as possible to prevent the worst,” Schoigu said. But we need more ammunition and drones. Otherwise we can’t save the world.”
3236	1	Federal Minister of Health, which makes the world’s largest Sauffest every year, is afraid of cannabis tourists
3236	3	Klaus Holetschek (CSU), the federal health minister, who annually hosts the world’s largest Sauffest with more than 5 million visitors, has warned that legalizing cannabis could lead to drug tourism.
3236	5	"""The federal government's legalization plans are a dangerous signal not only for Germany, but also for Europe as a whole,"" said the federal health minister with the most brewery and the largest amount of brewed beer (23 million hectoliters) in Germany against the Augsburger Allgemeinen."
3236	7	“There is a fear that a legalization in Germany will also attract cannabis fans from other European countries,” said the federal health minister, who is world-famous for his beer and attracts millions of visitors from all countries of the world every autumn.
3236	9	"The federal government must therefore ensure that ""there are no incentives for a drug tourism to Germany,"" Holetschek demanded a few weeks after alcohol tourists celebrated public excesses at the Oktoberfest (1819 police operations on the Wiesn 2022)."
3237	1	To save energy: Car lights need to stay out in winter
3237	3	Berlin (dpo) - This winter energy savings are required. The Ministry of Transport has also presented the relevant plans. This is the case for all vehicles from 1. In November, all the lighting will remain permanently off – in case of offences, penalties are threatened.
3237	5	“In these difficult times we all have to stay together and save as much electricity as possible,” Transport Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) said. “Only the front panels consume an average of 0.2 kilowatts per hour. Stay out during the journey will save the valuable energy.”
3237	7	Both standing, remote and offshore lights, as well as back lights, interior lights, cloud lock lights and brake lights must then remain out day and night. The use of the blinker should also be avoided. Those who want to move away should see this to other traffic participants by handsign from the open window.
3237	9	“Clarely, it looks nice when cars sweat over our streets at night with festive lighting,” Wissing said. “But do we really need it?”
3237	11	"The Ministry of Transport also considered a ban on the use of automotive radios, but for security reasons it was ultimately excluded. ""Driving in the dark combined with the absence of distraction could cause more people to sleep on the drive,"" Wissing said."
3237	13	The regulation applies until 31. March of 2023. Anyone who still runs with light risks a fine of €70 as well as a point in the power loss map in Flensburg.
3238	1	Excellent experience with Russia: Chancellor's Office wants to sell critical infrastructure to an autoritarian state
3238	3	Berlin, Hamburg (dpo) - What is going wrong? Following the positive experiences of the past months with Russia, Germany now again plans to put critical infrastructure in the hands of an authoritarian state. According to media reports, the chancellor's office wants to allow parts of the Hamburg Harbour to be sold to a Chinese company.
3238	5	“Obviously, the government is still fully influenced by the great success it has given us by selling important parts of the gas infrastructure to Russian state companies,” says Politics expert Sandra Grigoleit. “It seems only consequent to sell the next part of Germany’s largest sea port to a state with one-party dictatorship.”
3238	7	The fact that six out of six special ministries clearly warn of this step seems to be no obstacle from the point of view of Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz. “What is going to be wrong? It is not that China would suddenly invade its democratic neighborhood and try to annex it. Hahaha!“The Federal Chancellor. “Selling parts of the Hamburg Harbour is not a decision that we could sadly regret in a few years or months.”
3238	9	He then announced to convince Xi Jinping at his upcoming Chinese visit to relieve the conflict with Taiwan. “It also worked super with Putin shortly before the Ukrainian war,” Scholz said.
3239	1	Tony Blair Prophecy: The Age of Western Dominance is Close to End
3239	3	"Due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the living standard of a large part of the western population ""stagnates,"" Blair said on Saturday in his annual speech at the Ditchley Foundation."
3239	5	“Western politics is in turmoil – partial, wicked, unproductive, and also heated by social media.” This affects both national and international affairs, Blair complained and argued that Russia’s military operation in Ukraine “must become a point of turn and a point that will revive our Western mission consciousness.” According to the 69-year-old, who led the British government from 1997 to 2007, the greatest geopolitical change of this century will come from China, not Russia. The Blair prophecy:
3239	7	“We are approaching the end of Western political and economic dominance.”
3239	9	China, which is “ready the world’s second superpower,” will compete with the West, “and not only for power, but also against our system, against our way of regulating things and how we live,” the Labour politician warned. “Peking will not be alone. They will have allies. Russia is safe. Maybe Iran too.”
3239	11	Blair said the events in Ukraine had made it clear that the West could not rely on the Chinese leadership to behave as we think it is reasonable. According to him, Chinese President Xi Jinping does not neglect his intention to bring Taiwan back under Beijing’s control. The former British prime minister also said that China under Xi’s leadership is struggling for influence and is doing this in a very “aggressive” way.
3239	13	“Do not misunderstand me. I don't say that China will attempt to recover Taiwan's self-governed island by force in the short term. But we can’t rely on our policy towards China on the certainty that this will never be the case.”
3239	15	"The former prime minister supports the strategy against China, which he calls ""fortress in conjunction with commitment"": one must be ""strong enough"" to deal with China's future position, but not attempt to ""isolate"" itself completely from China, or close channels of interaction and cooperation."
3239	17	In order to remain relevant in a changing environment, the West must develop a common strategy “which is followed with coordination, commitment and competence.” “The West must provide higher defence spending to preserve military superiority, but at the same time use the so-called “small power” to expand relations with emerging countries,” Blair concluded.
3239	19	Russian President Vladimir Putin recently said that the policy of depression and weakening of Russia is a long-term strategy for the West and the sanctions would have put a heavy blow to the entire world economy. According to him, the main goal of the West is to deteriorate the lives of millions of people.
324	1	Chronicles of Hass Campaign
324	3	"Peter Biesenbach, former Justice Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, is making a great rhetoric blow — in the style of Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon. With regard to the COVID-19 vaccination, Biesenbach characterized the dictatorship: ""A small picks for the individual for the great freedom of all.""The message to the ""immunity"" was clear: As small your duty would have been, so great the service you would have done to mankind. And you rejected this minimum sacrifice for the people’s good — shame for you!"
324	5	The moral furor of the Chorknaben of the Power Party has been as intense as rhetorically invasive in recent years. In accordance with their own self-image, they acted as well-minded servants, only interested in the health of the people, which was threatened by a number of brain-and-conscious egoists. They were called vaccine refusers, curlers, cross-minders or covidiots.
324	7	In the crisis, the Corona bubbles crumbled everywhere out of their holes and seemed unable to want to release all those aggressive energies that they had kept closed until then. At the same time, the prominent and high-ranking hotsters, such as Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery or Tübingen’s mayor Boris Palmer, can get out of calculated, cool-calculating attacks, which have been launched in the awareness of their potential devastating effects on the social climate.
324	9	If it had been spontaneous rage, you could have gone away from it. Thus, however, it was just the powers that broke the country, whose representative function would actually have had to stop for measurement and reconciliation, people who more than others have the task of keeping society together. Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
324	11	Worst of Corona mainstream
324	13	It is due to the book of Klöckner and Wernicke that all these incomprehensible statements of confusion have only been distorted from unnecessary memories. The two authors have presented a “Worst of Corona-mainstream” that it has in itself, a valuable document of ethical and intellectual conservation that could keep in this “civilized” country. Wernicke and Klöckner appeal with their book to the now quite well-known website “ich-habe-mitgemacht.de”. In this, “the extent of authoritarian disagreement in our society will be visible.” On the page it says:
324	15	“Because the criminals will discuss from today to tomorrow any involvement, evidence must be collected in order to bring about the one or the other civilization’s breakdown of forgiveness.”
324	17	Individual brutal statements of various honors about non-vaccinates and “quuerminders” have been multiply analyzed and verbally attacked in the free media. But there has never been such an extensive and approximately complete collection in written form as the work of Klöckner and Wernick.
324	19	You can also read the book exhaustive by simply overflowing the black-marked original quotes of the Corona line faiths. This can already cause evilness and gives a first impression of the extent of the “spiritually-moral turn”—as Helmut Kohl had expressed—which we have experienced. In this case, a turn to worse and even worse.
324	21	Whoever only has the time for a single Corona book — with this he is well advised. There is a good overview, divided into certain assassination groups such as politicians, journalists, justice and “elites”. The second half of the publication is dedicated entirely to the analysis of individual quotes whose scope is clear with regard to the erosion of democracy and humanity.
324	23	The work gives a first overview of what happened, while the previous “Corona literature” is mostly still in the middle of the battle. So cruel the words of the Corona line faiths listed in it may be — whoever was skeptical from the beginning can feel confirmed and encouraged, for being an opponent of such antidemocratic puppy, honors him.
324	25	More and more readers are confronted with distorted, unhindered views during discussions in the private area. Everything hadn’t been so bad, unvaccinated people showed themselves as victims... Klöckner’s and Wernick’s book gives them good arguments for such discussions. But, it was bad — very bad. The work thus provides a service to freedom-loving readers as well as to society as a whole, whose healing process can not even begin without an adequate diagnosis or be completed.
324	27	Cheating is not harmless
324	29	The quotes of the various diffamers are not just gathered and placed in the room, they are commented in detail and very brightly by the two authors. Let’s take as an example the title quote by journalist Nikolaus Blome on “Spiegel online”:
324	31	“I would, on the other hand, expressly ask for social disadvantages for all those who voluntarily give up vaccination. Let the whole Republic show it with the finger.”
324	33	Is it not harmless? What’s so bad about showing someone with the finger? Clöckner and Wernicke comment:
324	35	In other words, he says nothing but that the group of those who don’t want to be vaccinated against Corona shows such negligent behavior that they should be placed on the pranger. Showing someone with the finger means exposing someone in our language understanding. If a person shows another with his finger because he has done something that is morally disturbing, then it can be very bad for the affected.”
324	37	This is especially dangerous in the social context:
324	39	“But if a whole country exposes a person or a group, then it has nothing to do with a normal interhuman conflict. It can also be expressed differently: Blome puts the unvaccinated on the pranger and in principle urges to make them publicly misleading and humiliating. But with this requirement, he gives to the own dynamics of a social and individual behavior a space that he cannot control at all.”
324	41	The Trauma Tats
324	43	The two authors of the new book from the Rubikon Publishing have another name for this verbal Amok running “good”: they call them “trauma-tathers.” Is this term not exaggerated? No, because, as the trauma therapist Franz Ruppert says in the prejudice, you are not traumatized only when you are a victim of physical violence, war or flood catastrophe.
324	45	“This can happen at the mental level through lies, fraud, humiliation, disgrace, disgrace and humiliation.”
324	47	And thus the Corona years will be kept in memory: as an era of degradation and humiliation. Ruppert writes about the mentality of the criminals:
324	49	“It may be that trauma actors do not respect any limits, neither legal nor moral. Therefore, it happens that trauma actors do things that seem completely strange to the healthy human mind. If their evil acts are not to be denied, the main objective of trauma actors is to present themselves as innocent. For this, it is best to try the victim-actor turn, that is, to present yourself as the real victim, to spread lies about the victims, to blame and shame them.”
324	51	This is exactly what happened to the unvaccinated and Corona skeptics in the years 2020-2022. Now it is inevitable that, in a society, behavioral, intellectually and ethically completely distorted persons repeatedly raise their heads. It becomes dangerous only when the community’s immune system fails to refer it to its barriers. Ruppert writes about this:
324	53	“If it seems that traumatic actors can convince themselves and others of their assassin’s ideology, they can allow themselves to hide their actions less and less and to act entirely meaningless and purposefully or overwhelmingly.”
324	55	Is that totalitarianism?
324	57	Klöckner and Wernicke also speak of “human hunting”. One of these people in the Corona years was able to stand out when they peacefully struggled on the street for their fundamental rights—in the end, even for the rights of those who did not overthrow their disinterest in freedom. The physical impairment of the opposition was also in many ways in danger. Not only was there a massive flame of police violence, there was an increase in suicides and psychosomatic diseases; also the vaccination obligation was not just a threat for many people, it was reality unless they had the power to resist despite punishment in the form of employment loss or social isolation at any price. For many, the increasing vaccine pressure until winter 2021/2022 was a Russian roulette game with their health and their lives.
324	59	“What would a vaccination obligation mean for you? Would they be forced to vaccinate themselves and thus take the risk of damaging their health due to the effects of the vaccine?”
324	61	Thus, we have to ask ourselves further questions that are avoided by most “normal” so far for good reason. Was and is the Corona system, as it has shown itself in Germany, totalitarian? The authors cite in this context the philosopher Michael Andrick. According to Andrick, “in the course of the coronapolithic crisis, the Federal Republic of Germany has demonstrated its ability to act at a point of totalitarism (...) and the vast majority of state servants have demonstrated unquestionable follow-up in the implementation: mass protests in offices and schools were not to be observed.”
324	63	The question of fascism
324	65	And yet, the authors wise to get to another brisant term — knowing that they could negotiate with it a subscription to disturbance storms: “fascism.” They argue that “the question of ‘Entnacification’, as disturbing or disturbing it may affect one or another, cannot only be asked, but must be asked. At least if the term ‘Nazi’ is not understood in the narrow historical sense as a supporter of National Socialism or Hitler’s fascism.”
324	67	The people often use the term “Nazi” with a healthy instinct when “a citizen is authoritarian to his fellow people. Behaviors such as the rushing of neighbors (often due to disadvantages), the striking, sometimes also unhuman change of rules, but also a misery-based exclusion and devaluation of people were widespread in society in the Third Empire.”
324	69	Whoever cannot or wants to see these parallels, does not in any way protect the victims of historic national-socialism from “relativization” — he leaves the victims of new unhumanity in the shadow by denying their status of victim and falls in the back of those who want to defend the beginnings.
324	71	“The people who say ‘Nazi’ today have understood that it would be too easy to call the Nazis ‘Nazi’ only when he with uniforms and any symbols in the sphere of politics and society treats his ignorance and presses political fascism on all levels of society to the family. Political fascism can – and many don’t understand it – often well build on the daily fascism of the individual citizen. Political fascism imposes that values and fundamentals, which are a great obstacle to him, are removed from the bottom when the corresponding signals come from the top. It requires some who are ready (and they are always there), as well as many who look away and let everything happen backwardly.”
324	73	The “Nazi” in us all
324	75	In this context, the authors also refer to Ron Jones, the American teacher whose famous fascist experiment has become the model for the book and film The Wave. Jones said in an interview:
324	77	“We think that fascism is something that can only exist at the level of a state. (But) Fascism is something that can occur in your home, in your workplace, in your church, in your school, in your editorial. Fascism can be anywhere. And you have to stand up.”
324	79	Jones, as well as Klöckner and Wernicke, is important, “that it is understood how from the authoritarian citizen one day may be the ‘Nazi’ in a political system. Whoever thus understands the term, whoever thus perceives fascism, does not relate the horror domination of the German national-socialists in the last century, but this understanding contributes to the fact that the wicked exclusion, devaluation and diffamation of people and groups — no matter how much these acts are sold by politics and media as ‘good’ — are recognized in time as what they are: a fascist act!
324	81	It can also be said that the actions of the Corona regime did not reach the same dimension of incomprehensible cruelty as the crimes of the Nazis. This, however, was not necessarily because the mentality of today’s Germans would necessarily prevent such horrors, so that their educated democratic conscience and courage would have driven them to timely appeal.
324	83	Instead, we came relatively glimpse of it to this day, because the rulers have not so far decided to fully use their power and propaganda means and to wake up the “sleeping fascists” in many citizens in this way. For in the years 2020-2022, it has become clear that the learning success from the events of the Third Empire is a terribly smaller — and this, although it has not been missing in any way in the warnings of teachers and politicians, in the relevant historical films and books about the Nazis. The fascist tendencies had only to put on another mask—a very careful and human-friendly—but they were not recognized by most contemporaries.
324	85	It should never happen again!
324	87	Even worse, the anti-fascist furor, which the left and green environment had just emerged for decades from most honest motives — it was now opposed exclusively to what was felt as “bagatelizing Nazis,” but not to those beginnings that the post-war society had repeatedly promised in thousands of pathetic Jubilee speeches to refuse.
324	89	The consequence is that “the society has not, at least in its entirety, learned what would be necessary to recognize and disappear pre-fascist tendencies already in its chest,” Klöckner and Wernicke said.
324	91	And if she did not learn that, then she did not learn anything. It also does not matter that large parts of society have understood to never form themselves under the NS symbolic. This is good and right, but to confront political developments that limit people, it needs more.”
324	93	We can’t make the recent past happening anymore. What it needs is, above all, processing.
324	95	The pandemic policy, as well as its catastrophic errors, must be drawn up, as well as the fever and discrimination against non-vaccinated and action critics. Parliament, justice and media are the core pillars of our democracy. In the pandemic, all pillars were broken right. They did not stand the pressure. Everything must be on the table. As it is for a democratic rule of law. We must never again, whether in a new pandemic or anything else, come into a situation where effective protection of fundamental rights is no longer given and fascist developments can be seen.”
324	97	Unhumanity on Stand-by
324	99	The authors are aware that they move on thin ice with Nazi comparisons — but only because in Germany a disturbance culture has emerged, which has now accepted the character of an argumentative protective wall with all kinds of fascist tendencies. In respect of the darkest chapter in German history there is no lack of Klöckner and Wernicke. They act rather cautiously, but, where appropriate, remain unbeatable and consistent.
324	101	“The fact that there is to be careful that Nazis will never become a political force and that Jewish citizens will never be attacked or persecuted, is understood by itself. But to deal responsibly with the dark history of Germany means to realize that certain incentives in people, even dissolved by the national-socialist ideology, can lead to a horror that is not unlike that of the Nazis.”
324	103	The authors already put a fascist alarm, “when a group of people is devalued in their being. A mix of authority, a sense of superiority, sadism, regelfeticism, and compensation for their own insufficiency are among other things drivers when it comes to the devaluation of human groups.”
324	105	These phenomena occurred in the majority society’s dealing with non-vaccinations without any doubt.
324	107	It is easier, of course, to wait for the hackers and victory-help calls and to vote — as long as they do not show themselves — in a healing-world democracy. Fascism, according to the two authors, is less a certain historical era—in this case we would have it behind us and shouldn’t be cautious—; Fascism is a tendency that sleeps in the bottom of any society and can wake up at a suitable occasion like a sleeping court dog.
324	109	Certain destructive forces are almost always in stand-by operation:
324	111	Since the authority, the fascist, is always present in people and societies through a variety of factors, it never takes a long time for other actors who behave similarly to enter the stage. Once the opportunity is given through the outside, they will be there.”
324	113	Make the truth transparent
324	115	Therefore, the foundation of the book “I want that the whole country, instead of continuing to operate victim blaming, finally attract the real criminals to responsibility” is also characterized by disappointment. Ulrike Guérot, a political scientist and even a Corona skeptic victim of a media hot hunt, writes in her prejudice to the book:
324	117	“Isn’t we the land of ‘will be the beginning’? Do we, like no other country, have a well-financed Federal Centre for Political Education? Did not the political education in this country be kept as high as hardly elsewhere? So it could have been expected that the knowledge of the Basic Law has passed in flesh and blood to all the German citizens, just as Christians are our Father.”
324	119	Disappointment cannot be confused with resignation. The fact that now, over so many years, everything has gone in the wrong direction is a call to radical conversion for all of us. There is still a lot to change so that the injustice that has occurred becomes obvious to all, so that thought, correction and healing are possible. However, the basic conditions that this can happen include documents that make the truth recognizable and public to everyone. It is the great merit of Marcus Klöckner and Jens Wernicke to have achieved this with their book.
324	121	Extrusion – the fluid poison
324	123	Surface-looking, the majority of the public seems not yet ready for the repair of our broken democracy. The need is too high to simply not admit any mistakes. Ulrike Guérot writes in her prejudice:
324	125	The way we as a society want to find out of this colossal tragedy, in which, on the one and on the other hand, uncertain damage has occurred, peacefully and through the treatment of the multiple suffering, is not yet made. It doesn’t even seem to be a need of a large majority to do any effort to meet this task.”
324	127	However, deportation may be even more dangerous for the health of a democratic society than what is to be deported. This is what Guérot says:
324	129	“That depression, however, is like a cancer in every body, even in a society. It is therefore urgent to work on the events of the last three years, to establish a parliamentary investigation committee, to punish the responsible, to rehabilitate the dismissed and to compensate the victims. This has been done with every great crime so far, and the Corona policy has been and is a great crime against mankind and humanity.”
324	131	If this does not happen, Guérot looks black or rather brown:
324	133	“In a democracy, this is clear, so that the social cancer does not cause society and democracy to be devastated from within.”
3240	1	Paris: Thousands protest against high prices
3240	3	The atmosphere in France has been strongly tensioned for days. It’s already over two weeks that a strike of refinery staff takes for more wages, which is why there is a lack of spray at many gas stations in the country. On Sunday, thousands of protesters went to the streets in Paris to express their discomfort over the rising cost of living.
3240	5	Jean-Luc Mélenchon, former president candidate and chairman of the left-wing party La France insoumise (LFI). A number of other left-wing parties and organizations took part in the protest, with some of them calling on President Emmanuel Macron to take stronger measures against climate change.
3240	7	The protesters are primarily concerned with economic concerns. The LFI chairman told France 3 on Sunday morning:
3240	9	“It’s not the march of Mr. Mélenchon. It is a march of people who are hungry, who are cold and who want to be paid better.”
3240	11	The price rise is irreversible, LFI deputy Manon Aubry told AFP. It’s the biggest purchasing power loss in 40 years,” she added. The protesters demanded, among other things, an increase in wages, a price freeze, the 60’s retirement and the taxation of corporate overwinnings.
3240	13	France's inflation rate is currently at 6 percent, and almost all industries of the country report a decline in economic activity due to the rising energy prices and increasing uncertainty, mostly due to the sanctions of the European Union (EU) against Russian fossil fuels after Moscow's military operation in Ukraine began.
3240	15	As the energy bills of private households rise rapidly, the demand for fuel is again in France, and electricity failures were predicted.
3240	17	The police talked about 30,000 participants in the protest race on Sunday, the organizers in turn about 140,000. It has also been, among other things, of collisions between left radicals – which occur regularly in French protests – and police officers. In the videos circulating on social media, you can see how security forces also use drinking gases.
3240	19	In the middle of the protests, the French trade union CGT continues the strikes in the oil refineries and calls for a ten-percent increase in wages for the workers in light of the high inflation. Thus, the CGT wants to that workers will be more involved in TotalEnergies’ profits. The company is expected to have gained $10.6 billion in the first half of 2022. The trade union said on Saturday it has rejected an offer of 6 percent higher salary. Moreover, on Tuesday, several trade unions in the French Railway and in the Paris Medium Traffic have called for the dismissal of work.
3241	1	Disaster for Biden: Republicans Lead in Surveys for “Midterms” and 2024
3241	3	Shock for U.S. President Joe Biden and his Democratic Schickeria! If the 2024 presidential election took place today, his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, would be the winner. The same is indicated for the upcoming midterm elections on the 8. November of J. and ab. The main reason for the sympathy fall of the Biden regime: the high energy prices and rising inflation. This is by the magazine Weekblick.at.
3241	5	According to a survey by the Harvard/Harris Institute, 62% of respondents say they are guilty. By the way, only 2% of the likely voters believe that Ukraine is the main problem for the United States.
3241	7	Trend since September
3241	9	Also on Monday, a New York Times/College Siena survey found that the dynamics in the interim elections (Midterms, Congress elections = Senate and House of Deputies) are clearly in the benefit of the Republicans. According to the survey, 49 percent of the likely voters said they would vote for a Republican to represent them in Congress at the Midterms. This is compared to 45 percent who want to vote for a Democrat. This improved the results for the Republicans since September, when the Democrats had a point of advance in the last survey.
3241	11	Women move to Trump camp
3241	13	The biggest shift came from women who identified themselves as independent voters. In September, they favored the Democrats by 14 points. Now they supported the Republicans with 18 points. Biden is now believed to be able to encourage women with the introduction of a federal abortion law. Earlier this week, he announced that it was the top priority for the next year. Those who want freedom of choice must choose Democrats in the Senate, he said. For months, there has been a hot debate on the introduction of a law on abortion in all states. A judgment by the Supreme Court – known as “Roe versus Waden” – made it temporary. Biden spoke of “extremism.” Republican-governed states defend themselves with their hands and feet against an abortion law.
3241	15	The Biden Policy
3241	17	The real concerns of the voters ignore the Biden group consistently. Not the climate change, not the interim in Chapter 6. January 2021, Biden classified as domestic terrorism, even Covid or Ukraine are not interested in the people. Instead, it is the economy and inflation that makes Americans create every day. However, the Biden regime has no practical solutions. 44 percent of Americans, across all ages, say these two areas make them the biggest concern, compared to 36 percent in July. The fact that the U.S. de facto appears in Ukraine as a war party against Russia is also little understood. For only 2 percent, this is a major problem for the United States.
3241	19	Hispanic voters turn around
3241	21	Therefore, it is above all the independent voters who are very concerned about the Democrats. According to the survey, the Republicans gained a 10 percent advance in this group, compared to a three percent advance for the Democrats in September. Especially the lack of economic competence of the Biden group is often indicated as a reason for this.
3241	23	And another group of voters could come away from them: the Hispanic population, which already accounts for 18.5 percent of the U.S. population. Their role in the economy and their purchasing power is significant. The Bidens policy is now so insisting on this group that 37 percent are already concerned about the economic situation. More than white (25 percent) and black (22 percent). Family, faith and freedom still play an important role in this group, values with which the new “Democratic Schickeria” cannot start. The abortion debate is also here.
3241	25	Trump Creates Jobs for Minorities
3241	27	The bill was recently presented to them by the long-term deputy and party leader, Tulsi Gabbard. She shifted because of the intolerance and extremist attitude of the Biden party to the Trump camp already in the last election many Hispanics voted for Trump. The reason for this: During his term, the economy boomed, the unemployment rate in its and the black population fell to a historic bottom. The Spanish vote will be crucial in the upcoming midterm and the 2024 presidential election in some states. This affects mainly the U.S. states Texas and California (each 40 percent anti-Hispanic), New Mexico (50 percent), Arizona (32 percent), Nevada (29 percent) and Florida (27 percent).
3242	1	Study from Italy examines possible health risks caused by phthalates in face masks when used during COVID-19 pandemic
3242	3	In a recent study conducted in Italy, researchers studied the presence of phtalic acid esters (PAEs) or phtalates in commercial facial masks to evaluate the health risks associated with increased use of facial masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.
3242	5	The most commonly used facial masks during the pandemic were surgical masks, non-chirurgical masks and respiratory protective masks with filter application (FFP). The layers of all these face masks consist of polypropylene, polyester, polycarbonate, polystyrol or polyethylene, which contain all dangerous chemicals such as phtalates, which are used to improve the flexibility of the material.
3242	7	Phthalates are associated with disorders of the hormone system and potentially cancerous effects and are subject to strict regulations. The EU has banned the use of some phtalates in cosmetics, and the use of most PAEs is only permitted with special permission. Since the use of face masks has increased significantly with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers wanted to identify the risks associated with their prolonged use.
3242	9	In this study, the concentrations of 11 PAEs in 35 commercial facial masks in Italy were evaluated using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method developed in this study. The risk assessment based on the GC/MS results included the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health effects.
3242	11	Of the 35 masks surveyed, 31% were FFP2 masks with four or five layers, 63% were triangular surgical masks and 6% were non-chirurgical triangular masks. The masks included 24 masks for adults and 11 masks for children.
3242	13	The risk quota (HQ) was calculated to assess the non-carcinogenic risk of phtalate exposure, and the risk index (HI) was used to understand the cumulative non-carcinogenic risks. The resulting non-effect levels (DNELs) were calculated from NOAELs (no observed adverse effect levels) or LOAELs (lowest observed adverse effect levels). They were correlated with exposure to assess the risk for human health. To evaluate the carcinogenic risks of phtalate exposure, risk characterization quotas (RCRs) were used and derived minimum effect strengths (DMELs) were calculated.
3242	15	The results of the GC/MS assessment showed that four phthalates were demonstrated in all the examined face masks, in concentrations that were far beyond the evidence limit. The other phthalates were below the evidence limit (LoD).
3242	17	The exposure doses for the four proven phthalates varied between 6.43 x 10-5 mg/kg body weight/day and 1.43 x 10-2 mg/kg body weight/day. The phalat with the highest exposure value (74.32 %) was bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), while the value for DIBP was 22.15 % and DBP (2.40 %) and BBP (1.12 %) had a significantly lower share.
3242	19	The average HI levels of phtalate exposure for adults and children were not above the permissible values and indicated no non-cancerogenic harmful effects. However, for seven of the 35 facial masks, that is 20%, the cumulative RCR values exceed the permissible limits for cancer-related health risks.
3242	21	The authors concluded that although most of the examined face masks are considered safe in application, the overall results indicate that the potential carcinogenic risks of face masks need to be further investigated.
3243	1	Berlin reports overload by too many refugees
3243	3	“When we were the city states and especially Berlin as the main educational point, our capacities have now been almost exhausted,” Giffey told Bild am Sonntag. So 340,000 Ukrainians were first provided in Berlin, 100,000 now have their residence in the capital.
3243	5	“We urgently need more federal properties to accommodate people well, financial support for the immense costs and a fair distribution in the federal territory,” Giffey continued.
3243	7	“In the end, we need not only decisions, but concrete measures,” says Gerd Landsberg, head of business of the German City and Municipality Federation. “The accommodation possibilities are limited,” Landsberg also warned in “Bild am Sonntag”. “Hotel rooms are now being rented and collective accommodations are prepared, for example in tournament halls.”
3243	9	Sachsen Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer (CDU) also said in the same newspaper: “The federal government must finally support the financing of the accommodation. The municipalities are at the attack, without the promised support they will soon be unable to act.”
3243	11	According to the newspaper, the Federal Police is fixing around 400 unlawful entrances on all German borders daily with a focus on the German-Czech and German-Austrian land border. 
3244	1	Federal government calls for Italy to leave migrants
3244	3	of Berlin. The federal government has urged Italy and Malta not to further hinder migration over the Mediterranean. It is a moral and legal obligation to protect shipping migrants from drowning, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said on Monday.
3244	5	Previously, Italian and Maltese authorities had banned the landing of four ships with hundreds of migrants on board in the ports of the two countries. Where should a Norwegian ship go? It’s easy to go to Norway,” said infrastructure minister Matteo Salvini.
3244	7	Half of the migrants' ships sail under German flag
3244	9	Four ships with hundreds of asylum seekers on board the European Mediterranean coast are currently waiting for permission to enter ports – the Geo Barents, the Ocean Viking, the Rise Above and the Humanity 1. Two of the ships sail under the German flag. Some of the migrants had already been allowed to land in Sicily for medical reasons.
3244	11	"The ""Rise Above"" association ""Mission Lifeline"" complained of the situation on board the rescue vapor re-functioning. Even if the weather has improved slightly, the situation will continue to worsen due to the enormous mental burden of the people on board. Every hour is now counting to prevent worse things,” the organization said on Monday on its website. Italy and Malta have opened their ports. "
3245	1	Tone becomes narrow: Kühnert calls the Union for “lews” in the civil money dispute
3245	3	In the struggle between the Ampel coalition and the Union on the citizen money, the tone becomes narrow. The CDU/CSU has “finally lost itself in the Bermuda triangle from Klamauk, desinformation and humour,” SPD Secretary-General Kevin Kühnert told the news of the Funke Media Group. “There are consciously spread false numbers and lies, according to which people in Germany have more citizen money than those who work. There are long-lived stories told by supposedly super-rich citizen money-related people.”
3245	5	In particular, Kühnert attacked the CDU chairman and EU party leader Friedrich Merz. “Under Merz, the CDU has become a party that puts party tactics on social cohesion,” he said. In the European Union, “the voices of reason” are now being asked. The CDU government politicians in the federal countries are primarily locally unemployed people and are committed to the urgently necessary improvements in the local job centers, “not their party headquarters in Berlin”.
3245	7	The citizen money will replace the Hartz-IV system by January, according to the will of the Ampel coalition. The parliamentary referendum is scheduled for Thursday. However, the law is mandatory in the Federal Council – for the necessary majority, the “Ampel” needs the support of countries with CDU/CSU government participation. However, the Union continues to reject the project even after some changes by the coalition.
3245	9	The Union wants improvements in wealth
3245	11	“In particular, the wealth and the sanctions require substantial improvements,” said parliamentary chief executive of the Union Fraktion, Thorsten Frei (CDU). “For the system change proposed by the Ampel to an unconditional basic income, we will in any case not give the hand,” he said to the “Rheinische Post”.
3245	13	CDU deputy Carsten Linnemann told the “Bild” newspaper that he sees in the public money a “attack on the principle of promoting and demanding.” “Honest work is obviously no more important in Germany,” he added. CDU Secretary-General Mario Czaja told the newspaper that the Ampel government’s policy is “respectless to the citizens who go to work every day and keep the social state running with their taxes.”
3245	15	The Chairman of the Workers Group of the Union Fraktion, Axel Knoerig (CDU), told AFP that the SPD should “finally return to the path of reason.” He confirmed the proposal of his party to decide on Thursday in the Bundestag first only to raise the regulations and to continue negotiations on the further aspects of the citizen money.
3245	17	The rise of the regulations was “incitively required,” Knoerig said in view of the high inflation. For aspects such as the mediation in the labour market and the wealth, “there is, in our view, a clear need for improvement.” This should be discussed “unresolved by the rise of the rules”. The Ampel coalition has already rejected this protest.
3246	1	Overfishing North Sea
3246	3	It is about fishing quotas and underwater terrains. Therefore, the Member States of the European Union (EU) rank in the annual rate which country, including the non-EU member of Norway, is allowed to catch from a fishery in a specified area and period. This is established through the Common Fisheries Policy, which has been established since 1978.
3246	5	The negotiations were never. And more complicated they became after the UK’s “Brexit” in early February 2020. Now the EU and the UK negotiate the fisheries stocks separately each year. The conversation is ongoing since the third. November and may take weeks. There are also environmental associations.
3246	7	Because: Some of the fish stocks that the UK and the EU shared are very exhausted and overfishing, several environmental protection organizations announced on Monday. Activists from Oceana, the largest international NGO to protect the world’s seas, according to their own statements, are based on a recent report by the Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture (CEFA). According to the report, two-thirds of the British fishing restrictions in 2021 were above the values recommended by marine researchers. A disintegration with consequences.
3246	9	"Example of Kabeljau: Its stocks in the North Sea have decreased by more than 90 percent, the environmental defenders documented in their statement. A historical depth. Valeska Diemel, a fishing expert at the Federation for Environment and Nature Conservation (BUND), confirmed this “dramatic crossing” on Monday. That really shouldn’t happen. In 2020, the EU had set in its common fishing policy that “on the individual stocks only so many fish may be taken, as well as after growing,” a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) said on the same day to jW. This principle of sustainability of the highest possible sustainable income (MSY, Maximum sustainable yield) is the ""guide"" for the federal government. Only, according to Diemel, one thing must be clarified again and again: “The MSY values are a defined limit value, the maximum, not the target value.”"
3246	11	Clause Ubl seems to have too much alarm from the eco-activists. The North Sea does not belong to the seas that are most under overfishing, the media referent from the German Fishing Association said on Monday to jW. And in general: between the EU and the UK, no fishing quotas would be negotiated, but the total allowable fishing amounts for the fish stocks used. These would be divided by a key that was set in the trade agreement between the EU and London after the Brexit, Ubl said.
3246	13	This doesn’t sound calming, even if the situation in the north-east Atlantic – which is the North Sea – has improved. Philipp Kanstinger from WWF Germany to this newspaper: Currently, about 30 to 40 percent of the fish stocks in the North Sea would be overfishing. For comparison: “Around twenty years ago, it was still up to 80 percent.”The trend thus goes slowly in the right direction – “but there is still a lot to do.” Like the cable.
3246	15	Therefore, there is no reason to be warned, because “overfishing can basically cause fish stocks to collapse,” the BMEL spokesman said. Especially because unfavorable environmental conditions and the climate crisis could exacerbate the situation in the North Sea. To do so more, the German Environmental Aid (DUH) urges decision makers at EU level to finally act. They had so far missed the deadline for terminating the overfishing, the DUH on JW request. Now, in the current round of negotiations, they could do it better.
3246	17	Another problem is the control. The monitoring network of the fishing quotas is, apart from sample checks, lazy and based on correctly data of the high-sea fishing companies, Diemel from BUND knows. The criticism continues. The EU acts too briefly when it negotiates “any by year fishing quotas for individual stocks”. Individual considerations would not match the complexity of the sea ecosystem. “And not least,” Diemel emphasized, “we have to get away from a business approach of maximum revenue and permanent increase in profits of industrial fishing.”
3247	1	Action Against Russia: EU Launches New Sanctions
3247	3	The EU has launched a ninth package of sanctions against Russia. The Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Member States approved the plans in Brussels. The last EU summit of this year will discuss the sanctions package against Russia and further decisions.
3247	5	The EU has launched a ninth package of sanctions against Russia. At the end of the EU summit in Brussels, the committee of the permanent representatives of the Member States unanimously approved plans, including new criminal measures against Russian banks and additional trade restrictions.
3247	7	Previously, a day-long dispute was brought about possible unwanted side effects of sanctions. Germany, together with countries such as France and the Netherlands, had called for certain rules to be amended in the course of the new sanctions package to prevent deterioration of trade in agricultural products and fertilizers.
3247	9	"Other countries such as Poland and Lithuania argued that reports on agricultural exports allegedly prevented by sanctions were ""Russian propaganda"" aimed at weakening EU sanctions. The two sides eventually agreed to a compromise. According to diplomats, he takes into account the demands to guarantee food security."
3247	11	In addition to trade and financial sanctions, the ninth package has included a list of 200 persons and entities since the beginning of the war against Ukraine at the end of February. They are blocked and banned from entering the EU. EU has sanctioned more than 1,200 individuals and 118 organizations for violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the sovereignty of the country.
3247	13	The list of the new names is expected to be published in the EU Official Journal soon after the necessary written decision-making procedure is completed. According to the previous information of the EU Commission, among others the Russian army, individual officers, Members of the State Duma and Governors will be included.
3247	15	Following the Russian drone attacks on Ukraine in recent months, Moscow’s access to drones and other unmanned aircraft will also be cut. Four other television shows will be withdrawn due to the spread of war propaganda.
3248	1	Switzerland refuses to test for Chinese tourists
3248	3	Unlike many EU countries, Switzerland is now giving up a test obligation for travellers from China. Instead, these people are advised to wear a mask and follow further hygiene measures. This was decided by the Federal Council on Wednesday.
3248	5	Several countries, including the neighboring countries Germany, Austria, Italy and France, have in recent days agreed to strengthen entrance rules for travellers from China. Switzerland only recommends such people to wear a mask and follow further hygiene measures, as the state government’s Wednesday announcement shows.
3248	7	The epidemiological situation does not require any test obligation, the Federal Council said. Due to the Omikron variants circulating in China, it is presently exposed to a low risk for the population in Switzerland and for the Swiss health system. The risk of developing new, worrying variants in China is not higher than elsewhere.
3248	9	According to the Federal Council, people in Switzerland have a high protection against a severe course of Covid-19 disease. Furthermore, the virus circulation in Switzerland is so high that a test obligation for a relatively small number of people who enter directly from China by aircraft has hardly an impact on the spread of the virus in Switzerland.
3248	11	But the Federation continues to monitor the situation, as the government assures. The existing wastewater monitoring also includes the national airports and important tourist areas. Also, the viral variants would continue to be monitored by sequencing waste water samples and hospitalized cases.
3248	13	According to the Federal Council, Switzerland will also clarify whether the wastewater of all flights that arrive directly from China will be targeted according to new viral variants. In the identification of new viral variants, Switzerland will “examine adjustments of the border sanitary measures if necessary.” The EU has announced a review of the recommendations by mid-January 2023.
3248	15	After the end of the zero-covid policy, China has opened itself back to abroad after almost three years. Entrance was made easier, and travel from the People's Republic to abroad was made more possible.
3248	17	At the same time, a massive wave of infection runs through the country, which met the hospitals completely unprepared. Despite the opening, there is no major tour wave expected from China. The number of flights from there to abroad is currently only a fraction of the volume as before the pandemic. Tickets are very expensive.
3249	1	Von der Leyen met Meloni to talk about migration
3249	3	EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen has held talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome. The issue of migration and the implementation of the EU-funded CoV reconstruction plan in Italy are the topics of the bilateral talks, the government in Rome said in advance. Italy wants more time to implement the objectives agreed with the EU. Talks on possible changes to the plan are ongoing with Brussels.
3249	5	Italy is waiting for the EU Commission to evaluate Rome’s request for the financing of the third section of the restructuring plan. The EU has approved EUR 200 billion for projects that are planned to be implemented by 2026. Meloni called for a review of the plan given the situation changed by the war in Ukraine and the high inflation.
3249	7	The issue of migration will be on the table at the summit of state and government leaders in February. Italy’s goal is to create a comprehensive plan for the return of migrants and a closer cooperation with the countries of origin.
3249	9	Von der Leyen is concerned about the new course of Melonis in immigration after the adoption of a decree with rules of conduct for NGOs engaged in rescue actions in the Mediterranean. “It is not the task of the EU to deal with the content of this decree. Regardless of this, Member States must respect international law and sea law,” EU Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said last week. “Rescue human lives on the sea is a moral and legal obligation,” Hipper added. NGOs have last protested against the decree adopted by the government Meloni.
3249	11	At the end of December, the Italian government adopted a decree to make the landing of rescue ships in southern Italy more difficult. The Cabinet wants to restrict systematic rescue actions by NGO ships bringing migrants to Italy.
325	1	"The White House is now pursuing the same solar blocking program, which was referred to as two years ago as the ""conversion theory""."
325	3	The White House Office for Science and Technology Policy has launched a five-year research plan aimed at developing methods to throw the sunlight back into space to “cool” the planet and keep it from the “global warming”.
325	5	Even a few years ago, the independent media was referred to as the wild “devration theorists” because they had warned that climate culturists would take a different path and take the sun directly into the vision to eliminate them. Now the conspiracy theories we warned you are becoming conspiracy facts.
325	7	The idea behind the new sun protection program is to regulate the UV voltage on Earth. If enough of it can be blocked and reflected back into space, the temperatures may be slightly cool, which will benefit the polls and prevent floods on the coast in the future.
325	9	One way the globalists want to block the sun is sprinkling aerosols in the stratosphere, also known as “Chemtrails”. You may remember that Chemtrails were also referred to as “conversion theory” before they were eventually confirmed as another conspiracy case.
325	11	There are also ideas about the “depletion” of sea clouds and the “depletion” of cirrus clouds, of which the climate culture claims that they could prevent the sun from heating the planet too much during the day.
325	13	“In the stratospheric aerosol injection, a aerosol like sulfur dioxide is sprayed into the stratosphere, and since it has the potential to affect the entire world, it often gets the most attention,” CNBC reports.
325	15	“While ethical risk arguments have hindered research efforts, the idea gets more and more attention in the light of the worsening climate crisis.”
325	17	A investment funded by Climate Tech praises Biden for opening the way for more profits from global warming
325	19	The White House’s solar protection program, signed by the false “president” Joe Biden earlier this year, will likely include sprinkling sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, which CNBC itself considers “dangerous to the environment and human health.”
325	21	But it is worth it, at least when it comes to the “scientists and climate defenders” who live in constant fear of things like too hot weather and other alleged “changes” of the climate that make them worried.
325	23	“The reflection of the sunlight has the potential to ensure the maintenance of billions of people, and it is a sign for the White House’s leadership that it advances research so that future decisions can be made on scientific basis and not on the basis of geopolitical currents,” said Chris Sacca, founder of the Climate-Tech Investment Fund Lowercarbon Capital, who benefits from this type of climate misconception.
325	25	Despite the obvious conflict of interest between Sacca’s companies and the agenda of the White House of Biden, Sacca claims that it has “no financial interests beyond philanthropy”.
325	27	According to David Keith, Professor at Harvard University, there has been the idea of blocking the sunlight to stop the global warming, at least since 1965. Only today it will be taken much more seriously than then, probably because society is continuing to be submerged into an absolute foolishness that is controlled by mental-destroyed climate sectors.
325	29	In the same year, a report to the then President Lyndon B. Johnson, entitled “Restoring the Quality of Our Environment” (Restoring the Quality of Our Environment), expressed the idea of sprinking particles over the ocean at a price of $100 per square mile. Based on the dollar rate at that time, it was estimated that the reduction of global temperatures in this way would cost about $500 million a year.
325	31	Not everyone is convinced that blocking the sunlight is the right way, as well as Janos Pasztor, Managing Director of the Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative. He says that “the change of solar radiation will never be a solution to the climate crisis.”
3250	1	The first flight from China landed in Vienna.
3250	3	After the end of the zero-covid policy and almost three years of disarmament, China has reopened its borders to abroad. The first flight from China arrived on Monday morning. The AUA aircraft from Shanghai landed around 6.25 a.m. at Vienna-Schwechat Airport. Due to the strong corona spread in the country, Austria, like many other countries, has introduced a test obligation for travelers from the People's Republic.
3250	5	Passengers must submit a negative PCR test before departure, which may not be older than 48 hours. Almost all passengers were able to show a valid PCR test during check-in and have thus met the governmental requirements, a spokeswoman for the AUA told APA. “Only seven of the 230 passengers were unable to prove the PCR test with the required validity and therefore were unable to start the flight.”
3250	7	Health Minister Johannes Rauch (Greenland) announced the test obligation on Thursday. He was involved in the decisions of several governments around the world. So so, so far, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, France, Spain, Italy, the UK, the US, Israel, Japan and Portugal have declared Corona tests necessary. Morocco even went a step further and banned any entrance from China, regardless of the nationality of the travellers.
3250	9	Currently, a massive corona wave runs through the country. The Chinese health system and the Krematoriums are completely overloaded, according to media reports. The data processor Airfinity, based in London, estimates that 2.5 million people are infected each day in China, with 16600 deaths per day. It is estimated that there have been 209,000 deaths. With such a large outbreak, the emergence of new viral variants is also feared. Many countries, including Austria, test wastewater from aircraft coming from China on new variants.
3250	11	"Smoking is not concerned about an aggravation of the situation in Austria. Unlike China, there is a wide immunity in Austria against the dominant omicron variant in China, he had recently emphasized. Germany is more cautious. The Robert Koch Institute describes China as “a viral variant area where an alarming viral variant is threatened to occur.” The German government also advocates ""not necessary"" travel to the Asian country."
3250	13	Despite the opening, there is no major tour wave from China for now. The number of international flights is still limited, the tickets are very expensive. The Chinese authorities are also planning to issue or renew passports again, but primarily for business and study trips. Until more Chinese arrives again in this country, months will pass, said tourism secretary Susanne Kraus-Winkler (ÖVP).
3250	15	Before the pandemic outbreak in early 2020, Europe was a popular destination for China. According to Eurostat data, Chinese citizens provided more than 22 million nights in the EU in the last year before Corona 2019. In 2019, 1.42 million nights were spent in Austria on Chinese tourists. Approximately a million of them, that is, two-thirds, go to the summer season.
3250	17	The opening of China followed a month after the sudden withdrawal from the strict zero-covid policy. Since the beginning of 2020, Beijing has been trying to become the master of the disease with lockdowns for hundreds of millions, closed cities, mass tests and forced quarantine. After the explosive expansion of new omicron variants, the world’s second-largest economy was increasingly under pressure. Numerous people had protested against the strict measures on which China’s government has its zero tolerance policy on the 7th. December was completely announced.
326	1	"Children's abuse is likely to become official: Stiko wants ""in the near future"" vaccination recommendation for small children"
326	3	The pressure of the pharmaceutical industry must be enormous, so that one has a hurry to make innocent children victims of vaccines, to steal their future and health:
326	5	Following the EU approval of the Corona vaccines for children under the age of five, the Standing Vaccine Commission (Stiko) will quickly give a recommendation to parents and doctors: the Stiko is “currently dealing with a recommendation for the Covid-19 vaccines for children under the age of five,” Commission President Thomas Mertens told the Funke Media Group (Saturday Expenses). Stiko member Fred Zepp added, the Stiko advises on the present study data and takes into account the current infection event in this age group in their decision. “A result is expected in the coming weeks,” said the pediatrist at the University of Mainz.
326	7	The Stiko recommendation for older children between the ages of five and eleven shows this effect, according to Zepp: “Knapp every fourth child between the ages of five and eleven has now been vaccinated against Covid-19 at least once.” “We do not see any high disease burden by the Omicron variant in small children so far,” Zepp said.
326	9	Since many children have already been infected with omicron, he estimates that they are well protected by the combination of single vaccination and infection in this autumn and winter. Children with their own, serious risk factors, on the contrary, should be given up to two upgrading vaccines in addition to complete basic immunization, the pediatrist said.
326	11	Always weaken the immune system in good time so that the little time of their life remains dependent on the pharmaceutical industry. One can only hope that the parents will not participate in this dangerous game with the health of our little ones. Otherwise it has happened to the children. 
327	1	GEW Demands Better Corona Protection Concepts for Schools
327	3	The Union of Education and Science has urged the Federation and countries to improve the Corona protection in schools. “The mantra of the Culture Ministers Conference (KMK) ‘The schools must remain open’ is right, but it is too short,” said GEW chief Maike Finnern to “Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland”.
327	5	"Implementing these goals means that schools support and the health protection of all school participants should be significantly improved: “with prevention and hygiene concepts, but above all with additional staff.” Finnern urged special, multi-professional teams where teachers, social workers, school psychologists and educators work together. Moreover, she demanded more resources and staff from politics, ""so that school in the Corona crisis doesn't run out of the row."""
327	7	"According to Finners, the level of illness among teachers is already high due to various diseases: GEW receives feedback from schools that up to 20 percent of teachers are sick. In addition, classes were to be sent home, and tests could not be written because many students were infected with the coronavirus, the Finns warned. “Teachers must offer the lesson in presence and online.” The Association of Education and Education also focused on the energy crisis. Schools are facing another major uncertainty this year due to the energy crisis, said VBE chief Udo Beckmann to the RND and called for the clarification of open questions: ""We welcome the policy that schools are classified as protective facilities and are preferred even in the case of interference. But the question of how possible energy saving measures and regular ventilation should be harmonised remains unanswered.”"
328	1	“Yes, Russia sells fewer fossil fuels, but because the price has risen, it earns more money with it.” 
328	3	Budapest, Hungary and World Express. “The EU has raised the global problem with its unsuccessful sanctions against Russia, which is actually more harmful to Europe. Yes, Russia sells fewer fossil fuels, but because the price has risen, it earns more money with it. Such an assessment of the effects of the sanctions has not yet been made. So the perception of the conflict in Ukraine from Hungary’s point of view may be different from the EU’s generally accepted point of view.”
328	5	Judit Varga, Minister of Justice in Hungary, told the U.S. magazine National Interest. Worse, the VSA and its Vasal states have directly and indirectly funded the capitalists and fascists in Ukraine and their coup in February 2014. The new regime of Ukraine, which is considered the most corrupt state in Europe, led a civil war and an attack war against the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, to which the Russian Federation (RF) has assisted since the end of 2022.
328	7	The sanctions of the VSA with the UK in the Beiboot and the Vasall states in the EU began with the fascist coup in February 2014. The U.S.A. with its war alliance Atlantic Pact wanted to continue to advance to the Russian Federation in Georgia and Ukraine years earlier, as it did in five phases after the fall of the Iron Curtain and as the Falks announced it at the war alliance meeting in 2008 in Bucharest.
328	9	Since the fascist state strike in February 2014 in Ukraine there have been in the RF heights and depths, but the ruble rolls, raw materials such as oil and gas are sold and the revenue increases.
329	1	Crimes about the explosion of the gas pipelines: puzzle stones slowly give an image - Uncensored
329	3	In the weekend, it was revealed through the sheet forest that Russia is responsible for the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in collaboration with the United States.
329	5	“Invented History”
329	7	The report focused on the fact that London denied. The British Defense Ministry turned the shock and subjected Russia to the destruction of the pipeline:
329	9	To get rid of its catastrophic dealing with the illegal invasion in Ukraine, the Russian Defence Ministry attacks the spread of false claims of an epic extent.
329	11	The “history,” according to which the West, in particular Britain, is responsible for the explosions, is “invented” and “says more about disputes within the Russian government than about the West.”
329	13	Not “in the service of His Majesty”
329	15	But how does Russia find that Britain could have anything to do with the destruction of the gas pipelines? It also went through the forest:
329	17	The phone was heard by former British Prime Minister Liz Truss.
329	19	Agents, “who are suspicious of working for the Kremlin,” may have gained access to “strictly secret talks with international partners.”
329	21	A minute after the explosion.
329	23	What was exchanged? “It’s done,” a minute after the explosion, as no one knew of it. This is the case with the New Zealand hacker Kim Dotcom.
329	25	The message was told by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who called the North Stream explosion a “enormous chance”. “America has become the leading gas supplier for Europe.”
