321	1	Luisa Neubauer: Climate hystery and double morality
321	3	"Her top name was ""Long-Range Luisa"" because she was completely ungenated and walked around the world. But the Fridays-for-Future activist, the master’s favorite child and eternal student, wants to tell us how to drive “in the name of the climate” and whether we can still fly. This is by Thomas Frank in the magazine ""RT DE""."
321	5	Frank says on RT DE: “I’ve been ashamed”
321	7	Luisa Neubauer is Germany’s most famous climate activist. He has been struggling for the salvation of the world for years. The “German Greta” is the main protagonist of the panicing teen movement “Fridays for Future”. As a result, she is desirably “released” in the media.
321	9	In the middle of October 2022, Neubauer was interviewed in the news magazine Der Spiegel. Interesting for me, however, were not their mantramically repeated plattitudes of the near world’s collapse, but the behavior of editor Benjamin Maack, who conducted this interview. He showed ungenerately how far the climate education has already reached the journalists. His statement to New Builder, as if it was the most important thing in the world today:
321	11	"""I had a minicrisis because of my shoes: from the leather! It is not produced sustainably. For a moment I was ashamed.”"
321	13	Newbuilder replied:
321	15	“You don’t have to justify this before me, you have to agree with yourself.”
321	17	"I see imagistically in front of me how the mirror editor probably relieved that ""clima-Luisa"" had just given him a part-absolute. Madness at it’s best!"
321	19	Not much to know and yet surrounded by the media
321	21	A brand of the Friday-for-Future movement is exaggeration and panic. In this sense, Luisa Neubauer also hysterizes. From the “summer heat” that I have felt as “normal” for almost 60 years, for example, it makes it a “deathful heat” and even makes it ready to connect the war with the “climate”. This absurd idea is to come first.
321	23	"In the Spiegel interview, the ""Eternal Student"" said that since 2015(!) He studied geography at Göttinger University and who has never worked in a bread job:"
321	25	“Whoever has the possibility to behave sustainably, I would always encourage him to do so.”
321	27	In the Anne Will show, she was asked how people should actually afford this “climate-friendly” way:
321	29	“What do you say to the people in Lausitz, if they immediately go out of the coal and other power plants are closed?”
321	31	Neubauer’s response was a representative for the prosperous climate youth and a blow to the face of those people who are afraid of their workplace:
321	33	“Climate policy must be social, but should not be prevented because you take something away from people.”
321	35	Let them get unemployed, the main thing we save the earth.
321	37	This is easy to say when you are fed by your parents and don’t have to get up at 6 a.m. every day to go to work. But the non-scientist is hopeful wherever it is possible.
321	39	"Mathias Döpfner, chairman of the Axel Springer SE, invited Neubauer in July 2019 even for dinner in the old-honored journalist club of the Axel-Springer-Hochhaus. He greeted the student with the regrettable words: ""He has not had a free weekend since January, I find it very impressive."""
321	41	"Döpfner wanted to know how he came to Fridays for Future. The ""Scientist"" replied, ""I looked at the scientific facts, it's banal. Climate change threatens humanity.”"
321	43	"In the same year, Neubauer was also invited to a federal press conference with ""real"" climate researchers. This was co-organized by the communication agency ""Laut and Klarlich"". The ""Agency"" is specialized in strategic communication, focusing on social, sustainable and economic issues. Their customers include companies, associations, ministries, startups, foundations and non-governmental organizations."
321	45	"As “references” and those that are “supported”, the agency provides among others: “Fridays for Future”, “Deutschlandstiftung Integration”, “Die Grünen”, “Network Enterprises Integren Flüchtlinge”, “Klima-Allianz Deutschland”, “Scientists for Future”, “European Climate Foundation” and “European Greens”. Therefore, it is not surprising from which ""exe"" new builders are supported."
321	47	“He didn’t hear the shot.”
321	49	I’ve already stated that I’ve never worked yet and still want to tell others how they have to work and how our work world should change. At a climate event, New Builder called for radical changes:
321	51	“We have to start bringing the dramatic situation to the point. We must begin to speak honestly that this change that comes will be drastic, that we demand radical changes, that these changes will affect us all. That we as a society will go through a transformation that we all have not yet experienced. And that it will be uncomfortable. and [...]”
321	53	"At another event, Neubauer apodically spoke of the ""grossest crisis of mankind"": ""We are rushing in the climate crisis with a pace and are repeatedly blown out. For my generation, this is a blow to my face.”"
321	55	At the Country Delegated Conference of the Greens in Bad Windsheim in June 2019, she indirectly represented climate skeptics as “dumb” under applause and featured something of “a couple of older gentlemen”; but read yourself:
321	57	Some say we have 11 years to do something against the climate. That is foolish! We had to do something 40 years ago – we are practically in the minus. And whoever does today as if we had a breath of time to breathe, he has not heard the shot. How could I explain to my children that we did not do that at that time because a few older men were unable to understand that it was time for change. and [...]”
321	59	The Double Moral of “Longstrecken-Luisa”
321	61	"But as many Greens, Luisa Neubauer also has a betrayal double morality. In terms of ""flying"", she said in the Mirror interview mentioned above:"
321	63	“I don’t have to fly to Munich on a date. What a date should be that that is worth all the CO2 so that I can cause it?”
321	65	"What Luisa Neubauer does not say in her talks and interviews, however, is that she was a multiplayer! On YouTube, you could even follow your travel book. Some contemporaries therefore gave her the top name ""Langstrecken-Luisa"". On Instagram you saw them smiling in 2018 in Canada, Hong Kong, Poland, Sweden, England, Morocco, Belgium, China, France, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Namibia, Scotland, Switzerland, Tanzania, skiing in Austria and Italy. How did she come there? Driving on a bicycle, swimming? No, of course not, but with the plane so devastated by the Greens!"
321	67	The Hessic Lower Saxony General wrote:
321	69	“Your Instagram account looks like the one of millions of other young people for whom the world is a home and who like to travel to distant countries. She is also just a man, she says, but today she flies less and feeds mostly vegan. and [...]”
321	71	In the broadcast hard but fair demanded new builders still unmounted:
321	73	“A ban on domestic flights is a matter that should be discussed.”
321	75	Speaking that she was a “multi-flyer,” she said in another event that she “was grew up in a multi-mobile world.”
321	77	"Neubauer himself directed criticism of their own climate-threatening behavior and seemingly spoke out: It is a ""problem"" that is often expected by candidates for a job (especially if they had studied the field of geography) that they could show a lot of overseas stays."
321	79	Newbuilder could and can thus jet around the world, but wants to prohibit us from flying. The Green Double Moral.
321	81	And yet the role of Neubauer seems as clear as that of Greta Thunberg: She also has to prepare us for the “Great Transformation”, the “Great Reset”, that is, the world rule of a political-capitalist elite. But that’s another story...”
3210	1	Sahra Wagenknecht condemns Russian attacks on civil infrastructure
3210	3	Berlin (dpo) - In sharp words, left-wing politician Sahra Wagenknecht today criticized Russian author Vladimir Putin for targeted attacks on civil infrastructure and civilians in Ukraine.
3210	5	“Mr. Putin, this completely meaningless destruction must stop immediately,” Wagenknecht said. “They are very guilty of themselves. The bombardment not only causes innocent people to die, it also threatens an enormous humanitarian crisis if millions have to remain without electricity and heating in the middle of the winter.”
3210	7	"As a member of the anti-war party ""The Left"" it is natural for them to condemn warfare that violates international law. ""And if a state with tens of thousands of soldiers interferes in its neighboring country, bombs it and tries to annex parts of it, then there is no doubt who is guilty,"" Wagenknecht said. The United Nations has clearly stated this in a vote."""
3210	9	If the Kremlin does not immediately stop the bombing of civil infrastructure, it will press the federal government to drastically strengthen the sanctions against Russia.
3211	1	Left as a tenant: trouble in the “taz” paradise
3211	3	The house blessing at Oranienstraße 169 in Berlin Kreuzberg is currently very wrong. The ownership company of the carried out Oldbaus is currently considering the sale to a “investor”. What is actually not a rare thing in Berlin, currently causes in the left circles a severe adjustment.
3211	5	For: Both scared tenants and allegedly unconscious tenants are somehow partially part of the left-alternative daily newspaper (taz). Can it really be that leftists throw their own otherwise so high-righteous principles on board when it comes to the scratched mammon? A terrible suspicion arises.
3211	7	Tax funds dismissed
3211	9	Besagtes Haus in besagtes quite genomgentrifized, left alternatives Berliner Kiez has long belonged to a handful of individuals organized in a GbR. Among them, as the taz himself writes, “a prize-winning journalist.” One of them is the “Taz Panter Foundation”. It was purchased in 1993 for approximately 600,000 euros to be refined with approximately 1.7 million euros from tax funds. By 2017 there was a social connection.
3211	11	However, when the house dropped, it caused rental increases in the house, reports Metin Yilmaz, who works as a press photographer, among other things, for the taz. He no longer understands the world. “They wrote to us that they don’t need to talk to us about it,” says Yilmaz and finds it “a bit arrogant and removed.”
3211	13	No need for conversation
3211	15	However, the owners refuse not only to talk to their tenants, but also to the taz. “More requests from taz to owners remained unanswered, a direct conversation was overwhelmed,” the newspaper writes. Per a taz research in the waiting slope for the vegan crops in the taz Cantine provides more. A shorter service is hardly possible.
3211	17	Rental Yilmaz, whose contract was only orally concluded, plagues almost unexplained fears: “Our horror vision is that we land with an international investor who would probably first withdrew the business rentalers with extreme rental increases,” he tells. The matter is so hard for him that he has already sought the conversation with the “working circle of common welfare” of the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district governed by the Greens. However, he can do nothing.
3211	19	The Kreuzberger Kleinbürger-Krimi has now even reached the Bundestag. Several members of the parliament turned to the owners and took the same export as the rental and the taz. There is no connection under this number. And a few threats are already going. “I’m sure that the reputation of the owners will be sustainably damaged if they keep in their irresponsible attitude,” left-wing parliamentary deputy Pascal Meiser says. But maybe it was just a friendly note among colleagues.
3212	1	Crisis Demonstration: Politics Mobilizes Constitutional Protection
3212	3	of Berlin. Every week, according to official reports, more than 100,000 people in Germany protest against the federal government’s energy, Russia and Corona policies. While climate extremists, blocking streets and destroying artworks, hardly trigger excitement, government politicians now put the constitutional protection against crisis protesters in place.
3212	5	The country’s Ministries of Internal Affairs inform the world on Sunday that “frequently right-wing extremists, ‘governmental citizens’ and ‘state legitimators’ are engaged in the organization of demonstrations.” Accordingly, government politicians in the countries now use their constitutional protection offices against the events, organizers and participants.
3212	7	Constitutional protection is active
3212	9	In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the internal intelligence service is already monitoring the demonstrations. According to the Minister of the Interior Christian Pegel (SPD), the constitutional protection of his country “very likely looks at mobilization out of this environment.” There even the CDU mayor of Stralsund had called for a demo – and raised sharp criticism from the state government that launched a proceedings against him.
3212	11	Turing’s Interior Minister Georg Maier (SPD) founded his action, among other things, by the fact that “members of the AfD” also stood behind the walks and lifts: “These forces want to raise even greater fear to the people.”
3212	13	“A stable core of extremist forces” was also observed in Saxony, says Interior Minister Armin Schuster (CDU): These people were looking for “adhesion to the assemblies.” In this context, the radicals tried to “accumulate or capture assemblies from the bourgeois center also visually.”
3212	15	Police syndicates call for politics
3212	17	With 140,000 people, the police estimates that the majority of people were on the streets until the beginning of October. There are no figures from Bavaria and Hamburg. So it might have been much more. During this time, the large AfD demonstration took place in the Berlin Center. Only there were 10,000 protesters.
3212	19	People's uprisings, which the federal government's politicians such as Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (Greece) warn, have yet expired. But Faeser had already announced in July to prepare for it.
3212	21	"The police unions see the situation differently than the politicians who respond with monitoring measures to the protests. Her federal chairman, Jochen Kopelke, told the newspaper that politicians should better clarify about their actions: “Treet in the direct dialogue. Otherwise, the rats' catchers will scratch you, and democracy will be in serious danger."" "
3213	1	Liberal Thinking Factory Calls for Cursal Change
3213	3	of Berlin. The thought factory Republic21 (R21) has called for a political change in the sense of a “free and open society”. The foundation of this will be threatened by “populist and extremist rights as well as by woke left,” it is said in a R21 manifesto presented on Monday.
3213	5	The initiators of the thought factory are, according to the association, 14 representatives from science, economics and politics. The project is led by the historian Andreas Rödder. It also includes former family minister Kristina Schröder (CDU) and Islam expert Ahmad Mansour.
3213	7	“Both the radical rights and the woke left stand for an identity policy that is not based on individual freedom rights and the principle of the same right for all, but advertising special rights for certain groups – whether it’s ‘official groups’ on the one hand or an ethnicly homogeneous ‘people’ on the other,” they said. Currently, a “polarization of the public” between the radical right and the woke left has not only occurred in the U.S., but also increasingly occurred in Germany.
3213	9	Thought Factory to Defend Liberal Democracy
3213	11	The parties of the civil camp had not only allowed the development from ignorance, disinterest and naivity, but also favoured it. It is now necessary a “new bourgeois policy that takes on the cultural struggle of the identity-political left and identity-right and pulls the enemies of liberal democracy back,” the Manifesto continues.
3213	13	A policy within the meaning of R21 must be committed to “the active self-affirmation of Western democracy and open society.” The fundamental piles are individual freedom and consistent rule of law, equal right for all, freedom of expression and freedom of science, art and press.
3213	15	R21: Germany needs discussion instead of Cancel Culture
3213	17	Germany needs an open discussion culture. Any form of “Cancel Culture” rejects the thought factory. Furthermore, R21 is about eliminating the actual disadvantage of society groups. The general suspicion of “structualized racism” was rejected. Instead of a quota settlement, a comprehensive equal opportunity needs to be created.
3213	19	Financial support should only be available for associations and organizations that are not observed by the constitutional protection. Instead, government-funded groups had to confess to the liberal-democratic basic order. 
3214	1	China's shopping tour continues
3214	3	Just a few days after the cancellor Olaf Scholz's forced approval for the sale of a quarter of the Hamburger Terminal Tollarort comes now the 2nd. The sale of the Dortmunder Halflayer manufacturer Elmos to the Chinese Sai Microelectronics is also approved. A second guest gift that Scholz puts at his congratulatory visit to Beijing at Kotau to the new Emperor of China and will be taken to know with praise.
3214	5	Officially it is said that the technology of the car oil supplier Elmos is obsolete and the Chinese will continue to produce in Dortmund. However, the Chinese do not buy old technologies. They take the blue puzzles and patents, train their engineers on the site, and move after a shame period the main production to China with significantly lower labour, energy, bureaucracy costs and taxes. See the case of the only former German robot-builder Kuka in Augsburg.
3214	7	At that time, the Berlin political committee promised regret and improvement. April and April. As we do not want to get under the wheels with the sale of our half-wheels industry to the Chinese in the increasing chip war between the United States and China, the political genius in the chancellor's office is silent. A huge sargnagel more in the de-industrialization policy of Germany!
3215	1	Making science ridiculous
3215	3	"The times in which Germany was considered the country of researchers and engineers, and the word “scientists” had a fearful sound, are already slowly over. Two-and-a-half years of Corona policy, in which scientists used to how propagandaists appear with Pope's claims of insolvency, and study interruptors with political mandate ""the science"" like a cage before themselves to make other thinkers silent, have already harshed the reputation of the incentive."
3215	5	The next stage of the reputation damage has been introduced by the climate fanatics of an obscured new group called “Scientist Rebellion”: a crowd of climate crabs who hold themselves in the exhibition room of an automotive company and bitterly complain that light and heating come out at night, and there are no hips, drinks and night drinks.
3215	7	9 members of #ScientistRebellion stay clothed in the @Autostadt tonight.
3215	9	Normally, @Volkswagen operates lobbyism in Berlin & Brussels. Today we ask CEO #OliverBlume to do lobby work for the climate. 
3215	11	Scientists with a sudden look
3215	13	However, with the scientific competence of people who do not think about such elementary parameters when planning their action, it cannot be far away. You prefer not to know how it goes in their labs, if they’ve ever seen one from inside. Where the scientific message is to be, when some curved shapes, with a furious look in front of an exhibited sports car on the ground, do not uncover to the non-sect believer.
3215	15	Activists are still activists even if they are surrounded by a white lab. And infantile Klamauk remains infantile Klamauk, who is all nervous and no one is convinced, even if he comes therein in the name of any “science”. If this is the new idea of science in the Green Clown Republic of Germany – then thank you, but no thank you.
3216	1	World Cup in Qatar: Change through cow trade
3216	3	Healthy Human Intelligence Change Through Cow Trade
3216	5	For a long time I had the hope that the World Cup in Qatar would still be broken down. The fact that the corrupt FIFA still comes to mind is that you simply don’t do such a fool. But that was extremely naive. The mafia becomes a men's song union.
3216	7	A short-term cancellation of the tournament would have released me from a moral dilemma. How should I, as a football lover, deal with this world championship? Do I feel guilty when I watch them on TV? I am really interested in the games. On the other hand, I would emphasize FIFA and Co in their assumption that football fans can do anything.
3216	9	Of course, the award of the World Cup to Qatar is one of the foolishest actions in football history, yes, a groundless foolishness. It is likely (as the award of the 2006 World Cup to Germany) to be the result of corruption. It is a climate disaster. This is primarily a human rights disaster. Because of them thousands of workers who built the sports facilities fell to the victims. And because it serves a dictatorship against human rights as a marketing and PR measure that wants to wash itself white with the glow of popular sports.
3216	11	"As the profitable football-functionaries-elite deals with Qatar, Franz Beckenbauer, known in the people's mind as ""Emperor"", has already demonstrated in all beauty early. When he was interviewed after a visit to Qatar on the faults on the buildings and the situation of the working slaves: “So, I have not yet seen a single slave in Qatar. They all run free,” he said. The people there were not attached to chains, nor had they any bottle on their head. Since then, I have no longer called Beckenbauer Emperor, but Emir. For years, the motto was: Nothing to hear, nothing to see. Yet something to say. And casing of course."
3216	13	Others, such as Sigmar Gabriel, the Uli Hoeneß of the SPD, don’t deny all the misconduct in Qatar, but refer to the enormous progress that it is also supposed to have been done due to the World Cup release. Change through cow trade. How effective this procedure is, the last judge of the World Cup has been seen: Vladimir Putin’s Russia.
3216	15	On the other hand, we can already wonder if football fans really need to be more consistent in dealing with the dictatorship in Qatar than, let’s say, the German Vice Chancellor, who, in the hope of liquid gas, even made a bowl before the Emir.
3216	17	As a football fan who is tested in dirty compromises, I am naturally grateful to Habeck. He is almost my Alibi. And when the next time a dictatorship with the world’s largest football party is adultered, I really don’t look at it anymore. Entirely in real.
3217	1	Ricarda Lang warns of RAF comparisons
3217	3	Green Party leader Ricarda Lang has taken the climate group “Last Generation” in protection from comparison with a “climate-RAF”. The Red Army Group (RAF) killed with weapons and explosives, more than 30 people had lost their lives by the terrorists, Lang told the newspaper of the Funke media group. “Whoever pulls parallels here and calls the current protests with the RAF in a breath, shrinks the terror at that time and shrinks the suffering of the victims and the remains,” Lang said, adding that “there is verbal disarmament.”
3217	5	CSU country group chief Alexander Dobrindt had called on in the “Image on Sunday” to prevent the formation of a “climate-RAF”. On Tuesday, Dobrindt confirmed the word choice. The RAF has been considered in the Federal Republic for decades as an involvement of terrorism and murder. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, more than 30 people were killed. Recently, the son of a RAF opper had also spoken with Michael Buback and was concerned about a possible radicalization of the climate protests.
3217	7	The EU faction, however, calls for further penalties against climate activists who block roads or attack artworks in museums. However, stricter laws are not necessary. “For this, our rule of law provides sufficient funds,” she said. However, she criticized the “Last Generation” forms of protest as counterproductive. “When a protest leads to no more talk about the matter, but only about the form of the protest, this proves a bar service,” she said.
3217	9	Green Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann also criticized the “Last Generation” protests as counterproductive. If one chooses a form of protest that leads to the rejection by the majority, it only damages the climate protection goal, the politician said at the “Southwest Press” forum on Tuesday night in Ulm. Civil disobedience must also be free of violence, Kretschmann said. “Protest should not have a change in the matter as a goal, but only the appeal to it.”With the Greens, for example, as part of the federal government, there are a lot of possibilities to change something and get involved.
3217	11	Habeck and Künast on a distance
3217	13	In addition to Kretschmann, the economic minister Habeck had distanced himself from the blockades (“bad and harmful”), as well as Green politician Renate Künast.
3217	15	The 66-year-old indicated the protesters in an indirect interview of lack of effectiveness. “I want us to go on the matter, but we have been discussing for days whether potato bread on artworks is an appropriate form of demonstration,” the 66-year-old told Star magazine. Thus, the group managed to get into the “day show,” Künast said. “But it has changed nothing.”
3218	1	You will be. Well well!
3218	3	The 2,000 people were stuck in the festival hall of the Münchner Hofbräuhause, as on the 24th. In February 1920 the NSDAP was founded. Also on 9. In November 1938, a “gigant business” ruled in the Old Town Hall, as Joseph Goebbels proudly stated in his diary. Everything waited for the minister of propaganda to give an encouragement to the Reichspogromnacht with a short speech. If the untouchable Munich comfort reaches its settlement point, you should be a thousand kilometers away.
3218	5	"When a press conference on “Post-Shoah-Antisemitism” took place recently in the same festival hall of the Old Town Hall in Munich, there was no “gigant business”. Ten journalists lost themselves in the large hall. The Research and Information Centre Antisemitism (RIAS) Bayern presented its latest publication: “Multi-directional attacks on memory” (online available at report-antisemitism.de). On 112 pages, the surprisingly diverse faces of current anti-Semitism (not only in Bavaria) are presented and analyzed – from the yellow star with the title “unvaccinated” to the “post-colonial” anti-Semitism of the Documenta. The longest chapter documented the anti-Jewish attacks in Germany since 1945. It begins with a street battle between at least 1,000 Jewish protesters and the Munich police on the 10th. August of 1949. The wrath of the protesters was directed against a reader's letter of ""Adolf Bleibtreu"", which appeared a day earlier in the ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"", who described the surviving Jews as ""blood-sugarers"" and regretted that ""we haven't lost all."""
3218	7	"The Adolf Bleibtreus of today formulate more subtle. by 50. The anniversary of the Olympia attack in Munich appeared, for example, in the ""Landshuter Zeitung"" readers' letters, which took the gezerre for a compensation for the remaining to finally say again what you will probably be able to say. There is the word of “offering abuse to enrich” or of “the humiliation of the victims by raffering.” Nothing is known about the prosecutors' investigations against readers or publishers."
3219	1	Anti-Wokeness Congress in Berlin: Only Rhetorical Question Signs
3219	3	The Conservative Thinking Factory R21 tries against the left identity policy. There is rational criticism to be heard – but a lot of things go into affective.
3219	5	On the event poster, a face with a large plaque is caught in front of the mouth. “Wokes Germany – Identity policy as a threat to our freedom?” is the title of the related first event of the new liberal-conservative thought factory R 21 on Monday in Berlin. You feel like the plate is called, made mounted by the woken left. The question mark in the title is retorical.
3219	7	The thought factory is not a pure CDU club. It includes the author Ahmad Mansour and the ethnologist Susanne Schröter. But CDU member and historian Andreas Rödder and former family minister Kristina Schröder are two picturesque figures trying to fill the sense vacuum of the Union after 16 years Angela Merkel conservative.
3219	9	According to Rödder, one understands himself “as a bourgeois, democratic center” which warns against right-wing populism as well as against the woke left. One key question, however, is whether the conservative criticism of identity policy holds a sufficient distance to the right-populist enemy determination.
3219	11	As a rather left critic appears on Monday the theaterman Bernd Stegemann, once Sahra Wagenknecht’s counterpart in the failed Rise movement. He criticizes the “progressive neoliberalism” that puts on gender stars rather than on redistribution.
3219	13	“New State Society”
3219	15	“Amazon is free of discrimination and without trade unions,” Stegemann said. The woke capitalism replaces more salary with more recognition. Furthermore, the barrier on the speaker’s position with sacrificed attributes heavens the core of democracy, “the unnecessary force of the better argument” (Habermas) under equals. This is not new, but a rational criticism.
3219	17	FDP politician Linda Teuteberg considers the practice of “deploying people into intrinsic group affiliations and knowing only victims and privileged people” as unliberal. This creates the danger of a “new state society” that is centered on victims groups.
3219	19	Wokeness reads the FDP woman as an expression of a growing “demand for uncertainty” and the inability to tolerate multi-certainty. The latter is always true. Teuteberg formulates her criticism pleasantly relaxed and without lifting protective tombs.
3219	21	Another, much more scary sound is the ex-Bild editor Judith Basad. She had resigned at Springer because the publisher had distanted itself from a text in the world. In this, ARD and ZDF had been attacked because they were allegedly “indoctrinating our children” and being subdued by activists with a “woken” trans-ideology.
3219	23	Almost North Korea
3219	25	It sounds like AfD. Basad, who is currently working in the company of ex-Bild chief Julian Reichelt, indicates the Springer magazine’s retireer as a menetekel. The woke movement is “the greatest danger for our society” and “more powerful than any extreme right movement can be right now,” she says.
3219	27	The Woke movement has captured the main media and built “a tyrannia.” Following this image, we live in a kind of identity policy of North Korea. The cautious insight of the moderator and NZZ editor Alexander Kissler that the image is actually not a central body of Wokeness, spreads to it.
3219	29	Basad's appearance, a lot flattered, stunningly questioned, illuminates a surprising trail of antiwokeness: she repeats in a mirror the victim scene of her enemy. The imagination of living in a totalitarian system that strangulates every freedom and in the “power of the Mobs” (Basad) also conservatory media houses is a kind of echo of some identity policy structures of a comprehensive racist or colonial system.
3219	31	One of the strangers of the Anti-Woken is the ritual proclamation that identity policy is not interested in real life. This stands in an immediate contradiction to the rocky belief that it has to do with an overpowerful enemy.
3219	33	from blase to blase
3219	35	Historic Sandra Kostner testifies to a powerful trend towards the “moralization of science”. As proof of the influence of leftwoker irrationality, she leads the magazine Nature, which recently proclaimed: “Research must do no harm”, research should make a bull on racism, sexism, homofobia and hate speech. Why this should be a serious limitation of scientific freedom remains unclear.
3219	37	Thus, in this event we hear quite cool-rational defences of Republican principles against the claim of identity-political special rights. But some of them go into affection. Critical oppositions were not invited to be cautious. This sometimes leads to the bizarre effect that with a lot of verve woke bluses are attacked – and you actually do it in an anti-woke bluse.
3219	39	Diffus remains whether to prevent the escalation and sharp hostility, as it exists in the United States, as the power of the “democratic center” (Rödder) – or secretly desire for it. Ex-Bild editor Basad believes that a striking anti-woke movement will develop in Germany, including leading figures such as Canadian Professor Jordan Peterson.
3219	41	Learn from Obama
3219	43	Kristina Schröder considers the success of identity policy as a failure of the Union. “Many have thought, that’s so stumbled, that’s going to do itself.” Andreas Rödder finally announces that it will lead a cultural struggle against “moralizing overwhelming.” It sounds like a threat.
3219	45	Former U.S. President Barack Obama once warned the leftist movements in the US: “Don’t be too woke.” More than in R21.
322	1	Accelerate: You’ll experience a very busy journey
322	3	Regular readers of my books and these pages will understand that the financial chaos that sweeps the world and that Britain threatens to send beyond the recession into a deep, dark financial depression and back into the dark economic era, nothing of what is happening is random.
322	5	This is, if you still have doubts, the beginning of the Great Recession, the New Normality, with which the conspirators have been struggling for years.
322	7	(Let’s say there are some unknown collaborators who claim that the “Great Recession” is another conspiracy theory. If you have the right.)
322	9	The upcoming financial chaos has been recorded many years ago.
322	11	When I scored my book in 2012! I wrote, I pointed out: the government can no longer afford to pay the pensions it has promised to the public sector workers. The government cannot afford to pay the state pension. And overall, the policies of the government and the EU have destroyed the attractiveness of private pensions. In one generation, our streets will be full of betrayed English betlers who pray that you give them enough money to eat and buy something.
322	13	Now we are very close to it.
322	15	The current dispute in the UK between the apparently chaotic and devastating government Truss and the apparently incompetent Bank of England prepares us all for a perfect financial armageddon.
322	17	The Bank of England says that our financial problems are caused by the government’s spending policy (what is true). The government says the Bank of England had to raise interest rates faster (which is also true).
322	19	Meanwhile, the British pension funds break down, and millions who had been pleased with an adequate retirement can now look forward to poverty and the need to work until the fall. And the Governor of the Bank is with the Chancellor in Washington. I’m sure you’ll have fun there. Can I suggest you stay there?
322	21	The British pension funds are in a gap because of the double policy of the Bank of England and the new government. But Bailey, who, as the bank's governor, receives more than half a million pounds a year (and who can rightly claim to be the most decently paid Witzbold of the UK), says that the problem is the debt of the pension funds because they do what they are forced to do – that is, to hold government bonds – and that they should fix the chaos. State bonds (including indexed state bonds) have experienced a never-presumed breakdown.
322	23	In these days, a lot of strange things happen. They are all unprecedented and seemingly unexplicable.
322	25	But remember, nothing happens randomly.
322	27	When one first understands what’s going on, it’s remarkable to simply understand how the conspirators drive Britain into a real, deep and lasting depression. The International Monetary Fund says that 2023 will be worse than 2022. And the unanimous opinion is that Britain is in a worse gap than any other country. We are deep in the land of Orwell.
322	29	(Citizens of other countries should not laugh too much. All other countries are also suffering from a financial disaster. The only difference is that the UK will be the first to arrive there.)
322	31	Wherever you look, everywhere you are lying, misleading and misleading.
322	33	The government says the unemployment rate is low.
322	35	But this is just a refined manipulation.
322	37	The fact is that millions of unhappy, innocent young people study at the university to acquire degrees in subjects such as “golf field management”. How many thousand golfers the world needs?
322	39	These unhappy children are at the university only because they do not get into unemployment. (The exams have been significantly simplified to increase the number of students allegedly qualified for further education). They pay a wealth for fees and accommodation (and there are huge debts), and when they finally have their degree, they will have difficulties in finding a job. Most of them will never be able to refund their study credits. Her education will leave her with nothing but happy Saturday night memories and huge, eternal debt.
322	41	And then there are still millions of people seeking social aid. They are, of course, not counted in the unemployment numbers, and their numbers have been increased by the 2 million people suffering from the Happy Furlough syndrome (which is often falsely called “Long Covid” by collaborating, heart-death journalists). These people have the months of paid holidays so much that they don’t want to go to work anymore. And Long Covid (the joy of the hypochonders) has solved “I have back problems, Mr. Doctor” and “I suffer from stress, Mr. Doctor” as the main cause that people are too sick to work.
322	43	The errors who now lead the plant are determined to worsen the situation further by allowing the recipients to increase inflation, rather than limiting them to the salary increases that workers and strikers will receive.
322	45	This will, of course, encourage more millions of people to give up the thought of work and instead join the 2 million people who enjoy the Happy Furlough syndrome.
322	47	Meanwhile, commentators, politicians and journalists desperately try to keep the interest rates low to protect the approximately one million people who have accepted mortgages. Too many have assumed that the absurdly low interest rates are long-lasting – and they have failed to prepare, plan and save.
322	49	No one is curious about the countless millions who have scratched and saved and who now get as well as no interest on their savings. (One day the constantly unmediate banks will have to start making money. They borrow money at 0.1% and borrow it at 6%. Even courageous banks should be able to make money with these numbers.)
322	51	A young writer for a cross-regional publication claimed that the pension crisis is no reason to worry. If you are shortly ahead of retirement, you just have to postpone your retirement for a few years,” the calming council said. And if you’re younger, just pay more money into your retirement to balance the losses.
322	53	Heaven knows what is advised to those who manage their pensions themselves and who, if they were cautious, have lost up to one-third of their pension funds on a day.
322	55	It is clear that in the Great Reset there is no place for self-responsibility. A little grain for the wet, difficult years to go away is money waste.
322	57	The government does not want the people to do that. She wants everyone to depend on her. This is why social benefits are increased. That’s why the government is spending money that it doesn’t have, in the form of energy limitations and massive contributions to.
322	59	The government does not want you to be independent. She wants to control you and everything you do. In their new world, independence is a wicked concept.
322	61	The release was part of control. The energy limits are part of control. The low interest rates (most below inflation) are part of control.
322	63	They want us to feel “righted” and “dependent” – and under their control.
322	65	What is happening in the United Kingdom is happening everywhere. The U.S. has made massive rescue actions.
322	67	If the energy prices continue to rise (what will happen as long as the crazy sectorers spread the myth of global warming and as long as the sanctions against Russia areined), the state debt will continue to rise.
322	69	To survive without being “buy” by the tricks of the conspirators, we have to cut our spending, stretch the belt and avoid buying large household assets. Now it’s not time to buy a new house, a new car or a new sofa.
322	71	Look at your pension and be ready to change your expectations. It may be that you are no longer able to retire as you planned.
322	73	Disbelieve the government, avoid the mass media and defend yourself against lies.
322	75	And please share this article with everyone you know.
322	77	I apologize for the lack of videos. Apart from the copies that still exist, all the original of my videos have been banned, censored or hacked and seem to have disappeared. It's dark and difficult times, and I'm afraid they'll become darker and more difficult.
3220	1	Hot party in the climate club
3220	3	Hunger due to extreme droughts, thousands of deaths after floods, melting glaciers, rising sea levels: the reports of the climate crisis and its consequences are not only increasing, but also increasing dramatic. But the message that humanity is “on the highway to the climate hell with the foot on the gas pedal,” as UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Monday to the opening of the World Climate Conference COP 27 in Sharm al-Sheikh, Egypt, is unlikely to come to the heads of state and government. Especially not those from the global north – that is, the main causes of the climate disaster.
3220	5	For example, the BRD. Instead of making concrete announcements in the fight against the global warming, Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz on Tuesday in Sharm Al-Scheich just for his idea of a “global climate club”. He urged all countries around the world to participate in this, without explaining exactly why such a “climate club” is necessary to implement climate and environmental protection.
3220	7	"Scholz also warned of a “Renaissance of fossil energies,” which triggered intense criticism among climate defenders and environmental associations. “It’s not the first time he does this,” said Till Groth, an expert in international climate policy at the Federation for Environment and Conservation (BUND), on Tuesday. “In July, this formulation was surprising, but months ago, for example, with the then Colombian president, he had already explored the possibilities for an increased import of coal to Germany,” Groth said. In addition to the prolonged flow of coal and nuclear energy in Germany, the talks on the expansion of gas supply in Africa are a strong warning signal, he continued. ""Scholz is not only opposed in its policy, but would further burn the global climate crisis with the further expansion of fossil energies,"" Groth said."
3220	9	The theme at the COP 27 on Tuesday was also the aid needed by the global south to protect the climate. This referred to a study published on the same day to approximately $2.4 trillion per year by 2030. Financing is needed to reduce emissions, increase resilience, address damage caused by climate change and restore nature and land, the conference’s organizers ordered study says.
3220	11	It’s a “happy promise” that Scholz has promised €170 million for a global risk protection screen, BUND expert Groth said. But the amount is “too small.”
3220	13	The fact that the COP 27 will not take decisive measures against the climate crisis, Helge Peukert is not surprised. “If nothing has happened at 26 conferences before, why should it work at the 27th?” asked the professor of Plural Economics at the University of Victory in a conversation with the newspaper. Asked why the COP 27 was condemned to fail, he replied: “In the short term, tens of thousands of people from many countries are invited and declared as climate representatives. States that do not participate have benefits. Everything that is decided is unbinding, and if you get out of the treaties after the conference, then that’s not a problem – it can’t work!”
3221	1	Time goes off
3221	3	Dirty words were the words that Admiral Charles A. Richard, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, said in the middle of last week and who are now on the way through some U.S. military platforms also find the way in the news media. The Ukrainian war? It’s just “the upheating phase,” Richard oracleed. “The great thing,” means the conflict between the United States and China, is coming closer now, and it will probably take a short time, “until we stand before the trials that we have long failed to stand before.” How the conflict is shrinking in detail, what “examinations” therefore will be exactly, Richard did not let himself out of it. His Strategic Command does nothing less than the U.S. nuclear forces.
3221	5	"Warnings from a large, nuclear escalating war between the United States and China have been in the United States for years. Former NATO commander James Stavridis has described such a war to trigger a broad debate, in a novel published in early 2021 he called ""2034"". He has been criticized by military colleagues in view of the title: War is likely to start significantly earlier, some said – in 2026, in 2024. Earlier in August, the Wall Street Journal published a long post entitled “The upcoming war around Taiwan” – without any questioning. That the danger of war is very real, there is no illusion about it in the U.S. political establishment."
3221	7	What made Richard’s statements not a little disappointed was exactly something different. When he looks at “the level of our afraid to China,” the U.S. Admiral said, then he comes to the conclusion: “The ship falls so slowly.” The once believed U.S. advance on military territory – it shrinked there at a high speed. In the submarine capabilities, the U.S. military continued to clearly have the nose ahead, but otherwise hardly yet. It is now necessary to quickly break the row in arms.
3221	9	What about the statements of the Admiral? Now, the so-called War Games in Washington have repeatedly suggested for years that the United States could no longer win a war against the People's Republic. In certain types of weapons, such as hyperscalled missiles, China is already in the forefront today. The fact that Richard demands a higher pace in deforestation is his job. Only: Whoever considers a great war as likely, maybe even unavoidable – and so many in Washington do – will look for it at a time at which he is at least partially military overlooking. If Richard is right, then this is not the case in the United States for a long time. The time to decide the hot power struggle for the global hegemony is coming closer.
3222	1	Climate Change: Can the individual really make a difference?
3222	3	You should not use plastic clothes. You should not eat avocado. You shouldn’t fly to Mallorca!!! What sounds like output from the Ten Commandments for the Rescue of the Climate is actually perceived by many people as well: they try to fix their lives on it. What in many cases causes them to feel bad when they fail.
3222	5	But is that true at all? Would the climate change really stop if all people had abandoned plastic bags and switched to ecosystem? How large is the scope of individual action? And where does the state have to run, and the policy to push systemic changes? We have listed for the areas of transport, energy, agriculture, housing and industry in Germany how many individual life and consumer decisions can be made. And where our area of influence ends as individuals and the state has to take over.
3222	7	The light is shut down, or the power plant?
3222	9	The number one cause of greenhouse gases in Germany is the energy industry: for this, all those emissions that power plants cause when they produce electricity and heat are counted. If there is coal, gas, or oil burned there, CO2 will be produced, any amount of which: 222 million tons in 2020.
3222	11	If we switch to renewable energy, we avoid emissions: Last year, renewables covered 42 percent of electricity production in Germany and 16.5 percent of heat production.
3222	13	What can each individual do to make the energy sector free of emissions? Of course, the thing seems to be on the hand: switching to an ecosystem provider. For a provider with the Ok-Power label or the Green-Strom label, this will bring at least a little bit of something. These power suppliers actively promote the energy transition. But it is far from enough. Approximately half of the electricity in Germany is consumed by the industry, households around a quarter. Let’s assume that every person in Germany would switch to an ecosystem provider. And that would also mean that because of our contract, more ecosystem is actually produced, which is often not the case so far. Even then, industry, business, trade and services would still be responsible for three-quarters of electricity consumption. First of all, the system needs to be fundamentally changed.
3222	15	Our energy consumption will increase in the future. Cars are designed to drive electric, heat pumps heat our houses, and green hydrogen, produced with renewables, is intended to be available as fuel for the industry. The Think-Tank Agora Energy Transition predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2045.
3222	17	In order for this electricity to be renewable, we need not only a massive expansion of wind and solar energy. We also need storage options because it’s not always windy or sunny, and an improved electricity exchange within Europe. In addition, we need to use the existing electricity more intelligently – so for example, the industry consumes a lot of electricity especially when there is just a lot of electricity there.
3222	19	Of course, everyone and every individual can and should save electricity by switching off the light out or the stand-by mode of the TV: According to the non-profit consulting company co2online, we could save more than 15 million tons of CO2 if all private households in Germany would fully exploit their power potential. This sounds like a lot, but it is only 7 percent of what the energy industry has caused in 2020. So whoever has the choice to exchange all the lamps through energy-saving lamps for a afternoon or to go on the street – yes, he should probably prefer to touch the poster and the triller pipe.
3222	21	Internal flights are no matter. How to please?
3222	23	Per the emergence of the term “flight sham” marks that moment as the discussion of the climate harmfulness of our mobility has become entirely moral: What, you are flying yet?!? Or vice versa: What, you want to make the people get their well-worth holidays in Mallorca?!? Here is a proposal for dismissal.
3222	25	The transport sector within Germany – thus first without international flights and ships – accounts for one-fifth of the national greenhouse gases. About 60 percent of these emissions are caused by cars – domestic flights only 1.4 percent. The aircraft is the most dangerous means of transport. But because we drive so many cars in the country and fly so little, the flights hardly fall into weight.
3222	27	Per this is why the area of traffic is so morally charged because the scope for individual decisions seems to be high here – eventually everyone decides whether to sit in the car for his way to work or on a bicycle. In 2020, 68 percent of people answered this question with the key to the car. But: Whoever has any alternatives available, we as individuals cannot influence it at all. Well-built bicycle routes and reliable public transportation can only plan, expand, finance municipalities and the state.
3222	29	But now let’s look at all the emissions associated with mobility of people in Germany, including travel abroad, then flights cause 27 percent – the majority of flights abroad. A little less than one-third of the flights are professional, two-thirds make private or holiday trips. Therefore, the individuals have a big hole.
3222	31	If all people in Germany would stop flying, we could save about 60 million tons of greenhouse gas, about as much as the entire agriculture! However, we would probably then use other means of transport to go on holiday – this would reduce the savings again.
