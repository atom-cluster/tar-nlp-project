22104	1	Working struggle against Amazon: The Invisible of the Second Series
22104	3	Relations on Amazon’s working conditions will quickly become reports in this country as from a catastrophic area: poor exploited picker, packer and package-by-house-bringer tell – mostly pixeled – of apps that keep one in constant monitoring, of timely contracts, of chefs on the longer heels, of being delivered, of the desire to find another job.
22104	5	What is lost in such scandal reporting is the ongoing struggles against the circumstances. These will all be publicly visible when it will be spread again at one of the major Amazon logistics centers, in Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig or in Brieselang. It is often, several times a year, for almost a decade.
22104	7	The struggle for a tariff agreement, against constantly increasing pressure is impressive, the resilience of the employees is unique. Although there is still no tariff agreement, the persistence has been paid for the employees: higher wages and better working conditions are the Group’s concessions.
22104	9	Protests are almost not.
22104	11	But what about those who in the work process come to the big logistics centers that are further down in the hierarchy? For those of the last miles who work in the smaller distribution centers or bring hundreds of packages a day to the doors? There is also resistance. However, it is largely invisible. Package suppliers repeatedly tell of colleagues who don’t like everything from the subcontractors with whom they are employed. Returned wages are recovered on their own.
22104	13	There is collective resistance when suppliers of a subsidiary go into the spontaneous strike and protest the packages before the Amazon camp to pay attention to the fact that not the subcontractor alone is responsible, but also the group that benefits from the subcontractor system. Such protests are never – even because no one is aware of such actions. In the Lower Saxony Wunstorf there will now even be an operating council in one of the small distribution centers. There, the Verdi list won six of the nine seats in the operating council election, even because the Verdi trade union has recognized that not only the employees need to be organized in the major logistics centers.
22104	15	Per there will soon be fewer catastrophic reports and more reports on how human exploitation is challenged.
22106	1	CO2 compensation does not solve the problem.
22106	2	Sustainable and fair travel does not mean having to give up on flights. It requires to deal with politics. How Ethical Travel Successes 
22106	4	More and more people question their own role as tourists and want to make their holidays more environmentally and socially tolerant. But ethical travel – how do you do it? Jon Andrea Florin explains why you should look at the websites of hotels and what questions you should ask before traveling to authoritarian countries.
22106	6	The pandemic, the flood catastrophe, Fridays for Future – the events of the past years have also raised us awareness of the ecological traces we leave with our holidays. Have you made us better travellers?
22106	8	Jon Andrea Florin: We don't know that yet, we lack the data for that. But what we know is that more and more people say they want to travel more sustainably. There are a lot of surveys. For Germany there is the travel analysis of the research community holiday and travel. Every year they ask the Germans, even if they want to travel more sustainably. In environmentally sustainable travel, the values increased from 42% to 47% from 2019 to 2022 and in socially sustainable travel from 51% to 64%. This is a big jump.
22106	10	Time Online: Is the Age of Ethical Tourism Coming? 
22106	12	Florin: I am skeptical. Because in the holidays you also want to make holidays from over-I to formulate it psychoanalytically. People want to take a vacation from moral concepts and conscience, leaving all external and internal constraints behind them. That’s why I don’t believe that the vast majority will pay attention to ethical components and instead continue to travel as before.
22106	14	Time Online: Popular cities like Barcelona have almost as many visitors as before the pandemic. The inhabitants plagued by overtourism have imagined it differently. Is it still affordable to travel to Barcelona, Venice or Paris?
22106	16	Florin: Yes, that is still representative. However, some things should be taken into account. Let’s take Venice: You should not stay in the center and only travel in the subseason that is in Venice from November to February. If you then take holidays with the locals and the local guides also show historic places that you don’t get to see at a standard city tour, then the locals get a good income. 
22106	18	Time Online: That’s what you need. Because they have to pay higher rent because the many Airbnbs drive the prices up and get their living room.
22106	20	Florin: Travellers can search for offers at Fairbnb, which is a combination of tenants who live their apartments themselves and rent only when they just don’t need them. Airbnb is a good example of how a nice idea can be perverted. In Paris, 60,000 apartments were rented via Airbnb. This has led to the rise of rent so that the Parisers themselves cannot live there anymore. As a user at Airbnb, you can see very well whether someone offers two or three apartments or only one that he then probably uses himself. I think you can stay there.
22106	22	Time Online: What about traveling in dictatorships and autocracies? 
22106	24	Florin: Keeping the tourists away, it can help people get poor and then get straight behind an autocratic leader. In the Philippines, for example, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was elected a son of a dictator whose father was famous for corruption and human rights violations. Tourism has completely broken down due to Corona and this has aggravated the Philippine economic crisis. 
22106	26	Time Online: Which Countries Are Tabu?
22106	28	Florin: I’m sure North Korea, but I’d avoid Myanmar with a heavy heart. For these countries will not be able to get in contact with the people. No one who is not directed by the government. And of course now Russia, although I see it twistedly. If you get acquainted there and go to people you know, to whom you want to show that there is another way of view, if you feel that you can overcome it, then I’t advise from traveling to Russia. 
22106	30	Time Online: Another factor is the resource consumption in tourism. A room in a 5-star hotel in Indian Goa consumes approximately 1,785 liters of water per day.
22106	32	Florin: There is a simple formula to focus on: the higher the number of stars at the hotel, the higher the resource consumption. You can find out on the hotel’s website what sustainability initiatives it has. If there is nothing, you can assume that the operators do not worry. If there is a small end note on sustainability, then they may only exchange the towels on demand. 
22106	34	Time Online: On your website you write, there are more than a hundred sustainability labels in tourism. How can I recognize serious labels and greenwashing?
22106	36	The easiest thing is to build on certificates. There are now some booking platforms that offer certified travel and accommodation. New are Fairway and Ecohotels; Forum Other travel and We are elsewhere there has been for a long time. You can also consult the label manager on our website or look through at Tourism Watch. Together we give recommendations on which certificates we consider to be serious. Sustainability standards are awarded by independent, external certification companies.
22106	38	Time Online: Considering the fact that we contribute to climate change with every flight: Is the claim to want to travel ethically not just mental greenwashing before itself?
22106	40	Florin: A good question! No, definitely not. We always leave an ecological trace, no matter what we do. And if I decide to fly only once every five years, then it is better than nothing at all. We have set five criteria to pay attention when traveling. We call this the FUCK formula: G as comfortable travel, i.e. by foot, by bicycle or by train. Prefer local offers. It’s like being willing to be surprising and not to shut down the “101 places you have to have seen.” C as CO2 decreases by flying less or compensating flight. How to pay the correct prices. 
22106	42	Time Online: Do you mean taking distance from cheap offers?
22106	44	Florin: The working conditions in tourism are often very difficult. Not just cheap flights. Also on cruise ships, many people work ten, twelve, 14 hours in the room or in the kitchen under the most miserable conditions. Others fell in existence disasters, the guides in the Himalayas about. Tourists can see on booking platforms where they get the cheapest offer and then book there. This causes suppliers to lower prices. So there is a price spiral down and the guides can no longer live from their work.
22106	46	Time Online: Compensation is controversial among the environmental guardians. Is it a means against air scam rather than an effective measure?
22106	48	Florin: Of course, compensation is just a plate. The problem does not solve it. But it is better than nothing. We say: If you don’t come to a place other than by plane, then you should at least compensate – and it’s best not to the cheapest way. 
22107	1	Comeback for Climate Change
22107	3	Coal power plants will replace many gas power plants in the BRD. For this, the Bundestag gave green light on Thursday evening and the Federal Council on Friday morning. Economic Minister Robert Habeck (Alliance 90/The Greens) declared in the House of Nations that it is a “climapolitical retreat” that more coal power plants would be used for electricity instead of gas. This is needed to reduce gas consumption.
22107	5	The decision is based on the gas crisis caused by the economic war against Moscow. For several weeks, the BRD and other European countries have had to deal with lower gas supplies from Russia. The fault is the repair work on a gas turbine of the Pipeline Nord Stream 1, which cannot be completed due to the Western sanctions. According to the federal government on Friday, it has now received “positive signals” from the Canadian government that the Siemens Energy turbine is being delivered for North Stream 1. From Monday, the pipeline will then be closed for maintenance for ten days. After that, gas supplies to Europe will be increased again, Moscow assures.
22107	7	However, the federal government wants to become independent from Russian energy suppliers as soon as possible. In addition to liquid gas from Qatar and the U.S., there will be an increased use of coal energy. This, however, is contrary to the promises made by the Greens before they came to the government. So that she had to explain in the Bundestag now why her party decided the comeback of the climate cylinder coal power, Kathrin Henneberger probably couldn’t imagine a few months ago. In their speech, the Greens attempted to sell the “Law on the preparation of power plants” as a “big success”. In view of a criticized Colombian agenda that supplies BRD with coal, Henneberger said: It will ensure that the decision does not further promote the coal industry in Colombia. This will be “parliamentary.” In addition, it is intended “to promote that we, precisely with these countries, also enter into energy transition partnerships and bring together the change: out of the coal, to the renewable,” Henneberger said.
22107	9	Ralph Leader, the energy and climate policy spokesman of the Left Party in the Bundestag, said in his speech that the left party will agree to the law because the lamp has improved its draft. Many people today will be afraid of the next energy calculation. “Without natural gas, cold houses are threatened, food – even bread – could become short.” gas, electricity and heat should remain affordable, employment and income of the workers should be secure, the left-wing politician said.
22107	11	Oliver Powalla, a spokesman for energy and climate at the Federation for Environment and Nature Conservation Germany (BUND), warned on Friday to the young world that the stressed situation on the energy markets may not be a freedom to mobilize and use additional fossil energies. “The federal government must react carefully to threatening supply losses and, through binding energy savings, ensure that coal power plants are not operated as far as possible,” Powalla said.
22107	13	Havec’s coal plan is open. For example, the power plant operator Leag currently sees “unbeatable barriers” for its brown power plant in Jänschwalde, Brandenburg, as a group spokesman dpa on Friday. This is about emission requirements. Since these requirements for the power plant blocks in safety preparation could not be met in the necessary time, the Federation must make an exception for the brown coal. “If we are to be available in the autumn, we won’t get it without exceptional permission.”A technical rebuilding of the power plants is not to be created until the autumn.

22107	21	- Reader letter by online subscriber/in Dieter R. from Nuremberg ( 9. July 2022 at 07:40)Yes, in the light of the initiated economic and political shrinking, the Green War fighters are now in panic throwing all environmental ambitions on board. However, the trigger for the “Climaciller’s Comeback” is not the Ukrainian war, as it is falsely said in the title. Responsible for the rising catastrophic effects are rather the advanced aggressive decisions and actions of the Western decision makers such as NATO Eastern expansion, the preventing of the North Stream 2, extreme high equipment, weapons delivery to Ukraine and, of course, the self-destructive blind sanctions organs. Whoever leads the unprecedented “total war” against Russia at all levels and with all means is guilty alone of the expected consequences. The war on Ukraine is not a trigger, but a consequence of the Western confrontation strategy.

22108	3	The attempt of the United States and its allies to force Russia with sanctions against oil, gas and coal exports leads “the inflation to heights that have not been observed for decades.” The fact is obvious. The quote is from a statement from the G7 summit held in Bavaria earlier last week. The fact that the leading politicians of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan do not put the cause of misery in their own policies, but in “Putin’s war” is on hand.
22108	5	At the G7 meeting, which included Russia from 1998 to 2014, the G8 decided to look for ways to control and limit oil prices through the formation of a consumer cartel. This will reduce Russia’s revenue in order to “drive and keep the economic and political costs for President Putin and his regime high,” Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. “It will require a lot of work,” Scholz said. Finally, it is not only that the industrial countries of the West must agree – what they are not so far – but it is also necessary to bring the large consumers of Russian oil such as China and India to join this policy. To this, the most affordable mix of threats and promises, punishments and rewards is discussed.
22108	7	In the previous discussions, technical compulsory measures are at the forefront. Tank transport requires shipping insurance and loans. The financial centers of the West still play a role. One idea is to bind both to the fact that a certain purchase price of the transported oil should not be exceeded. This, however, requires accurate knowledge of the contracts and thus also extensive cooperation willingness of Russian customers.
22108	9	If this was easy, the G7 would not have to talk about it four and a half months after the war in Ukraine began. Washington’s finance minister, Janet Yellen, said earlier in June that the U.S. government is “extremely active” discussions with European countries to find more ways to limit Russian oil revenues.
22108	11	With the same goals, the US and the EU are also trying to force the price of Russian natural gas down. Until now, however, only the consequences for the economy and the social situation of the majority of the population in the West are negative and make catastrophic consequences in the winter fear.
22108	13	Klaus Ernst of the party The Left, which leads the chairman of the Bundestag Committee on Climate Protection and Energy, on Wednesday in an interview with the Rheinischen Post proposed to correct the “fullly failed” sanctions policy and to talk to Russia about a temporary entry into operation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. He was subsequently attacked by party leaders Janine Wissler and Martin Schirdewan and co-chairman Dietmar Bartsch. But while the capitalists in their media discuss intense advantages and disadvantages of possible measures, Ernst’s opponents only dogmatically call on their interpretation of the party’s resolution, instead of presenting factual arguments.
22108	15	The price for a barrel Brent was slightly below $112 on Thursday afternoon. After he reached a maximum of $139 in a very short time in March, he has spent a few weeks on average between $100 and $115. This is still exceptionally high: for the first half of the year, an average price is $103.76, compared to $70.68 in the previous year and $41.96 in the first coronary year 2020. To find an average price like today, you need to go back until 2013. The background is clear: there is no free capacity anywhere. These are very bad conditions for a customer card.

22110	1	Part of State Policy
22110	3	The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, has recently fallen into a scandal about the rehabilitation of the Ukrainian version of fascism. The head of the Polish Defence Ministry, Mariusz Blaszczak, called the ambassador now withdrawn from Kiev last Wednesday a “beneficial Kremlin idiot,” after the diplomat named the Nazi laborator Stepan Bandera as “Robin Hood” and “the personification of the freedom struggle”.
22110	5	The German-Polish historian Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe had already reminded in May to the English service of the German Wave that “Bandera of course wanted an Ukrainian state, but he wanted a fascist state, an authoritarian state, one in which he would have been the leader.” Melnyk, however, seems to be unhappy this time too. In the best case, he will receive a promotion in the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, because when criticized the Ukrainian neonazi and radical nationalists, there is hardly an ideological basis for the fight against prosovjetic feelings.
22110	7	However, both Ukrainian politicians and Western allies often prefer to play, as in this case it is difficult to conduct a consistent information policy. For if, on the one hand, there is a rehabilitation of fascism in Ukraine, then the formal justification for the Russian intervention is at least not without meaning. On the other hand, Ukrainian politicians and officials themselves give out these tricks by praising the organization of Ukrainian nationalists with its military wing (OUN/UPA) and bandera. This has not even become an outlook, but has become part of the state policy. Banderas followers travel through the capital Kiev every year on his birthday with a fackel train. In 2016, the capital changed the name of the Moscow- in Bandera prospectus. On the positions of the Ukrainian troops, alongside the national flags, the black-red UPA flags can be seen everywhere.
22110	9	The problem with the rehabilitation of fascism in its Ukrainian version, however, is that one must constantly blurry. Even students and households will be encouraged to be hypocrites by shining Bandera for a liberal western audience, but glorifying its business for a fair and nationalist audience. First you need to identify the partner. The skilled use of such doubless is supposed to help save the lives of the spouses and children of Ukrainian students who are trapped into the army.
22110	11	The logic is as follows: the condemnation of the crimes of the UN/UPA can lead to a rebellion of neonazists and nationalist paramilitary in the midst of the hostilities – an unexpected glorification of the reduction of the financial support by the Western liberal society. Another manipulative instrument for the rehabilitation of fascism is the reference to the “struggle for the nation.” In Ukrainian national ideology, since 2014, the concept of the “Ukraine” as a representative of an ethnic group has been replaced by the concept of the “Ukraine” as a supporter of a radical nationalism. From this perspective, the struggle against fascism becomes a struggle against all Ukrainians, as against a people.
22110	13	But it also sweats western liberal politicians and often refer to the figure of the president. However, Wolodimir Selensky is a nominal and transitional figure, while the rehabilitation of Ukrainian fascism is a long-term policy that is more justified by geopolitical interests from the outside. From the pragmatic perspective of the Ukrainian nationalists and neonazists, Selensky only contributes to disappointing some theses of Russian propaganda, which in turn contributes to the flow of money and weapons to Ukraine for their long-term goals.
22110	15	And the fact that Russia uses the anti-fascist rhetoric of de-nazification for its own pragmatic purposes cannot justify the defense or rehabilitation of Ukrainian fascism and radical nationalism.

22116	1	The endless farce of U.S. sanctions against Russia
22116	3	by Joseph Solis-Mullen – http://www.antikrieg.com
22116	5	Instead of pursue diplomatic efforts for a solution to the civil war in Ukraine, whose dissolution it was significantly involved (by supporting the unconstitutional change of power in that country in 2014), the Biden government, in the months before the Russian invasion in February, pursue an intense effort to impose “extreme” economic sanctions.
22116	7	The threat of such additional sanctions, since Washington had already imposed a series of sanctions in 2014, should allegedly hinder the invasion. After this failed, it was claimed that the sanctions would force Russia to the negotiation table.
22116	9	This also clearly failed.
22116	11	Given the central importance of economic warfare for Washington’s foreign policy, it is worth exploring how the Kremlin has managed to keep the Russian economy over water since the invasion of Ukraine, and what further effects this could have and how it may be applied to China in the future.
22116	13	First, the immediate collapse of the ruble was stopped by the actions of the Russian Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. While the first interest rates almost doubled overnight, the latter began to spend their accumulated reserves to balance the price inflation that the purchasing power of Russian consumers began to eat. Although Washington and its Vassal allies have left almost half of their foreign exchange reserves in Moscow, it has used its record excess in the payment balance to compensate for the temporary loss.
22116	15	This balance sheet, which is the result of continued sales of oil and gas at lower amounts but higher prices while imports declined drastically, has mild the effects of domestic inflation, which is currently around 17 percent, but could not prevent the economic growth in Russia from declining drastically (for the next year is now expected a decline of about 10 percent).
22116	17	Since the governments from Washington to London, Warsaw and Vilnius have made it clear that they do not encourage an abolition of the sanctions even in the event of an end to hostilities, Russia’s future growth is likely to be far behind what it would have been otherwise. As Russia has no access to Western capital and Western technology, it will become increasingly dependent on China, India or other developing economies when it comes to imports, but also when it comes to finding customers for its energy exports, as a large part of Europe wants to drastically reduce or completely eliminate its dependence on Russian hydrocarbons.
22116	19	Therefore, on the long run, there is little doubt that the current sanctions will weaken and make Russia poor. Of course, the Russian people, just like now, will bear the costs of the financial war of the West – and not its leadership.
22116	21	As usual, we must believe that the people in the countries affected by the U.S. economic war will blame their own government and not Washington – that they may even dismiss Vladimir Putin and welcome the West! Except that this from Cuba to Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, etc. Never worked, Anne Williamson explained twenty years ago that it is highly unlikely that the Russians will blame their government for their misery, considering that the last time Russia invoked the West, people like Jeffrey Sachs, Larry Summers and Paul Rubin destroyed the economy and transferred it to oligarchs, of which they eventually hoped that they would forward it to Western multinational companies.
22116	23	Of course, the Russian people are not alone with their current poverty. Even ordinary people around the world are becoming poorer and weaker by Washington’s policy. While Europeans keep their savings empty in the light of record-high gas, oil and food prices, many people in developing countries will literally die of hunger long before the war in Ukraine ends – which, according to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, may take years.
22116	25	That this policy is equally admired by Democrats and Republicans is not surprising: American Democrats are madly full of hate to Russia because they can’t accept that Hillary Clinton has failed to beat Donald Trump, while Republicans like Ted Cruz are committed to mercantilist interests, i.e. U.S. oil and natural gas producers who want to sell to Europe. In the first case, although Russia has intentionally tried to interfere, it has not taken a proven influence on the elections, which even the established economist acknowledges; in the second case, the U.S. gas and oil exports are already rising to a ever-time high.
22116	27	As a demonstration of his ability to force others to comply with his policies and let his own people carry the consequences, Washington has undoubtedly managed to send the ambassador he intended to Beijing through Taiwan. While Washington’s weapons of the global financial system has undoubtedly alarmed the planers of the Communist Party of China, the fact that its own population would be quite willing to suffer for the reunification of its country, as well as the fact that many countries in developing countries have avoided to follow the example of the West, a lot of reason to doubt the effectiveness of threatening sanctions as a disruption in the event of another, greater crisis on the street of Taiwan.
22116	29	This, however, does not prevent the Atlantic Council employees from dreaming of it in front of a NATO summit, which focuses on sailing races in Beijing.
22116	31	For what does a story of failure and mass degradation prove, if not, that the next time it will be different?
22116	33	If only Karl Marx had been right, when he said in reference to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel that history repeats itself, first as a tragedy, then as a farce. The truth seems rather that we are condemned to suffer an unfinished Farcen parade if Washington continues to pursue a proven failed and immoral policy.

22130	1	The world’s largest sponsors of imperial power call for the “decolonization” of Russia
22130	3	Until the 23th. In June, a U.S. Congress-funded organization – the Commission for Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission – hosted a virtual conference calling for “Russia’s decolonization”. This raises the question why the United States has not long been pursuing the de-colonialization. Finally, this nation was literally founded by the successors of white colonists, who had to first cross a ocean to then force this territory to the indigenous.
22130	5	While the speakers of the conference, which can be heard here, took the current crisis in Ukraine as a starting point, they called for the Russian Federation for a “decolonization” of regions and republics that – like Siberia and Tatarstan – since the 16th century. century or – such as Czech Republic – since the early 19th century. It is a century ruled by Moscow.
22130	7	Such a claim would be equivalent to the call to the United States to give up its entire territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific, not to mention new annexes, such as Hawaii, which was only in 1959 a full state of the United States. When one of the conference participants asked how the U.S. should deal with the topic of Hawaii in the light of this discussion on a “descolonialization of Russia”, the podium speakers swallowed around this question and immediately changed the topic to ultimately only prove that one really didn’t want to deal so much with a “descolonialization” but actually more interested in dividing the Russian Federation into parts.
22130	9	"The speakers of the conference concentrated strongly on ""Russia"" in the Soviet time, although the other Soviet republics they mentioned long before the 1917 revolution were already part of the Zarist Russia. If at all, the USSR granted all these territories more independence than they had ever before. The ghost of rafting the Soviet Union and mixing it with today’s Russia is the standard fence, each used to raise hysteria against Moscow as a kind of imperial power that allegedly tries to conquer the world."
22130	11	But such an attempt is condemned to failure in advance. As well-known historians – like Eric Hobsbawm and Jean Bricmont – have emphasized, the irony is, of course, that no other nation in the world, except the Soviet Union, has been actively supporting the Third World’s liberation struggle against colonialism. And it was after World War II that the U.S. engaged irresistibly for the preservation of Western colonialism.
22130	13	So if we look at cases such as Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Palestine or Nicaragua to give just a few examples, it was the USSR that supported the national independence struggles of these countries, while the U.S. military defended the “Old Regimes”. The most remarkable case was, of course, South Africa and the South African front states, where the United States and Israel desperately tried to maintain the apartheid and the colonial rule of the settlers, while the Soviet Union and its allies fought against it – and even quite successfully – to defeat these rule.
22130	15	Moreover, it must be emphasized that it was more than any other nation the Soviet Union, which in the 1940s led the struggle against the attempt of Nazi Germany to colonize Europe – and ultimately the rest of the world. The USSR killed 27 million people.
22130	17	"Meanwhile, since World War II, the United States has created an empire of an unknown worldwide scale. It is estimated that the United States operates approximately 800 formal military bases in 80 countries, a number that could exceed 1,000 if you count the troops stationed in embassy, missions and so-called ""sleeping"" bases and which includes approximately 138,000 soldiers stationed abroad. No other nation in the world ever had or today has such a military scope. In fact, the relatively few other countries that have military bases abroad have not even collected a tenth of the number of U.S. bases."
22130	19	In fact, only eleven other nations operate bases abroad, which are about 70. Russia is estimated to have 26 to 40 bases in nine countries, mainly in former Soviet republics as well as in Syria and Vietnam. About Syria: While the speakers of the Helsinki Commission were trying to claim that Russia was involved in a kind of neocolonial attempt there, it is in fact the United States that appears as unbeatable – and therefore illegal – immigrant in Syria and occupies a third of the country against the will of the Syrian government and, in violation of the Geneva Conventions in this occupied country, regularly plunder Syrian oil for themselves.
22130	21	Meanwhile, Washington continues to retain its colonial influence on territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, Guantanamo Bay and Hawaii, not to mention the whole territory of today’s United States of America and Mexico represents a land stolen by indigenous peoples.
22130	23	In short, the U.S. government and its affiliated NGOs have no moral basis to “decolonize” anyone before they have de-colonized their own territories.
22130	25	Such an effort could begin with the removal of U.S. military bases around the world and the accompanying withdrawal of all foreign U.S. troops, with the return of all the stolen assets and resources to countries such as Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela and Russia, the return of Guantanamo Bay to Cuba, the hold of referendums in Puerto Rico and Hawaii on their independence and the payment of extensive repairs to the indigenous Americans and to the descendants of former slaves.
22130	27	A focus on the sins of its own country would not only be correct, but also be more promising, and also avoids the risks associated with the defence of the forced rejection of other nations such as the Russian Federation – as the Helsinki Commission calls on in its at least implicit call for a “descolonialization of Russia”.

22130	37	RT DE strives for a wide spectrum of opinions. Guest contributions and opinion articles do not need to reflect the view of the editor.
22137	1	Neither Russia nor the United States want a free Germany.
22137	3	Many Patriots in the BRD at least the majority who call themselves such believe that the Russians are the good. This is not about the Ukrainian conflict, but about the fact that the German people still think that the Russian army has been removed and had left the German soil. The propaganda for this, of course, has succeeded well since the name of Central Germany was changed to Eastern Germany, but the fact is the real East or Germany. Eastern Prussia is still occupied by the Russians.
22137	5	The difference between the American occupation is only one that the Germans were displaced and therefore it is not visible to anyone at least in everyday life. So if how many patriots think Russians are friends, why do they not give back the East Prussia? More than 20,000 Russian soldiers are stationed in Eastern Prussia. Neither Americans nor Russians want a free Germany, they always put their own interests in the first place, and these are not Germany back to strength. But to keep it on the ground for their interests, because a free Germany would mean a free Europe and this should not happen.
22138	1	SPD European Members Speak Against Prohibitions on Russian Media
22138	3	"SPD-European deputy Petra Kammerevert, in a guest contribution in the Frankfurt Rundschau, which has already appeared last week, has pledged against EU ban on Russian media and for the protection of opinion and media diversity. The EU will become unbelievable if it proceeds with autocratic methods "" against Putin""."
22138	5	The current reason is the EU’s new sanctions package against Russia, which, in addition to other measures, includes the ban on three Russian television stations, the state RTR Planeta and Rossija 24 and the Moscow regional broadcaster TV Center. These exclusively Russian-speaking broadcasters have so far been able to be received at least in Germany by cable, satellite and internet.
22138	7	Kamerevert already doubts the legal competence of the EU for the prohibition: the Commission supports its decision-making competence on the contractually standard competence to regulate economic relations, but arguments with the influence of the broadcasters on the social opinion formation. This is in itself contradictory and obvious that the true prohibition motives are not of economic nature.
22138	9	The Deputies, however, argue more fundamentally: “You can only win against Putin morally if you don’t sacrifice our freedoms for the purpose of supposedly protecting our society.” With the ban of Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, exactly that has already been done, writes Kammerevert. You can’t tell Putin for the prohibition of the German Wave and do the same with Russian broadcasters.
22138	11	Whether the ban actually works is doubtful. With VPNs, RT Live Stream is still accessible. Camerevert to:
22138	13	“The text dissemination of propaganda is still uninterrupted, because texts are not subject to any license.”
22138	15	Kamerevert appeals to give up the ban and to trust “our diverse and independent media”, “to disclose propaganda and disinformation.” Violations should be carried out by the media surveillance of the Member States. In question, she finds that “big platforms” are allowed to “definite fake news and disinformation with their business terms.” In addition to the individual case, the politician is concerned about legislative initiatives aimed at increasing restrictions on freedom of speech and media:
22138	17	Overall, the freedom of the media in Europe is significantly restricted, and the old phrase is “the opposite of good is good.” What we need instead of further restrictions is effective tools to defend media freedom and diversity.”
22138	19	Among the German Europeans, the MPs of the SPD were the only ones who voted in the European Parliament with a majority against the ban on RT and Sputnik. While the members of the CDU/CSU, the Alliance Green and the FDP voted for the ban, the Parliamentarians of the Left and the AfD participated in the vote in the European Parliament.
22138	21	"More on the topic - ""No fans of RT, but..."" - Dutch journalists want to appeal against RT prohibition in court"
22138	23	"By blocking RT, the EU aims to keep a critical, non-prowestern source of information silent. Not just about the Ukrainian war.

2214	1	Fear of civil war as a result of mass immigration.
2214	3	Former French intelligence chief Pierre Brochand warns that a civil war could break out if Europe and France do not radically change their policy on mass immigration: “All multicultural societies are dedicated to the destruction.”
2214	5	Brochand, who was director of the French DGSE from 2002 to 2008, said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro.
2214	7	“All ‘multicultural’ societies are condemned to more or less deep divisions,” Brochand warned, adding, “in such a situation it happens that minorities are violent winners and majorities peaceful losers.”
2214	9	The negative effects of mass immigration on France are no longer to be noticed, because it “will become more and more difficult to prevent the French from seeing what they see,” and also because “it has suddenly emerged a broken personality in the formal world of politics that has encouraged them to open their eyes,” Brochand said.
2214	11	If Emmanuel Macron wins the presidential election and does not massively change his attitude towards immigration, there could be a civil war.
2214	13	“This gradual turmoil of the French population is not the only challenge we are facing, but the only one that directly threatens civil peace on our territory,” Brochand said, warning that Muslim and non-European migrants have developed a “spirit of post-colonial revenge.”
2214	15	He also warned that the significantly higher birth rate of immigrants and the fact that the younger generations of immigrants “ are even less integrated into the French society than their parents” threaten the French society.
2214	17	The only solution, according to Brochand, is the “remigration” proposed by French presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, which is an incentive for millions of migrants to return to their homeland. the obligation to do so.
2214	19	Asked if it was too late, Brochand replied: “In any case, it’s too late. Let’s do nothing: we don’t have to do with dispersed individuals, that is, with many ‘special cases’ that are all looking for a better future, but with diasporas.”
2214	21	“A diaspora is a form consisting of immigrants and their descendants – including mostly the French – that gather together and reach a critical mass that is sufficient to promote the preservation of the beliefs and lifestyle of the countries of origin with whom the relationships continue to be tight,” says Brochand. “In this way, more or less closed foreign enclaves are formed spontaneously, which turn back to the reception country and its customs.”
2214	23	Brochand’s conclusion is annoying and dark.
2214	25	All my experience brings me forward a dark, very dark future for our children and grandchildren. In the best case they lead to an unprecedented collapse of their quality of life (an inflation), in the worst case we lead them to terrible confrontations (an explosion). Most likely there will be a combination of both in the middle of growing confusion.
2214	27	As RemixNews reports (link is external), Brochand expressed himself in the midst of another wave of migrants quiet visiting the French major cities.
2214	29	Since last week, the cities of Sevran and Aulnay-sous-Bois in the suburbs of Paris have been scenes of a real urban guerrilla war, and similar scenes have been in Villeurbanne and Vénissieux in the suburbs of Lyon. Every time there were interruptions between police officers trying to enforce the law, and violent, multiple-backed criminals, which formed the trigger of crawls, shootings and several fires, with the police units called for strengthening being trapped in background.
2214	31	A survey published last year by Harris found that the majority of the French are concerned that “European, white and Christian populations are threatened by extinction” as a result of “Muslim immigration”.
2214	33	However, Emmanuel Macron is expected to take a second term as president at the end of this month.
22142	1	U.S. makes Russia responsible for Sri Lanka crisis
22142	3	No petrol, no gas, electricity losses, horrendous prices: For months people in Sri Lanka have gone on the streets due to the severe economic crisis. The President and Prime Minister have announced their resignation. The U.S. Secretary of State, however, makes Russia responsible for the crisis.
22142	5	"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the ""Russian aggression"" in Ukraine is partially responsible for the disorders in Sri Lanka. The island state has been shocked by a protest wave for several months. Food and drug shortage, fuel and gas shortage, as well as rise in prices have driven people to the streets."
22142	7	The unrest escalated on Saturday when thousands of protesters stormed the president’s residence and forced him to flee. The private residence of the Prime Minister was also destroyed and eventually burned. Head of state Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced their resignation this weekend. The island state south of India, with its approximately 22 million inhabitants, is experiencing the worst economic crisis since the British independence in 1948. U.S. Secretary of State Blinken said to reporters in Bangkok: 
22142	9	“We see that the effects of Russian aggression can be felt everywhere. It could have contributed to the situation in Sri Lanka; we are worried about the impact around the world.”
22142	11	"He claimed that the ""growing food uncertainty"" in the world ""was significantly aggravated by the Russian aggression against Ukraine."" Blinken again urged Moscow to leave 20 million tons of grain from the Ukrainian ports, which he believes will be blocked by the Russian armed forces as part of their military offensive in the east-European country."
22142	13	"The U.S. Foreign Minister added that also in Thailand the prices of fertilizers due to the alleged blockade were ""shocked up""."
22142	15	Russia also denies all accusations of blocking food exports. From Moscow it is said to offer cargo ships safe passage, but Ukraine prevents civil ships from leaving ports, including Odessa. The ships deployed by Kiev are a threat to shipping in the area.
22142	17	Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lawrow said that some countries tried to exploit the food security issue “in the worst way” by accusing Moscow “of something it is not involved” and by “washing the Ukraine white.”
22142	19	In May, Sri Lanka for the first time in its history fell in retardation with its foreign debt. At the beginning of the month, fuel rationalizations were introduced, and armed police officers and soldiers were deployed to fuel stations. The crisis is backed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to the island’s significant income from tourism. A rise in government spending, tax cuts and a quantitative mildness in monetary policy push inflation to the height.
22142	21	Around 100,000 people are expected to have surrounded the Sri Lanka president’s residence in the capital Colombo on Saturday. The politician had been saved before.
22142	23	In the light of the crisis, the government had, among other things, asked for assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as several countries, such as India, China and Russia.
22143	1	NATO’s New Global Cold War is Official
22143	3	Finally, the U.S.-led NATO military alliance has revealed its ambitions for a global Cold War. Finally, the war rabbit organization has come out of its fraudulent hiding, in which it has been hiding for years. And therefore let them be condemned from now on by all the reasonable people in the world.
22143	5	At a summit in Madrid this week, the North Atlantic Pact Organization published a new strategic concept in which Russia is described as a “direct threat” and China as a “defiance” for “our values and interests”. What exactly are these values and interests? War and domination.
22143	7	The last time NATO published a strategic document was in 2010. At that time, Russia was called a “partner” and China was not even mentioned.
22143	9	Over the past ten years, the U.S. dominated military block has increasingly pursued an enemy policy against Russia and China. The search for a new Cold War was irresistible, irresistible and largely implicit. Now, however, the axis led by the United States explains its hostility.
22143	11	The 30 member NATO has officially invited two new European states, Finland and Sweden, to join their rows. The two Nordic countries thus end their decades of nominal neutrality, which can only be regarded as a calculated provocation to Russia’s national security. The new members will double NATO’s land border with Russia and strengthen the already growing presence of the nuclear-armed alliance in the Arctic. Moscow has warned of such NATO expansion as a deliberate destabilization of the strategic balance. The fact that the block advances the expansion testifies to a neglectless neglect of efforts for mutual security and the preservation of international peace.
22143	13	The NATO summit this week also made it clear that the U.S.-led military races are on the foot of war against China. Why else should an Atlantic organization first invite four Pacific states that have increasingly joined the American anti-China rhetoric? The leaders of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea were in Madrid to form the so-called Asia-Pacific Four (AP4). Like the U.S.-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and the AUKUS Pact, the Pacific will become a NATO battle zone against China, similar to the Atlantic being dominated by NATO’s enemy against Russia. Finally, the United States and its imperial interests are served and indicate the direction. That’s what we really mean with the vague and seemingly benevolent discouragement of “our values and interests”.
22143	15	This suspension in 2022 is in line with NATO’s historic role. It was founded in 1949 in Washington as an offensive instrument for the US aggression against the Soviet Union. The zero sum ideology of American imperialism is necessarily based on hegemony and domination. Other nations are either vasals or enemies. A multipolar world of mutual partnership is an anathema. In fact, the concept of the United Nations itself is a grace. The world must be divided into “allied and enemy” so that the militaristic US capitalism can survive.
22143	17	When the previous Cold War with the Soviet Union ended in 1991 by the political and economic collapse of the Soviet Union, the initial euphoria fled rapidly over the alleged American victory. The author and commentator John Rachel explores how the devastating speech of the end of militarism and the excessive military spending, as well as the expectation of a massive, transformative “Peace Division” was just too cruelty. And why? Because the U.S. powers and their NATO vassals realized that without militarism and war the game for their capitalist business massacre was over.
22143	19	Thus emerged the Wolfowitz doctrine and the “full spectrum dominance,” with which the United States and its European vasals literally declared war to the planet to drive the natural resources into the narrow and keep the alleged competitors under control. A reinforced Russia and an emerging China would not be tolerated as an obstacle to the U.S. hegemonial efforts.
22143	21	In the last 30 years since the end of the First Cold War, there has been nothing less than an orgie of the U.S. and NATO war strike, in which one weaker nation after another has been destroyed by militarism under U.S. leadership. International law and human rights have been exhausted and dispersed on the planet by a blitz war led by Washington.
22143	23	Principles-true people like Julian Assange who have discovered such crimes have been persecuted and tortured. Freedom of speech and genuine independent critical thinking were scandalized and murdered.
22143	25	With incredible hypocrisy, arrogance and blindness, U.S. President Joe Biden and other NATO complices glorify the principles of democracy, rule-based order and international law. In fact, the United States and its NATO Lakes are the enemies of world peace. Martin Luther King made a similar conclusion 60 years ago. He was killed by the U.S. National Security State. Washington and its Western or Pacific Complices are the greatest threat to everything they allegedly and cynically hold.
22143	27	The United States and its imperialist handlers in the NATO have sought a new Cold War in the last three decades. When the Russian Federation, under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, challenged the unilateralism of the shurk state of the United States and its satraps with its rough Munich speech in 2007, he was declared an enemy. Russia's military intervention in 2015 to support Syria, which was attacked by the US and NATO in a hidden war for a regime change, ended the orgia of the imperialist gangster under U.S. leadership. This game dealer made Russia an enemy that one had to deal with.
22143	29	The U.S. and NATO strike in Ukraine in 2014 was another striking event. It was a real expansion of NATO to the borders of Russia with a Nazi spire. Could it be more provocative? Moscow took the red line. Despite repeated calls for a diplomatic solution on the issue of Ukraine and NATO expansion, Russia was forced to take “technical military measures” and neutralize the threat from the Kiev regime.
22143	31	China has also demonstrated that it is not willing to subordinate its independence to the imperial rule of Washington. That’s why Washington has self-powered its half-century one-China policy, with the idea of turning Beijing. The provokation against Russia in the form of a NATO-equipped Ukraine is the same coin as the provokation against China with a US-equipped Taiwan and an increasing NATO inclusion in the Asia-Pacific area.
22143	33	Without exaggerating, it can be said that the NATO summit this week was the same as a war planning conference. The axis led by the United States has created a new global Cold War.
22143	35	This in itself is condemned. In a world stumbled by pandemies, diseases, environmental disruption, poverty, hunger and unemployment, the capitalist powers put billions in the war machinery and shed a confrontation fever based on fearfulness, phobia and demonization. His mentality is demonic. The imperialism led by the United States has caused much of the current crises in the world, including a new Cold War.
22143	37	Nevertheless, the world has changed dramatically since NATO was founded 73 years ago or even since the end of the last Cold War about three decades ago. There is actually the terrible danger of a catastrophic hot war. However, there is also the welcomed danger that NATO will swallow its own grave through its criminal activities and regrettable contradictions. If Russia and China remain stable, that could be enough to hit the U.S. axis into the grave it deserves.
22144	1	Stop the Masochism Exercises: Power Nordstream II!
22144	3	The violent infancial policy under the leadership of a small farmer and children’s books writer is faced with the oppression. She follows a fascist suspected government bar, brings “child minds to power”, but ruins ourselves instead of Mr. P. in Moscow. How naive can one be, as a politician, to want the Russian chess champion to have customized blocks around his ears, to leave exactly what we need and to block exactly what his country needs – and even to accept that one keeps the direction for a long time and parays the opposite side on the word?
22144	5	The policy wants to adjust the opponent according to the rules of art, to then properly purify a
22144	7	Such political alienations have not yet existed on state level in the author's history. In this regard, the word of the “time change” is the fact. Expectably, the U.S. affinity lighting policy fails already at the first half-capped gas turbine, which the Canadians do – please nice! Repaired should be issued so that they can be brought to Russia in the case of exception. Of course, the transportation is only unified for its own turbine, all other sanctioned transportation from and to Russia remained blocked. Welcome to Lithuania and the Russian Corridor to Königsberg!
22144	9	Is Oskar Lafontaine right with his statement: “Scholz is Putin’s and Bidens’ trottel?”
22144	11	The former SPD chairman and Federal Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine (here and here) could express what the majority in Germany thinks and, for example, hundreds of readers in the forum of a “world” article (here) almost unanimously confirm: This policy must go away. It has already scared and hurt us enough and leaves nothing good to hope for the future.
22144	13	Instead, all pressure toward a cessation of weapons and war in Ukraine must be exercised, and it must be seen that the deeply hostile peoples are hardly unable to unite peacefully in one state. Not when everything is broken up with more and more heavy weapons. At the same time, the energy supply from Russia, including Nordstream II, will be rebuilt – with the abolition of the anti-Russian blockades. The fatal speakers of “Never again energy from Russia” and “We’ll ruin Russia” should continue unhappily where they’ve already suited – as Mr. Blinken’s press speaker, who “will come from international law” and therefore has entrusted the right of the stronger.
22158	1	Federal pressure on Paxlovid could accelerate COVID mutations
22158	3	Bidens' FDA runs doctors to prescribe ineffective drugs
22158	5	The Pfizer drug that caused a recurrence of the symptoms when Dr. Anthony Fauci was vaccinated four times when he was infected with COVID-19 could, according to a Preprint study, help accelerate mutations in SARS-CoV-2 after the FDA extended the emergency approval.
22158	7	Virology researchers at the Medical University of Innsbruck found in an analysis of the Pfizer study hardly a difference in the number of hospitalizations or deaths between placebo and paxlovid recipients, as Just the News.
22158	9	Marty Makary, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said the study clearly shows that excessive use of Paxlovid in people with low risk can cause resistance and cause new viral mutations, and called this a “risk issue.”
22158	11	However, the FDA has authorized state-approved pharmacists to circumvent doctors by prescribing the drug directly.
22158	13	The cardiologist Dr. Anish Koka from Philadelphia wrote this week in his newsletter that seven months after the admission of the drug “apparently someone in the government has decided that not enough Paxlovid is prescribed.”
22158	15	The doctor said he had “in recent times to fight with a whole series of Paxlovid requests,” mostly from “young vaccinated patients.” The patients felt under pressure to take the treatment, and wanted “simply the confirmation by a specialist that it’s okay not to take a drug.”
22158	17	Koka said he received a “panic call” from an emergency call when an vaccinated and infected elderly patient developed paxlovid fever and swelling cold after a round he prescribed.
22158	19	The doctor now regrets that he has exposed his patient to “the side effects of a medication with little or no benefit” while “no” “in the vast majority of cases” seems to work better.
22158	21	Vice President Kamala Harris took the drug against her asymptomatic COVID infection this spring. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last month he experienced a decline in COVID symptoms after he was treated with the drug.
22158	23	In May, the Centers for Disease Control issued a formal warning that Paxlovid treatment could lead to a recurrence of COVID-19.
22158	25	Just the News asked the FDA how the expanded EUA could affect mutations, especially when the people who are most interested in taking the drug are already vaccinated and boosted.
22158	27	FDA spokesman, Chanapa Tantibanchachai, referred to a memo from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Review, in which it is argued that the expansion allows a “time treatment” for the patient in question as the drug is now “rightly” available.
22158	29	However, the study shows that the appearance of resistance was “unavoidable”, according to respiratory diseases specialist Peter Wark from the Australian University of Newcastle and the Hunter Medical Research Institute.
22158	31	Epidemiologist Vinay Prasad from the University of California in San Francisco tweeted that Pfizer “will earn more than $20 billion with this drug, and they have not yet submitted a positive randomized study on vaccinated people.”
22158	33	“Healthy 20-year-olds without complications and with three vaccines take this product,” he said.
22158	35	Prasad sees political movements behind the protest for Paxlovid.
22158	37	“The concern is of course that it should be seen as an offer for political reasons and not for medical reasons,” he wrote. “They have to limit the cases exactly at the time of the interim elections.
22158	39	“The other concern is that Pfizer obviously has an over-off of products, and this step will help them stop this offer. Do you only work in the best interests of Pizzer?”
22168	1	In Germany, everything breaks down, but the elites celebrate their feasts
22168	3	The elites make a party as if there was no tomorrow. The world’s most expensive and second-largest parliament approves its summer holidays and a eight-week session break, while in the country everything is gathered together. However, Germany’s Polit-Creme gave itself at Lindner’s decadent marriage to Sylt, where until recently thanks to the same politicians by 9-euro ticket mobile-made socials and punks were surrounded, the clinkes in the hand and then the champus side. Some even swim climate-appropriate by private jet.
22168	5	This all happens, while in the “Last Germany of all time” from long-visible cracks the first falls and dissolutions begin. There is a shortage of professionals in all fields and increasingly unqualified assistants – because those who could work don’t want more or make more money abroad, while Germany becomes the paradise of all those who don’t work. And with the constantly rising energy prices, which, unlike private households, are carried by the state for primary insurance recipients, the Hartz-IV status becomes more and more a secret tip and luxury; not only for the uninterrupted entrance of refugees from all over the world.
22168	7	There is a lack of package floor, switch officers, cassiers, airport carrier, security people. Only 100,000 truck drivers are needed. There is a shortage of teachers, police officers, and bookmakers – although the state creates 120,000 new plannings for full-service employees each year. Also to nurses, especially thanks to an abnormal institution-related vaccination obligation. The inflation goes through the unresistible and fire-threatening combination of the amount of money deposited on the one hand, and the commodity bonding on the other hand through the roof. Real is expected to reach 12-15 percent this winter, increasing trend. Today we are economically closer to Sri Lanka than to the former Federal Republic.
22168	9	But the elites and their voters do not understand it. They don’t hear the shoot, the shoot, the whole fire. The empty supermarket. Disrupted gas supplies, threatening blackouts. Prices that tend to rise again. supply chains and missing spare parts. Our streets are marble, almost all bridges need repair. The crafts breaks together. Public security eroded, swimming pools become terror camps. There is no reasonable education. The families break down, the clans triumph. And to all the migration, family retreat, “circulation” without control and without end.
22168	11	And they celebrate their summer feasts – before they then make our lives more difficult in the winter with new Corona shikans. It seems that everything is so desired. by DM)
2217	1	Friday for the Future: Save Palestine for the Climate! 
2217	3	The media’s image of “Fridays for Future” as a harmless Friday and School Sweater is not in line with the reality. Our ancestors have been able to do this for a long time, but now it is increasingly revealed.
2217	5	Hikes and school shots for the climate: The harmless children from the side – this is the media-based image of “Fridays for Future” (FFF). That this movement in reality may not be so harmless and could pursue an ideological agenda that goes far beyond “something with climate”, wise observers had already long guessed.
2217	7	Post-colonialism, “anti-rasism” and other disturbances – these parts of the FFF have become more and more obvious in the past years, lastly with the discussion of the racist content of filzlocks. Still, the repertoire of the Friday-Kids – at least their roof organization – also includes an intrigued Israeli enemy, as FFF has once again shown on its Twitter channel.
2217	9	“Climate justice means justice for Palestine, solidarity with Palestinian organizers in Germany and around the world,” he said. The background is the assembly ban issued by the Berlin Police for pro-Palestinian demonstrations on the weekend in the occasion of the so-called Nakba Day (the day of the Israeli state foundation, which the Palestinians perceive as a “catastrophe”).
2217	10	These prohibitions meant a “act of repression” by which “we” – that is, Fridays for Future – are “defined”. That the organization, of course, is not only about the protection of the freedom of assembly in Germany, but it itself is explicitly aimed at Israel, it made it clear in another contribution.
2217	12	The Israeli problem
2217	14	She spoke about the death of Palestinian journalist Shirin Abu-Akle on the edge of an Israeli anti-terrorist operation on Wednesday. The cause of the death – whether it were Palestinian guards or an Israeli crusader – is still the subject of investigations, which does not prevent the FFF from claiming that “Abu-Akle was murdered by the Israeli military (!) It’s been.
2217	16	A Israeli problem with the FFF has been revealed several times in the past. Thus, in 2021, the international roof organization had blamed against Israel’s “siddler-colonialism and imperialism” and spread Palestinian propaganda maps. The German publisher and Luisa Neubauer had then distanted and talked about “antisemitic content”.
2217	18	The label “Fridays for Future” of course did not want to give up. In addition, it remains questionable whether the FFF Germany has its own people in relation to its positioning towards Israel and anti-Semitism. On Sunday, Fridays for Future Mainz announced a call for a “Nakba Anniversary Demonstration”.
2217	20	Save Palestine for climate. The climate for Palestine? The “climate protection” has not been discussed for a long time. No sense and no sense anyway.
22172	1	and warning! Climate change is harmless. This man just remembered that it was hot in the summer even in his youth.
22172	3	Regensburg (dpo) - warning for the world climate! Thorsten Kohnmüller from Regensburg has just remembered that it was very hot in his youth during the summer, and thus impressively rejected the research of thousands of climate scientists around the world.
22172	5	“This whole hystery about global warming is absolutely ridiculous! When I was 13, it was 36 degrees in the summer,” Kohnmüller said on Wednesday, demonstrating the centrifugal thesis of global climate research that has been valid for decades. “The day all were free of heat and I was in the free bath until the evening. I know that quite precisely. “What does Greta Thunberg say?”
22172	7	"That the six hotest years since the beginning of the weather records in declining order were the years 2020, 2016, 2019, 2015, 2017 and 2018, he considers an invention. “No, I’m sure it must have been 1978. or in 1979. So I was really cool at that time."""
22172	9	In fact, it was even so hot at that time that he once burned himself on the parking lot in front of the Baggersee almost the foot soils on the asphalt, Kohnmüller said. “That’s what the fine ladies and gentlemen climate scientists should explain to me how this could be. The climate change? Because of it! Chess and Matt.
22172	11	For politics and economics, Kohnmüller’s brilliant knowledge is a blessing: expensive environmental protection measures can be stopped worldwide, climate conferences no longer need to be held, gasoline is expected to cost only 50 cents per liter soon.
22172	13	The discovery of the climate lies is not the first genius of the Rainbow. Only yesterday he was able to reject the alleged danger of smoking once and for all because he knew someone who was a smoker and yet became relatively old.
2218	1	Ukraine by theft of Russian assets “heads out of ash” – from the Leyen in Davos 
2218	3	EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was pathetic at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “We are mobilizing our entire economic power,” she said, “Ukraine must win this war.”
2218	5	"Another ten billion euros of financial aid will go to the country to which Leyen wants to ""help hand in hand"" to ""heal himself out of the ash."" She also called for the theft of Russian assets: ""We should turn every stone - if possible, the Russian assets we have frozen."""
2218	7	Russia uses grain and energy as weapons, according to its accusation; as an example for countries to suffer from it, it called (link is external) exactly the Lebanon, where the price of bread has risen by 70 percent. That Lebanon is also the target of Western sanctions, she did not mention in this context.
2218	9	The EU Commission President also sees no contradiction with the plans to increase the share of “green” energy sources to 45 percent by 2030 and thus further reduce the need for Russian fossil fuels. The war in Ukraine forced the EU to accelerate the transformation of the European economy.
2218	11	Since both the chemical and automotive industries have already declared that under the conditions created by the sanctions they could not produce, the announced plans of the Commission, according to the trade sheet (link is external), have also met little interest in the small sector. Their associations addressed in a letter from Leyen and demanded the end of the more burden and more time for the necessary adjustments. The supply chain law, as well as the introduction of a CO2 balance mechanism and various requirements for stricter evidence obligations should be postponed.
2218	13	"The chairman of the Union of European Chamber of Industry and Commerce (Eurochambres), Luc Frieden, also said that Leyen must ""resolve with the economy."""
22183	1	Lithuanian failure to block Kaliningrad is a defeat for the United States
22183	3	Nevertheless, no one should hold the wrong assumption that this development implies a transatlantic breakdown between the EU and the United States, because nothing like that is ongoing. Instead, the EU has unexpectedly defended itself against the United States after it has provoked a serious crisis between Russia and the block through its instrumentalization of Lithuania for this purpose.
22183	5	The clarification by the European Commission that its anti-Russian sanctions by Lithuania should not be interpreted as a green light for a blockade of the Kaliningrad area strongly indicates that the block is uncomfortable with the destabilizing influence that the U.S. is intended to exercise on the Baltic country. The unilateral interpretation of these previous restrictions by Vilnius as a prejudice to the interruption of the road and rail connections with this Russian exlave was rather a political provocation set by Washington aimed at manipulating the attitudes of the Western population, rather than an attempt to deteriorate the living standard of the people in this region, as the author of his time explained here. The decision to join Brussels in this regard is therefore an unexpected defeat for this falling unipolar Hegemon.
22183	7	The U.S. has successfully restored its hegemony over the EU under an anti-Russian prejudice at the beginning of the ongoing Moscow military special operation in Ukraine and has even led to its European vasals to counterproductively sanction its main suppliers of raw materials and thus trigger an absolute avoidable economic crisis that has brought the euro to parity to the dollar for the first time in two decades. If some European companies would fall into bankruptcy soon, their U.S. and UK competitors would benefit from it. Overall, the U.S. is currently almost fully under control of the EU, but they have finally gone too far when they forced Lithuania to block Kaliningrad and thus provoke a serious crisis between Russia and the block.
22183	9	This was too much for the “Great Three” (France, Germany and Italy), who quickly intervened through the European institutions to reaffirm their own much more direct hegemony over the Baltic country by clarify that their sanctions cannot be exploited to stop the transit of civil products to the Russian exlave by rail. Even though Lithuania is an American Vasal state, it is rather a European state when it comes to hard, as it was recently. Vilnius could not oppose the European Commission, so it held on its political clarification and thus acted against the will of Washington. This happened only because the “Great Three” thought it was unacceptable to provoke Russia in such a dreadful way, which in turn spoke for their comparatively more pragmatic attitude towards the Ukrainian conflict.
22183	11	Nevertheless, no one should hold the wrong assumption that this development implies a transatlantic break between the EU and the United States, because nothing of this is to be observed. Instead, the EU has unexpectedly defended itself against the United States after it has provoked a serious crisis between Russia and the block through its instrumentalization of Lithuania for this purpose. This shows that America’s biggest European vasals accept so much what their master demands from them unless there is the risk that this in the worst case will trigger a direct conflict with Russia, as some feared that the U.S. orchestrated blockade of Lithuania against Kaliningrad threatened to do so. In such cases, the “Great Three” have demonstrated that they have the political will to act decisively against Washington’s wishes.
22183	13	Five conclusions can be drawn from this incident. First, the U.S. will use its smallest and Russian-fobic EU vassals to provoke a crisis between Russia and the block. Second, if the “Great Three” policy makers believe that the crisis in the worst case could lead to a direct conflict with Russia, they will resolutely intervene to prevent it. Thirdly, this intervention takes place in the form of the restoration of its own hegemony over the US valleys that were instrumentalized to resolve the crisis. Fourth, the United States is not expected to enter into an agreement with the EU in such cases, as this poses the danger of dividing the unit of the block and thus weakening the larger platform they have used to “depress” Russia. And finally, these unexpected differences between the EU and the United States should not be interpreted in such a way that they lead to a break between them.
22192	1	Putin's work and Kyrill's contribution
22192	3	"The Zauselbart tracker, often referred to as the hatred preacher and the ""Kalaschnikov of God"", is the spiritual Eminence of the Russian war propaganda.    "
22192	5	"If Viktor Orbán had not recently prevented the Supreme Mufti of the Russian Orthodox Church from entering the EU sanctions list, stronger measures against Moscow would probably fail in a Hungarian veto. Who is the man who, from his proximity to the Russian president and his war, does not make a heal and praises the cast of strike bombs even as a living Christian neighborhood? In the TITANIC interview, Patriarch Kyrill, who actually calls ""Wladimir Heinz-Peter Gundjaev"", speaks about his preference for Swiss luxury clocks, the effects of a possible judgment against Putin and tells us what brilliant and difficult to discover detail distinguishes him from historical spiners like Ivan to the terrible.  "
22192	7	TITANIC: Your spirituality, before your priesthood, you were a long active agent of the KGB. In the 1990s, you were then “Tabak-Metropolitan” for sights, when the Orthodox Church massively imported cigarettes to Russia and you broke billions with the sale of chips. Do you not disqualify such a prehistory for such an important and decent office?  
22192	9	KYRILL: I have to ask very much! At the KGB, I learned everything I needed to weaken the testimony of interrogation and torture techniques from Pike to Pike. And as for the flops: to help the Russians not ruin the liver and instead smoke a chain when they drink water, I still consider, even after a few years of distance, as a service to man. That the unacceptable pack just did both, I couldn’t know at that time.  
22192	11	TITANIC: Already at the beginning of your career, as an external representative of the Russian Church, you have attacked the ‘post-modern popularity’ of the western world, offering you ‘deadful death aid and abortions’. What exactly misses you in that?  
22192	13	KYRILL: You know, from my past at the foreign intelligence service, active death aid is not strange to me at all. For people who suddenly no longer see any meaning in their lives because of their continued occupation with freedom of speech and democratic fundamental rights, a sprinkl Nowitschok can actually seem very liberating. And as you are just talking about pregnancy abortions, I ask you, in what Russia would we live today if our mothers had dismissed Putin, Lawrow and me, instead of making us heart-like people?    
22192	15	TITANIC: We prefer not to answer it for health reasons. Theme change: Just one percent of the Russian population considers you a morally relevant instance, according to recent surveys. Thus, you are still behind oil magnets, nightclub owners and mafia paths. Probably even Ivan the Horrible would have better values today than you. Is this not destructive for a church head?  
22192	17	KYRILL: Of course, as you say, it sounds stupid. It can also be expressed differently. Nine-nine percent of the Russians find that I am an absolute coryphy in matters of immorality. I have to make one of them first.  
22192	19	TITANIC: On an official photo you once left your $100,000 expensive Swiss luxury clock off. But the graphics had forgotten to remove the mirror image of the time meter on the smooth board, so your weakness was known for scratched mammons everywhere. That must have been quite shameful for you...  
22192	21	KYRILL: It is sad? I took over the 'Audemars piquet of 18 carate roségold house and platinum chips' then by a man who could no longer bear the burden of wealth on his arm, and for the same reasons, for me, for the same reason, he also broke up his yacht, his Moscow Penthouse apartment, and the Ferrari car park, before he admitted himself permanently to a Siberian Gulag. For me, this disgusting wealth is a little like I would carry the cross of Jesus 24/7 to Golgotha. Boah is hard. ( to be supported )    
22192	23	TITANIC: On the occasion of the Annunciation of Mary on March 25th, you will always personally release a few peace tubes in the Moscow Dune Sky before your office church. This year, for the first time, they didn’t get back in the shock. What has become of the birds?  
22192	25	KYRILL: They have passed the Kremlin, where just a small military parade was held. Companion Putin was simply not able to resist that, the old Schlawiner. But there shouldn’t be the same ground-air missiles.  
22192	27	TITANIC: In an interview you have claimed that an invasion of Ukraine is already necessary so that there cannot be held gay parades. Except that we can’t understand what disturbs you. Is that not exaggerated as a war?  
22192	29	KYRILL: The problem is that such things continue to spread into wave movements. Everything begins with a quiet move through the center of Kiev and before you move, the Russian President looks at 'Brokeback Mountain' on DVD every night, our Foreign Minister receives Elton John and the Don Kosaken-Chor dances on the Red Square to YMCA.  
22192	31	TITANIC: The Danube Weather! They know themselves suspiciously well.  
22192	33	KYRILL: (dirty and nervously rushing around the chair): The next question, please.  
22192	35	"Titanium is OK. In a letter they wish Vladimir Putin ""a strong health, soul peace and rich help of the Lord in his high and responsible service to the Russian people."" And if your allegedly blurred president still “take the light in the shade” – would you recognize it as a divine judgment against a dictator and warrior?    "
22192	37	KYRILL: As far as I know, the president, from fear of God’s judgment, only cracks at home in a brilliant “faradays’s cage.” That’s why he’s always looking so disgusting when he’s out of the Kremlin. But if the Creator’s anger had brought him up with high-gone pants, I would actually describe it as a heavenly sign.  
22192	39	The Titanic: Aha. For what?  
22192	41	KYRILL: That I should also break the political power on me and become ayatollah of Moscow.  
22192	43	TITANIC: You are spinning. Well then, thank you for the conversation.  
22192	45	KYRILL: I am pleased. Stange Marlboro, my son?           
22193	1	G20 summit: Lawrow calls on the West to pull Russian supermagnet tanks to Ukraine
22193	3	Nusa Dua (dpo) - At the G20 meeting in Bali, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lawrow raised serious accusations against the West. While Russia itself did not have any intentions of invasion against Ukraine, it was the NATO that pulled Russian tanks and soldiers on Ukrainian territory in February with a powerful supermagnet.
22193	5	"""There's no other explanation,"" Lawrow said, as he kept a graphic with a large hole-shaped magnet in height. Why should a peaceful country like Russia invade Ukraine throughout the world? It was the fierce NATO supermagnet that moved our military against its will over the border. The West is guilty.”"
22193	7	Since then, Russia has tried everything in its power to leave Ukraine again. “But the magnet is simply too powerful,” Lawrow explained. “Our tanks and rocket shooters are only constantly shooting to throw down ballast.”
22193	9	The exact location of the supermagnet is currently unknown. “We suspect he is in Kiev. This is seen in our previous military movements. I urge NATO to immediately turn off this supermagnet! This behavior is a threat to world peace.”
22193	11	Lawrow then ignored all the word messages and left the G20 meeting even before the German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's speech - allegedly because another supermagnet suddenly pulled to his government machine.
22196	1	“We hardly find people” – MiesBezahlteDrecksjobs GmbH’s chief complained of staff shortage
22196	3	Berlin (dpo) - What's just going on with the labour market? Arnold Menschenschinder complains that his company, MiesBezahlteDrecksjobs GmbH, has the greatest effort to find skilled employees in almost all locations in Germany.
22196	5	“Uncomprehensible, why do we just find no one?“The entrepreneur complains. “There we pay precisely at the minimum wage level, offer unflexible working hours, unpaid overhours and lack of rising opportunities, and yet hardly one wants to start with us. I’m facing a mystery.”
22196	7	Similarly, there are friends of entrepreneurs such as the head of who-one-operative council-founded-wird-rausgemovt OHG, the BoniNurAnVorstände AG and the company We-imagine-no one-of-and-wonder-we-then-over-disappearing-fathers & sons. “They don’t find anyone either. It’s really like a slurry!”
22196	9	The 64-year-old asks for quick action. “Whether we now get cheap foreigners or whether the policy sends me unemployed or even takes part of the pay costs: something has to happen urgently. Otherwise we will miss profits and that will hurt the end of the German economy.”
22198	1	Chaos at airports becomes worse: pilot imprisoned in the cargo room while roll-bag machine controlled to Mallorca
22198	3	Hamburg, Palma (dpo) - It was just a matter of time until staff need and overload at German airports would lead to dangerous errors. On Thursday, at the Hamburg Airport, a pilot was accidentally loaded with his luggage into a Boeing’s cargo room and had to spend the entire flight there, while a roll bag led the machine to Mallorca.
22198	5	“Yes, so... there’s something completely disappointed,” an airport official says. “We can be really happy that it all went out spectacularly.”
22198	7	Those who are accurate are currently being investigated. It is clear only that the pilot actually intended for the flight was not as usual passed by the safety slope to his machine, but was picked up and charged as a baggage.
22198	9	When the Boeing 737 was finally ready to start with a 40-minute delay, it appeared a roll bag that was actually intended for the loading room was on the pilot seat.
22198	11	“I also felt funny,” co-pilot Peter Kahle explains. “But I thought the airlines will already know what they’re doing and who they’re sharing. I just made the roulette bag. Most of this is done by the autopilot. If necessary, I would have intervened.”
22198	13	"In fact, the flight to Palma de Mallorca went largely disturbing. Only the otherwise usual passages (""If you now look to the left from the window, you would see the Montblanc if it wasn't so cloudy."") Some of the passengers were missing."
22198	15	"Also the landing was described by some holiday travellers as ""somewhat rough""."
22198	17	A family also complained that a 40-year-old man in pilot clothes had been received in place of their roll bag at the packaging exhibition on Palma.
2224	1	What Europeans Really Think About Migration and Immigration
2224	3	Last December 1,000 people in Austria, Flanders, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Hungary were questioned for asylum and immigration on behalf of the EU group “Identity & Democracy”.
2224	5	Europeans are quite the same
2224	7	Although the Greek question of whether or not Europeans fundamentally wish or refuse immigration from other continents has not been raised, all other answers show that the EU and the majority of the Member States are not in accordance with the citizens' will. For this is clear: the majority has enough of immigration.
2224	9	Only the respondents from the Netherlands have the feeling that their opinion on the immigration issue is taken into account. Not all other respondents see this, so know about the circumstances that the government acts against the will of the citizens.
2224	11	Hungarians and Austrians are critical.
2224	13	The EU plans, without the citizens ever asking for their consent, at least in the coming years (!) 70 million immigrants arrived in Europe. Of course, because the concerned refuse it, as the survey shows.
2224	15	On the question of whether “Europe can jointly accept the expected minimum of 70 million migrants over the coming years,” the majority answered clearly: “No.” The Austrians, after Hungary, the second least believe that Europe can “do it” (two-thirds of the respondents).
2224	17	Request for cost-benefit account
2224	19	The answer to the suggestive question whether to support the “re-distribution of migrants from other EU Member States into their own country” is also clearly answered by the concerned: Only Spain and Italy, which have so far very successfully transferred their illegal immigrants to the north, can imagine that. Not all others.
2224	21	All respondents speak for a better border protection, and everyone would like to know what “public costs and/or economic profits through migration” their country has to show. An absolute majority of respondents from all countries believe that their government should limit the immigration of people without professional qualifications.
2224	23	In a press conference, the FPÖ EU Member Roman Haider and the FPÖ Security spokesman Hannes Amesbauer put on the table today, Wednesday, the necessary action tasks from this questionnaire, especially the very critical answers from Austria.
2230	1	The Great Wurf
2230	3	Presidential reform tax, debt, global sovereignty. Emmanuel Macron has many plans for the EU – but will he be able to implement them? 
2230	5	The desire to risk cannot be contested by Emmanuel Macron. He suggests he wants to struggle with Europe and as a European for the next presidency. And that's the EU nihilism of nationalist, ultra-right counter-candidates such as Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. More and more, Élysée sees the newly begun presidency as an incentive to rescue the united Europe from its reform tail and, if necessary, to burst against the tail. Macron wants to win the heads of the other 26 member states to give the EU more global sovereignty. It should be concerned that these states unions do not fall from the ranking alongside the US, China and Russia. “We must come to an Europe that is strong in the world, free in its choice and master of its own fate,” he said. From his point of view, strategic self-balance is essential for the EU to emancipate itself from the United States and NATO because it benefits its internal constitution.
2230	7	Macron is not sure that his country will lead the European Council, not the EU as a whole. Unfortunately, he will encounter an agenda of self-powering to counterfeit with unreliable Atlanticers in Germany and unreliable American friends in Eastern Europe. Since the Scholz government has given itself less of the imperial aura than the internal metamorphosis of the EU, conflicts with Paris are predictable. The coalition treaty promises a constitutional convention dedicated to “the further development of the European Union as a federal European state.” This sounds suspicious after that “finalization” of integration, as the Green Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in his speech at the Berliner Humboldt-Universität on 12. May 2000 is targeted. At that time, the alternative – the federal state or the state union – was in the air. What had succeeded when in 2005 the constitutional agreement, which was the way for final integration, failed at the referendum in France and the Netherlands. Will Germany seriously reanimate what it was, the electoral fighter Macron will have nothing but to mutate from the European to the French and warn of Irrwegen.
2230	9	France, the perfect lobbyist
2230	11	It is also applied to the European Financial Regulation. France has long been suspected of the severe Maastricht criteria for the debt recovery of the Eurostates. Meanwhile, it is argued that the necessary state investments for a more climate-friendly economy will only exist if you adjust budget and finance. It is ridiculous to adhere to budget rules when the final climate collapse is threatened.
2230	13	As the EU’s Corona Fund’s €750 billion will be invested mostly in the financial markets in 2020, this is an unimaginable process to date. In the emergency, the ban on debt for the EU has been extinguished. Member States (from 2028) are required to compensate for the loans, but at the same time the EU needs new sources of income. The Brussels Commission supports, among other things, a carbon dioxide tax on imports from non-EU companies that are subject to lower climate protection standards than usual in Europe. Emmanuel Macron has already announced that he will present the necessary draft decision, which can be adopted at the next EU summit. It remains open to the extent to which there will also be arrangements for a re-collective debt collection. First of all, however, it is likely to be welcomed by the EU Commission’s legislative act on the so-called taxonomy, proposed on behalf of the European Green Deal. France was the perfect lobbyist as the spokesman of the twelve EU countries that see a climate-friendly and promising transitional technology in nuclear energy.
2232	1	Ambassador to Politics 
2232	3	"Ukrainian Ambassador Melnyk called Chancellor Scholz an offended liver root. The reason for the verbal attack was that Scholz himself did not want to visit Ukraine due to a confrontation with Federal President Steinmeier. Other German politicians also wrecked the saloppe ambassador Salt in the wounds: for example, he welcomes that Prime Minister Bouffier did not rejoice, ""the eye ultimately governs with."" The FDP’s willingness to deliver weapons, however, is not a miracle; in the end, they have always lived like the “made in the speck” of the arms lobby. Even before the dead Melnyk is not afraid of his failures. The demand for a few heavy weapons has already brought today’s politicians to cook, but they’ve never made the straw or the coal fat. “They were both,” said Melnyk. Only the ruling mayor of Berlin did not look negatively. “They have eggs, but unfortunately only in the face.” "
2233	1	Now also confirms Pfizer chief: vaccines against Corona infections are practically ineffective
2233	3	Again, it is not only confirmed by “disconfusion theorists” and serious scientists who in countless studies confirm the extensive inefficiency of Corona vaccines against viral transmission. Even independent media, such as OUR MIDDLE EUROPE, should retain the right, unlike the smell spots in the main media.
2233	4	It is clear that the rulers are aware of this, because otherwise people would not be ordered to wear masks despite vaccinations and tests. About the other reasons why we are forced to be masked, we don’t want to go into this article, and also not to see if masking is meaningful at all, if not even harmful under certain circumstances.
2233	6	Total failure of vaccine campaigns no longer to deny
2233	8	Let’s turn to the statements of the Chef of Pfizer. In a video, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tells out what is no longer to hide: the obvious total failure of previous vaccination campaigns.
2233	10	At the same time, the development of a new vaccine is announced, which is intended to provide all the only imaginable safeguards: immunity in simultaneous action against new variants and for calming a maximum protection against any accidental diseases. This ovarian wol milk sauce under the vaccines is then intended to replace the traditional vaccines from April. Whether this will work this time, or another flop will just wipe billions into the Pharmalobby’s treasures, now no one can say – not even the Pfizer boss. We’re typing no, because the disciplination terror is to continue and the Pharmalobby will not stop the permanent re-vaccination.
2233	12	Until then, this officially ineffective item, which was purchased for billions and is no longer to get rid of, will not be “vaccinated” quickly. Otherwise, the billions of fraud threatens to end even faster.
2237	1	The war did not fall from heaven. “By the grace of God America won the Cold War.”
2237	3	The people in Russia may be for or against Putin or the current war against Ukraine. They may be old communists or new realms, Soviet algics, ‘Westler’ or Panslawists. Professional workers, professors, sellers, unemployed or retirees. They may live in the Black Deregion, in the Wolgadelta, Transbaikal, Udmurt, Yakutia, or in the Republic of Komi. With one sentence you bring them all to the palm:
2237	5	    The Soviet Union has lost the Cold War. 
2237	7	In fact, the Hurra triumphalism of certain western circles has contributed significantly to the fact that Russia and the West, long before Russia’s attack war on Ukraine, were in a second Cold War, along with extremely dangerous new winds. And it is notable for the mental and moral level of the people whom this sentence goes so smoothly over the lips that they obviously can think only in the categories of victory and defeat! But the sequence.
2237	9	preliminary retention
2237	11	When the wall fell in the autumn of 1989 and the peaceful revolutions in Eastern Europe defeated the communist dictatorships, the U.S. administration remained under George H.W. Bush is diplomatically back. In Washington, one was aware that any lauthal western hurricane would only hurt the further course of the events. Finally, already disturbing events were recorded as a possible reunification of Germany, which should not be threatened. This was the first of all the demonstrative gestures that could have been humiliating to the people of the Soviet Union – while the “Russian separatists” and the subsequent murderer of the country, Boris Jelzin, were already promoted clandestin! on 21. In November 1990, George Bush senior, together with 31 other state and government leaders, signed the “Charta of Paris”, which in its central and epochal sentence: “Security is inseparable, and the security of each participating state is inseparably connected with all the others” with the rival thinking and action, with the potentially world-destruction policy of the zero-sum game of the superpowers broke. This ended the Cold War.
2237	13	At least the world thought.
2237	15	The Coming Out
2237	17	But a month after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Bush was unable – accidentally during the election campaign – to keep on and on the 28th. In January 1992, at the beginning of his annual ‘State of the Union Address’[2] before Congress, it formally broke out of it: the world has experienced changes of truly biblical scale in the last twelve months. This year, nothing less than communism itself died. And for a long time he, the president, had not had the opportunity to “to show the joy that was what in my heart.” “The biggest thing that has ever happened in his and in the lives of others is this: “By the grace of God America won the Cold War!”
2237	19	No sentence has proved to the Western-Russian relationship as fatal as this! This sentence already contains the following American policy of unilateralism, the “one-world power”, the NATO Eastern extensions, the policy of regime change, the international law-free attacks, the annulment of almost all arms and control treaties. And he proves that the man who spoke him, and all those who subsequently, with his proud breasts, repelled him thoughtlessly and acted according to his logic, were apparently mentally too limited and morally too irresponsible to capture the decisive at all.
2237	21	Gambling confidence
2237	23	Without the revolutionary policy of the Soviet administration at the time, say: Without the policy of the New Thought – at that time as today, decades ahead, because it sets the interests of the whole humanity over the fatal rivalry of the superpowers – the Cold War would never have ended peacefully! Mikhail Gorbachev, the architect of this revolutionary turn in foreign and arms policy thinking and action, formulates it as follows:
2237	25	"    “The end of the Cold War was our joint victory. It came through dialogue and negotiations on the most complicated issues of security and disarmament and by establishing bilateral relations. Without all of this, the Cold War and the weather could have lasted for a few decades. And who knows what this could have led to."" "
2237	27	Unfortunately, it did not remain.
2237	29	    “Instead of acknowledging all this, the West declared himself the winner. The end of the Cold War – that was for him only accomplished with the end of the Soviet Union. American statesmen called this a policy from the position of the force. And concluding, it is now necessary to further develop our own military power, to maintain our own will, to create a unipolar world, an American empire. Now the world had to see how the trust capital collected in the 1980s was spilled, how instead of a new, secure world order the ghost of a new chaos emerged, in which the law of the stronger ruled. The Charter of Paris, the ideas of collective security, the creation of a Security Council for Europe, which were seriously discussed in 1991, were, on the contrary, forgotten.”
2237	31	We are now facing the thresholds of this development.
2237	33	The Cold Wars lost the Cold Wars.
2237	35	Let’s put things right for all times. The First Cold War could be ended because the Soviet administration around Mikhail Gorbachev had previously defeated in thought and action nothing less than the logic of the arms itself! And it was precisely this that the first opposing West was able to force the remaining disruption of the most dangerous weapons in the short and medium range and a worldwide nuclear disarmament by 80 percent.
2237	37	This is still very present to the Russians. A little tip: just go – yes, it’s possible now! – go to Russia and ask the first best Russians who runs you over the way. He will tell you, “We have ended the Cold War.”
2237	39	In one word, the Cold War was lost by the Cold Warriors. And the rest of mankind won him.
2237	41	I had!
2250	1	To “vaccinate” against the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) stops the spread, right? false is. The latest data shows that the more vaccinated a condition is vaccinated, the higher the rate of omicron (mental) and other “variants” is.
2250	3	Data scientist and PhD Emily Burns gathered a series of evidence she posted on Twitter showing that the ten most vaccinated states now have about 400 percent more cases compared to the previous year.
2250	5	While the fall rates last year were approximately the same between vaccinated and non-vaccinated states at the time when the shooters were first introduced under Warp Speed operation, things have changed since then.
2250	7	Now that all of the Fauci flu juice had the chance to fix its damage in the bodies of “fullly vaccinated” people, the negative effects of vaccines were never clearer.
2250	9	“When we look at 10 MOST-VAXED conditions and 10 LEAST-VAXED conditions, we see that there is practically Nothing underlying when comparing the change of the year...”, Burns tweeted.
2250	11	“In addition, that the 10 most damped now have almost 400% higher cases than the previous year, where the 10 most frequented, “only” have increased by 112%.
2250	13	In other words, the cases of Fauci flu have increased dramatically since Donald’s “father of the vaccine” Trump’s injections have reached the arms of hundreds of millions of Americans.
2250	15	“The big difference ( 4x) b/n % increase in YoY cases b/n 10 most frequently and 10 least frequently can be explained by vax negative effectiveness (a higher likelihood of infection) for Omikron,” Burns added.
2250	21	“Neg-efficiency means more Vax = more cases – what we see.”
2250	22	The majority of vaccinated states also report a different increase in deaths, while the deaths in the least vaccinated states decrease.
2250	24	in Ontario, Can. For example, now, after the first two doses, a negative effectiveness of the vaccine is. This means that people lose immunity after taking.
2250	25	Countries with the highest Covid vaccines also record the highest increase in Omikron cases!
2250	27	“Receiving 2 doses of COVID-19 vax does not protect against an omicron infection at any time,” a study continued.
2250	29	Another serious concern is the recent difference in mortality rates between vaccinated and non-vaccinated states. It turns out that the most vaccinated countries have a sudden increase in deaths, while the deaths in the least vaccinated countries are now decreasing.
2250	31	Burns further explains that the vaccine rates in most countries in the age group are above 65 percent or higher. On average, 95-99 percent of this age group received at least one dose.
2250	33	“The Diff between Single Vax and Double Vax in 65+ is probably not due to a type of late-up anti-vax mood,” Burns says. “It is probably due to bad rxns. [High] spread means [high] risks for these fragile people.”
2250	35	“Given repeated studies that show a negative vax-effect – immediately in the case of Omicron, the current occurrence can confuse anyone, including children who are not in danger and previously infected, older people who are two [sic] fragile, quite cause two doses to be in danger.”
2250	37	The situation is mildly said a chaos – especially with Jab mandates that strike on every side. It is unquestionably clear that injections decrease health and increase disease and death. The question is: Will the masses ever finally raise objections against this mass genocide?
2250	39	“Omicron is a excuse to hide vaccine damage,” a commentator wrote about the situation.
2250	41	“The Fraudci report breaks great,” another wrote.
2250	43	“We’re talking about a cold,” said someone else, probably about Omicron. “This is mad!”
2250	45	“The only thing the Jab does is so to give you side effects for the rest of your life... Snake oil!” wrote another. “Therefore, Pfizer and Modern have abolished the control groups.”
2250	47	“What can you expect if the immune system is damaged?” asked another and referred to the fully vaccinated. “But colds will get you!”
2252	1	Developing countries instead of world power: U.S. government calls for energy resistance
2252	3	of Washington. It is an unprecedented bankruptcy declaration of the alleged “one-world power”: the White House was now forced to call for the U.S. energy resistance. In a press release on Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the power supply in the U.S. can no longer be fully guaranteed. The fault is the war in Ukraine and the climate change, the president suggests.
2252	5	According to Bloomberg, the risk of blackout in Europe, parts of Asia and the United States has increased significantly since mid-June. The White House press release said: “More factors threaten the ability of the United States to provide enough electricity to meet the expected customer demand. These factors include disturbances in the energy markets caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and extreme weather events that are aggravated by climate change.”
2252	7	The solution is now intended to create an increased import of solar cells from Southeast Asia. The White House expects, according to a press release, “that the supply of solar capacity and batteries in the years 2022 and 2023 will account for more than half of the new capacity of the electricity sector.”
2252	9	The Biden administration goes even to the extent to view the predictable electricity deficits as a threat to national security. In this context, observers, however, think it is illusory that the U.S. intends to start exporting LNG gas for the energy supply of Europeans at the latest from 2023. The “one-world power” (Z. Brzezinski) will probably need the gas itself to prevent electricity losses. 
2257	1	Mask or not? Be like Cem, Justin, Markus and Co! 
2257	3	Our politicians obviously have long known what to say about the “measures”. While travellers in the train have to count on references when they refuse the mask, politicians are apparently immune to any virus – and show themselves maskless in the train.
2257	5	You don’t have to go to Sweden. It is enough a trip to the Netherlands to find them back, that relaxed normality in which we also this country, before there was that crisis that made use, especially, of German politicians. Among the Dutch neighbors, the only one who can filter the fresh sea air of mostly unhygienic masks before mouth and nose may be German tourists. And while you go to this country with a distant look, when an uncovered one approaches, you are friendly and relaxed in the neighboring countries. There is no trace of that panic pandemic that keeps the public life still under control in Germany, not only in medical practitioners or buses and trains.
2257	7	The German subjects seemed to be accustomed to the piece of material in front of the face. Finally, the spring follows not only the summer, but also the autumn, in which we get a new, still a lot! A lot! More dangerous viruses are at risk. In any case, a health minister has told the citizens that he has been looking forward to accelerating the conditions that threaten to overthrow the health system in any influenza wave: closing hospitals, laying down beds, scratching nurses. The reduced crisis is made at home, so it is better to push it on a virus.
2257	9	The pressure must beined. Otherwise, you must admit that you’ve made a mistake. Neither the virus was fatal nor the vaccines kept what they promised. rather the opposite. The alleged life-saving “measures” often prove to be more harmful than what they should prevent. That’s even now – amazing! Until the other time, the government’s “spiegel” went through. Yes, in fact: not only does the vaccine not protect from an infection, it also does not protect anyone from infecting others. And it often seems to have massive side effects. Everything is scandalous – and not systematically revealed so far. Doctors fear the unimportant effort to submit the suspect of vaccine damage to the Paul-Ehrlich Institute. But they don’t do it because they have to be afraid to be put to the pranger as a “coronale deceiver.” Many people are currently seeking self-help.
2257	11	The so-called pandemic deserves the name panic pandemic. But as such it seems to be as valuable as gold, and therefore it should not go away.
2257	12	It looks like our politicians have long known what to say about both the alleged pandemic and the “measures”. While travellers in the train have to expect to be removed from the train, when they refuse the mask, politicians are immune to any virus, they just don’t let it go.
2257	14	Brav performs in the Bundestag or in the Federal Press Conference the ritual of climbing with a mask to the speaker's board, putting them down there and putting them back for the short walk. But then!
2257	16	Cem Özdemir at the study in the train – without a mask. And no, he has not been photographed in secret, he has posted the photo on his Twitter account. Justin Trudeau in close conversation with other politicians who face very close to each other, uncovered. The former chancellor in an intimate conversation with her adorer, the mirror journalist Alexander Osang: without a mask. You can even understand yourself a little better.
2257	18	and immediately. Quod licet jovi, non licet bovi. They terrorize the citizens and then repeatedly stick to none of the supposedly indispensable life-saving measures – this is usually called double morality. Consequently, the reactions come out of more and more people who were brave mask carriers until then. They have done everything so far, trusting in the right decisions of widespread politicians—which now show them the tongue.
2257	20	Because they know more than their subjects? Because they know how the report of the expert committee in which the coronation measures are to be assessed will come out? It seems as if there is no one measure that will go through effectively – except,, the masking in the interior. Therefore, Cem Özdemir is not out of the cutting.
2257	22	Let’s just take it as an example! Be like a Dutchman, be like a hundred!
2257	24	The freedom!
2258	1	Again a Burger War!

2264	1	Putin: Despite attempts to preserve the era of the unipolar world, it is now over – the ruling elite of the West lives in a dream world
2264	3	The Russian President holds his speech at the annual SPIEF Economic Forum in St. Petersburg. His speech is about the future of Russia and the rest of the world in the face of the re-pressure of Western sanctions against Moscow.
2264	5	In his speech at the International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg (SPIEF), Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that the unipolar world is at the end, although its beneficiaries tried to get it at any price. The President added that after the end of the Cold War, the United States had declared that its national interests are “healthy” and should not be undermined.
2264	7	The so-called “Golden Billion” still considers itself superior and sees the rest of the world as its colonies. He added that the ruling elites of the West live in a dream world and refuse to see the global changes.
2264	9	“In the last decades, new powerful centers have been formed on the planet... each of them has developed its own political system and its own public institutions, is implementing its own models of economic growth and, of course, has the right to protect itself and to guarantee national sovereignty. We speak here of real processes, of truly revolutionary, tectonic changes in geopolitics, world economy, technology, in the entire system of international relations.”
2264	11	Putin accused the Western countries of deliberately undermining the foundations of international order in order to satisfy their geopolitical illusions. He pointed out that the reputation of companies and trust in the currencies would be undermined by their actions. He also pointed out that the U.S. can steal the money of a person, group, or state only because Washington does not accept anything.
2264	13	EU has lost sovereignty, damages its citizens with anti-Russia sanctions
2264	15	The Russian president criticized the European Union for the decision to impose anti-Russia sanctions, calling it “many” and “not well-thinked”. Putin said the objective of the sanctions was to destroy the Russian economy by a blow, but it failed.
2264	17	Instead, the EU politicians had made a heavy blow to their own economy, leading to a high inflation, the president stressed. He estimated the cost of the “sanction madness” alone this year to approximately $400 billion and found that the measures would be a burden to the citizens.
2264	19	The Russian president said the EU lost its political sovereignty as its elites danced after the pipe of another country, even if this damages its own European populations and business interests. Putin predicted that this will lead to a deepening of financial inequalities and social divisions in European societies. It is possible that this will eventually lead to an increase in radicalism and a change of the elites in the block.
2264	21	Putin added that the global price rise and the problems in the energy sector are the direct result of a failed policy of the United States and the EU. The president rejected the terms “Putin’s tax” and “Putin’s inflation” used by Western politicians, especially U.S. President Joe Biden, to declare the rise in fuel and consumer prices. The Russian President claimed that only uneducated people would believe the stories that Russian actions in the Donbass drive the prices to the high.
2264	23	At the same time, Putin emphasized that the predictions of the Western countries about the darker prospects of the Russian economy were not made.
2264	25	“It’s clear why they’ve conducted this propaganda campaign, what it had to do with all the rumours about ruble-dollar exchange rates from 200 to 1 and the claims that our economy would collapse. All this was and is a means of informational warfare, a attempt to put the Russian society psychologically under pressure.”
2264	27	He emphasized that despite the sanctions, foreign pressure and the strategy of Russia to replace foreign imports with domestic production, the Russian economy will never become an autarchy – an isolated economy without or with only limited economic relations with abroad.
2264	29	to Ukraine
2264	31	The Russian President went separately to Ukraine, where Moscow is currently carrying out a special military operation. Putin promised that Russia will support the Ukrainians in the territories he controls and give them the opportunity to decide their fate, and that Moscow will respect this decision.
2264	33	He pointed out that military actions were always a tragedy, but stressed that Moscow was forced to act. The president added that the Russian special operation, unlike the U.S. actions in Libya or Iraq, is absolutely legitimate – a statement that denies the West.
2264	35	Putin continued his criticism of the United States by accusing it of building an anti-Russian base – something Washington would never tolerate in neighboring areas. The president continued that the White House had to push for new elections in Ukraine in 2014, instead of giving gifts to the opposition and supporting the February coup.
2264	37	The president also spoke about the course of the Russian special operations. He explained that the decisions on attacks on the decision-making centers of Ukraine, in particular on Kiev, are made by the military commander and not by him personally. He added that the Russian troops prevent the flooding of Ukrainian fortifications in Donetsk in order to avoid greater losses, and instead try to capture them. Putin added that the Ukrainian armed forces that have stumbled in these fortresses will use them to shoot civilian districts of the People's Republic of Donetsk.
2267	1	Are you prepared for the upcoming food disaster? 
2267	3	Experts and analysts around the world are now warning of explosive food prices and catastrophic food losses. In the middle of May 2022, the UN chief Antonio Guterres declared that the world is ahead of a year-long hunger, and called on Russia to “power the secure export of grain stored in Ukrainian ports” to alleviate the weakness.
2267	5	Officially, the fault for global food deficiency is attributed to the “climate change”, the COVID pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, although all of these factors have played a role, other factors also contribute to our food system to its boundaries.
2267	7	Death by a Thousand Cuts
2267	9	Thus, between January 2021 and April 2022, at least 20 food processing plants have fallen into flames, and a number of steel fires have also attracted farmers into compassion. While most of these fires were due to equipment or safety deficiencies and facts inspectors insist that fires occur frequently in this type of plants, there were only two such fires in 2019, and at least in some of the steel fires at the end of 2021, the fires were suspected.
2267	11	In 2020, forest fires also destroyed a number of farms, and at the beginning of 2022, bird flu eruptions in birds led to millions of chickens, dwarfs and dwarfs.
2267	13	In March 2021, a huge container ship drove into the Egyptian Suez Canal and blocked “a artery of world trade,” which caused an increase in oil prices and led to impacts on shipping around the globe.
2267	15	Recently, there has been a lack of baby food in the US, which has been caused by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closing one of the production sites that are part of the U.S. monopoly for baby food.
2267	17	In response to the EU’s decision to exclude seven of the nine Russian banks from the SWIFT system, Russia also suspends fertilizer exports, and whoever wants to buy Russian oil or gas must pay in rubles.
2267	19	In addition to the deficit of fertilizer caused by the Russian export ban and the resulting price rise, Union Pacific (whose main investors include BlackRock) also restricts fertilizer transportation by train, leading to delays in delivery and higher prices. Recently, a cargo train from the Canadian Pacific with Pottasche (an important fertilizer component) also dissolved in Alberta, Canada.
2267	21	President Biden’s decision to cut the United States from energy independence by suspending the Keystone Pipeline, terminating offshore oil package agreements in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, and freezing new package agreements and approvals for oil and gas supplies at federal level is also not helpful.
2267	23	We need fuel for agriculture and the transport of food and fertilizer, so rising prices on the shell automatically lead to higher expenditure for farmers and higher food prices. It is also not helpful or meaningful that the United States and the UK continue to pay the farmers for not growing or growing less when a global hunger is threatened. And let’s not forget the elephants in the room – the uncontrolled money printing – which is the real cause of inflation.
2268	1	UN Commissioner Filippo Grandi calls for double morality in treating refugees 
2268	3	United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, has pointed out the lack of support for non-Ukrainian refugees. Syria, Afghanistan and several African countries have also continued to need humanitarian aid, the UN spokesman said.
2268	5	U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, expressed concerns that by increasing the aid to Ukraine other regions in need worldwide could receive too little humanitarian support. He said this in an interview with NHK on Friday.
2268	7	Though Grandi supported the active collection of aid for refugees and domestic displaced persons in Ukraine, he was concerned about the lack of support for people in similar situations in Afghanistan, Syria and other countries in need:
2268	9	    “These funds may have been redirected by aid funds that were intended for other countries. The problems already existing in other regions are often ignored.”
2268	11	In view of the global nutritional problems, the UN Commissioner warned of a possible deterioration of the situation on the African continent:
2268	13	    “African prey regions are not only affected by conflicts and poverty, but also by climate change. If there is no food shortage, it is not to be surprising that more and more people are forced to leave.” 
2268	15	At the end of May, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees that the number of refugees and domestic displaced who were displaced from their homeland due to armed conflicts, violence and persecution, for the first time in the world, has exceeded the 100 million limit. The agency said the number of violent displaced people in the world has increased to 90 million by the end of 2021 due to new waves of violence or prolonged conflicts in states such as Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Nigeria.
2268	17	Furthermore, the military operation in Ukraine is expected to have displaced eight million people within the country by 2022, with more than six million refugees registered. The EU has responded unilaterally to the situation, Grandi added. He recalled how the EU countries had struggled about the reception of small groups of migrants who arrived by boats over the Mediterranean, and compared this situation to generosity towards refugees from Ukraine.
2269	1	Luisa Neubauer wants pipeline “to hunt into the air” 
2269	3	In an Instagram video, the German icon of the climate warriors flies about possible terrorist attacks on the African oil pipeline EACOP. The project is designed to supply East Africa with energy.
2269	5	And, of course, we’re thinking about how we can hunt the pipeline into the air.” – Luisa Neubauer and a rival laugh. These are scenes that upload the face of “Fridays for Future” to Instagram. New Builder is in Copenhagen to protest the construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipe Line (EACOP). “To blow up” – that can also be interpreted as “preventing” to get out.
2269	7	The bad joke has several dimensions. For how wise it is when one of the leading figures of climate extremism raises out such ideas towards a radical audience, it is an invitation in the light of the real events of attacks on everyday life. The new creator makes the Böhmerman: what you think is expressed, then thorned as a satir to be unreasonable – even though you actually mean what you say.
2269	9	The sound has become sharper since the Corona crisis stole the light and complicated the demonstrations. Neubauer and Greta Thunberg are no longer as present as before. Clear claims must be made. The mirror was given to climate extremist Andreas Malm, who used the reach of the Hamburger magazine for a force call in the name of his ideology. This also fits the new creator’s saloppe idea completely in the spirit of time.
2269	11	The pipeline is intended for the Third World. It is intended to pump oil from the Indian Ocean to Uganda, where a refinery will supply the east African coast. Uganda is considered one of the poorest countries in the world. The pipeline building will provide 15,000 people work, and after completion the project will provide 1,000 to 2,000 permanent jobs. Cheap energy will become a springboard for the region. The pipeline is considered the longest heated raw oil pipeline in the world.
2269	13	This is not the case with Luisa Neubauer. Climate conservation is greater than the development of the region. It is a new form of colonialism that will ask the Africans this time how they have to solve their energy problems. And finally, whoever is excited about it when the Federal Chancellor makes the climate movement associated with totalitarian phenomena, and stylizes himself as a victim of Nazi similarities, shouldn’t swallow about terrorist acts in the public. That Neubauer then also has the chuse to appeal to the same-name book by Malm, which is considered the predecessor of armed eco-terrorism, Bände says what Neubauer really thinks.
2270	1	Western sanctions make the opposite: Russia's energy revenue is higher than before the war
2270	3	The western anti-Russia policy aims to sustainably harm the Russian economy through sanctions and the refusal of further Russian energy imports. Federal Foreign Minister Baerbock (Greenland) expressly stated in February the objective of the measures to “ruin” Russia.
2270	5	After about a hundred days of war in Ukraine, it turns out that the Western sanctions are a smooth bumerang. They have not only carried out acute energy disruptions in the West, but also made the Russian oil and gas revenue more powerful than ever before. According to a U.S. government representative, the Russian energy revenue is currently higher than just before the Ukrainian war. The reason for this is that the worldwide price rise has impacted the effects of Western sanctions on restricting energy sales, said U.S. Special Envoy for Energy Security, Amos Hochstein, during a hearing.
2270	7	In addition, the increase in global oil demand by consumers in the course of the weakening of the “corona” pandemic has been stronger than expected. This also led to price shifts. At the same time, Russia was able to sell oil with discounts to other consumers. 
2275	1	Vladimir Putin: Why does he hate Russia so much? 
2275	3	Moscow (dpo) - Russia's economy on the ground, the ruble in the free case, thousands of young soldiers killed, international isolation: These are just some of the results of the attack war against Ukraine. Reason enough to ask the question: Why does Vladimir Putin hate Russia so much that he is so willing to hurt him?
2275	5	“All Putin’s behavior now indicates that he wants to destroy Russia and the future of the people living there as sustainably as possible and for decades,” explains psychologist and conflict researcher Bastian Fenten. “It would be his task as president to ensure that the Russian people are well. Instead, he seems to hate it abruptly.”
2275	7	What is Putin’s hatred of Russia? Has Russia done something bad to him in the past? Did he take away the bread every day? Overcome your dog? Is Putin a double leader of the West? Or is anti-Russian racism the cause that it let its peoples die and leads to poverty?
2275	9	It only seems clear: a spontaneous misvaluation of the situation cannot be a reason for Putin’s actions. If so, he would be able to end the war immediately and withdraw his troops. Instead, he seems to intensify his war efforts and the accompanying strikes and thus further worsen Russia’s situation,” Fenten said.
2275	11	No matter what the reason for Putin’s irrational hatred of Russia and everything Russian may be: there remains hope that he will be stopped soon before he does even worse to the Russians. After all, the man has nuclear bombs.
2284	1	Trudeau: “He behaves like a tyrant, like a dictator”
2284	3	Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau behaves like a tyrant, like a dictator, Romanian European Deputy Cristian Terhes said on Friday at a press conference. “He behaves like Ceausescu in Romania,” he said.
2284	5	“When a person sits doubts about vaccines, he is scared. What’s the difference between what he is doing now and what happened at the time of the Inquisition?” asked Terhes.
2284	7	On the one hand they say you should not believe in God, but on the other hand they say you should believe in science. In science, it is not about faith, but about measurements, conclusions, hypotheses and arguments. We are now arriving at a point where you will be drawn up when you have doubts,” the deputy said. “It’s not okay.”
2284	9	Terhes spoke with a number of Canadian trucks, to whom he thanked at the press conference. “I hope that this freedom movement will spread throughout the world, because we must ensure that all the elected people understand that they have been chosen to work for the people and not to behave like slave holders.”
2284	11	"Previously, Tesla’s chief Elon Musk compared Trudeau to Hitler. He did this in a tweet, which he soon dissolved. Musk posted a picture of Hitler with the text ""Do not compare me with Justin Trudeau. I had a budget.” The government of the Canadian Prime Minister has not presented a budget for 2019 and 2020."
2287	1	A failed growth model
2287	2	Alliances and activists demonstrate at the G7 summit against climate change, war and injustice
2287	4	The Münchner Theresienwiese to the lunchtime on Saturday: A activist dressed as a Pandabar holds a shield up before the stage. “Energy transition is right now,” it is to be read. Behind it, the earth ball flows as an air balloon under the blue sky and on it is written “Climate Save!” It is a large alliance that has gathered here to protest. Attac is also involved as the Federation of Nature Conservation, Oxfam Germany, Greenpeace, Campact, Misereor as well as the Action Against Hunger. The appeals are addressed to the heads of state and government who meet in the framework of the G7 summit near the Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Castle Elmau.
2287	6	With a demonstration through the city centre of Munich, the alliance of 15 civil society organizations calls for a decisive action against the climate crisis and species death. “We will go on the streets and continue to fight until we live in a climate-righteous world,” says Lisa Göldner of Greenpeace. 
2287	8	On the stage, under the motto “G7 – Justice goes different” the representatives of youth organizations make mobile. Beccy of the Federal Nature Conservation BN-Youth calls for a system change rather than climate change. Ilayda of the WWF youth says, “I’m afraid of our future,” and Luca of the Nature Conservation youth NaJu Bayern says, “We must not only speak but act.” The G7 calls on responsibility for a “binding agreement on climate and species protection.” Viviane Raddatz from the WFF asks: “What do you do to get faster in climate and nature protection?”The solutions were there, but would be implemented too slowly. It requires binding decisions to get out of coal and gas.
2287	10	In addition to climate change and species protection, the war in Ukraine is also a topic of debate. “Imperialism begins here: Let’s attack it,” is read on a banner of the Black Block. In advance of the G7 summit, fire attacks on police cars were occurring in Munich, distant from which the “Stop G7 Elmau” alliance. “Closing the war,” stands on another banner; “Solidarity with the Ukrainian workers and masses” on a poster.
2287	12	Climate change and war, that was also the motivation for the 29-year-old Max and his 27-year-old companion Hendrik from Leipzig to Munich to come to the big demo. Max studies Lehramt and says: “I thought we shouldn’t deal with war anymore, now we’re very close to it.” And yes, he already believes that “the demo brings something,” that you’ve seen in “Fridays for Future.” Also in the protests in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen against the politics of the seven state leaders, the two want to be present.
2287	14	The width of the alliance against the G7 makes different statements clear before the big demonstration. Elisabeth Waizenegger from the Working Community Farm Farm and Milk Farmers from Bavaria explains: “G7 countries, finally say goodbye to your failed agricultural world market orientation! We need regional systems worldwide that provide foresters with prospects, make everyone tired and protect the climate and biodiversity – with fair prices and fair access to land and seed.”
2287	16	Roland Süß, a member of the Attac Coordination Circle, said: “The G7 is hoping for a failed growth model that it will force the rest of the world. The result is social division – worldwide. To resolve the multiple global crises, we need a multilateralism beyond the national logic that gives a decisive influence to the Global South.” 
2287	18	"Sven Hilbig of Bread for the World says: “The G7 is jointly responsible for many current crises and the progressive exploitation of the Global South. We do not need the club culture of the industrial nations, but a fair development policy and structural changes that will be carried by the entire state community.""And Christine Margraf from the Federation of Nature Conservation in Bavaria states: ""Beyond the Earth's warming, species death is the biggest global crisis of our planet. The G7 countries must finally put the foundation for the conclusion of a binding global agreement on the preservation of biodiversity this year.”"
2287	20	According to the organizers, 6,000 people participated in the demonstration. At the G7 summit in Elmau seven years ago there were still 40,000 participants.
229	1	Riding against Putin
229	3	"There are many good reasons to ride more often and not so often or not so quickly with the car. Everything has been gifted and hard-declinated for decades. Currently, a very bad argument is added: wheel or pace 100 "" against Putin"". Robert Habeck spoke to the Funke media group shortly before Easter: “Every kilometre not in danger is a contribution to the ease of Russian energy supplies. We protect the climate above.” (And, so much chuzpe must be, it “save the pocket.”)"
229	5	Neither the one nor the other of Habeck’s arguments are true. First, you make yourself a fool when you make a target of the state to the maximum of your own actions. For the “contra-Putin” cycling or tricking is confessing to be a self-confident red in a great “national power effort”. A contradiction. Secondly, the idea of damaging Putin with the fuel saved by wheels or trolls is as doubtful in its effectiveness as all the acts of the so-called consumer resistance. For it would be, even if millions would join it, a typical Ceteris-paribus assessment: the expected effect would come (maybe) if nothing would change in the other framework conditions.
229	7	But do it, and it is from the side of those who tell people this foolishness. This does not have the smallest impact on the bicycle. What a war like that in Ukraine, including its extension by western weapons supplies with global CO2 emissions, has for good reason never anyone even tried to calculate. The answer is so clear that the underlying question is ridiculous. War and climate are a topic that the green climate and war-friends like to cover extensively.
2290	1	The Bank on Fundamental Rights
2290	2	The criticism of Elon Musk’s grip on Twitter shows that the highly cited democratic basic values, at least in toning editions, are partly history.
2290	4	Irre: There’s someone who announces to engage in an influential position for freedom of speech and speech on the Internet, and not only in Germany, large media are attacking him. Moralism and self-righteousness have become so discourse dominant that a democratic basic principle of dismissal is released. This was recently shown in the report on Elon Musk’s plans to take over Twitter and censor less there. The point of criticism was said, among other things, that the ideas of a rich white man about freedom of speech are suspicious in the light of the declines that minorities have to experience online and offline again and again. Moreover, Musk is a great capitalist who knows what plans are.
2290	6	Whoever rejects an acquisition of Twitter by Musk because of fear of the announced freedom of speech, has already two blind spots. First, this freedom is scandalously restricted on Twitter, and second, the freedom of speech and speech of our era is based on the capitalist impulse to incarnate old-fledged illnesses.
2290	8	The censorship scandal
2290	10	Those who have not criticized Twitter for their censorship measures have missed or forgotten important events on the platform. In the topic of coronavirus, the cutting of the social discourse has only reached a new extent. Thus, some tweets that questioned the benefits of the Corona vaccines claimed by governments or spoke of vaccine damage could not be spread, not even answered – even if they linked a scientific study or a government statement, or even contained a simple question.
2290	12	The social network Facebook has been accessed publicly since January by the renowned British Medical Journal. From the beginning, the magazine had published critical articles on the declarability of the approval studies for the Corona vaccines by Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna, and one of them was provided on Facebook with a warning and the threat that anyone who repeatedly blames such a thing is at risk of being blocked. Facebook’s sister platform Instagram blocked in November 2021 the mention of the profile of the scientific Cochrane network, which has a worldwide reputation because it has set standards for the evaluation of medical studies. Cochrane has repeatedly published content that is contrary to the guidelines on false content on COVID-19 or vaccines. All of these censorship measures are scientific hostile.
2290	14	Social media as a policy
2290	16	The suspicion is that Twitter and Facebook have sabotaged criticism of the fundamental rights provisions of the past two years because they benefit from the officially ordered online communication. However, the censorship problem exists independently. Three weeks before the last U.S. presidential election in 2020, both platforms prevented the link to an article in the New York Post. On the basis of ancient e-mails from Hunter Biden, the son of today’s President Joe Biden, he suggested that Hunter had only received a lucrative position at an Ukrainian energy company so that his father, then U.S. Vice President, was engaged in the Ukrainian government in the sense of that company – what Joe Biden then did, whether intentionally or not. Twitter chief Jack Dorsey described this censorship more than a month later – that is, after the presidential election – as an error. His platform had deactivated the profile of the New York Post for two weeks. Twitter censorship in 2019 was a topic in the German Bundestag. Before the elections to the European Parliament, the platform had published guidelines against political misinformation and then blocked meaningless tweets. This meeting was attended by SPD politicians and the newspaper “Jewische Allgemeine”.
2290	18	Elon Musk’s criticism of censorship on Twitter is quite recommended. However, criticizing his concepts of (opinion) freedom as an expression of capitalist mentality is faulty. Capitalism, because of all our equality before money and goods, has placed the basis for the modern understanding of fundamental rights. Liberalism is the related building of thought, which, however, is independent of its capitalist foundation and has enabled a generalization of fundamental rights. He has developed his own life, as it happens with political ideas. And it is often useful against existing illnesses.
2290	20	If, for example, as in the US, economic liberal institutions since 2020 gather large amounts of data and studies on the topics of coronavirus and coronapolitics that speak against fundamental rights and direct or indirect vaccination, then these data should not be dismissed from (anticapitalist) principle. On the contrary, precisely in Germany, where the government has not yet evaluated the successes and failures of the bad provisions of fundamental law, we are even dependent on such contributions.
2291	1	 The main questions and answers about Finland and Sweden’s NATO accession 
2291	3	Now the way is free: Finland and Sweden will soon become members of NATO. But what exactly does that mean? What does that have to do with Russia? Oh God, please do not ask so stupidly, we will explain it to you in detail! Here are the main questions and answers about Finland and Sweden’s NATO accession:
2291	5	Where are Sweden and Finland?
2291	7	Finland and Sweden are located in northern Europe. As geographers say, “full up on the map.” They are located on both sides of the Bottish Sea Basin and thus directly in the European epicenter of the angular geographical wordwitch.
2291	9	What is NATO?
2291	11	The NATO (abbreviation for North AtlaNtic TreATy OrganizatiOn) is a pure defense alliance (with a maximum of provoking, pushing and knitting), which was originally established as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO has long had no equal opponent and therefore focused on smaller robbery and kidnapping crimes, before finally an interesting despot with Vladimir Putin appeared again.
2291	13	What is NATO?
2291	15	An extrawurst for the French who like to express abbreviations backward (cf. ASU, FECINU, UE, GfM and BACA.
2291	17	Why did Sweden and Finland not join NATO?
2291	19	Fear of Russia.
2291	21	Why do Sweden and Finland now suddenly want to join NATO?
2291	23	Fear of Russia.
2291	25	What is the military performance of the two countries?
2291	27	Finland and Sweden each have a strong army. Particularly feared are the famous Swedish Elch-Husars (50,000) as well as Matti Hämäläinen from Helsinki, who is simply a pretty scary guy.
2291	29	Can I become a member of NATO? How much does it cost?
2291	31	Theoretically, any member of NATO can become a member unless he lives too far from the North Atlantic and promises to invest two percent of his salary in weapons. Membership forms are available only at the NATO headquarters in Brussels.
2291	33	How will Sweden and Finland be adopted?
2291	35	After all NATO members have agreed, the two new members must only submit to the traditional, somewhat archaic reception ritual. It appears that Sweden and Finland must be naked and blind to all the previous Member States, while they have paddles on their back.
2291	37	What did Erdogan get for his approval?
2291	39	For him the admission of the two candidates failed several weeks ago: Recep Erdogan. According to the assumption, the Turkish president made his current agreement expensive: Finland and Sweden must massage his feet twice a week, serve snacks and drinks at Zurup and keep the freeze as the rest of the NATO pleases if Turkey once again bombs the Kurds.
2291	41	But what Erdogan did not think about: once Sweden and Finland are in the NATO, they can withdraw all consent back. For whoever once is in NATO can no longer be thrown out. and Pssst! But Erdogan does not know that yet.
2291	43	in exceptional way. But only this once.
2291	45	Can this FAQ article contain the answer above and the question below?
2291	47	Why should Sweden and Finland join the NATO but not Ukraine?
2291	49	This has two important reasons. On the one hand, Sweden and Finland do not have a sufficiently large Russian minority to push Russia up and build up into a separatist state to then rush to help it. On the other hand, Russia is currently unable to attack Sweden and Finland because it is too busy bombing Ukraine because it wanted to join NATO.
2291	51	How does Russia react to the two countries' candidacy?
2291	53	"Due to the ""special operation"" in Ukraine, Russia currently has too much around the ears to react properly to this confrontation. However, Finland and Sweden each received a voucher for nuclear destruction and general destruction, which they may settle from 2025."
2294	1	Pride instead of Pride
2294	3	Once the largest queere parade in Southeast Europe, now a symbol of repression. As in recent years, the Istanbul Pride Week was banned. It should be from 20 to 26. June takes place, with a colourful program consisting of lectures, discussion rounds and speeddating events, to conclude with a large parade on Sunday.
2294	5	Governors of the Istanbul districts Kadiköy and Beyoglu stated that after police inspections of the sites for the 30th Annual Pride Week, they decided not to allow events on the street or in buildings. “All events are banned in all open and closed areas for seven days,” the governor’s office said in a statement. The ban was justified by the prevention of crimes and the preservation of peace and security. “After the Taksim-Gezi-Park protests in 2013, we all decided that ‘resistance’ should be the theme of the Pride Week,” Es Yılmaz, a spokesman for the Istanbul LGBTI+ Pride Week Committee said on Wednesday to the young world.
2294	7	The people who want to celebrate the LGBTI+ Pride Week are not only exposed to state repression and police attacks, but religious and fanatic groups are also mobilizing against them. The group Müdafaa-i Islam Hareketi (the Islam Defense Movement) called on to gather in Taksim this Sunday, the day of the Pride Parade, at 14:53. “Protect your family, generation and city,” the group wrote on Monday in a message on Twitter, commented with numerous murder threats against LGBTI+ persons.
2294	9	After a large Pride parade with more than 100,000 participants in 2014, the Turkish authorities have always banned the move over the past years – officially for security reasons. The Pride Week 2014 was the largest LGBTI+ event in the history of Turkey and attracted more than 100,000 people. In 2015, the Pride events were banned and our fairy tales were blocked by the police,” Yilmaz complained in a jW interview. Hundreds of people had opposed the ban and were attacked by the police with drinking gases, protective shields, pepper gases and plastic shots.
2294	11	The repressive, right-conservative spirit of the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara is also spreading in the 15 million inhabitants metropolis of Istanbul. “They are responsible for all the violence we experience,” Yilmaz said in a jW interview. “LGBTI+ does not exist,” the Turkish president said. Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu described homosexuals as “perverse”, “a senior health officer compared us to pedophiles, and the top Imam warned that we spread diseases,” Yilmaz said. The government has arrested thousands of Kurdish politicians, human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists. “The Turkish government also takes LGBTI+ communities into vision, but we refuse to give little.”
2294	13	"The Istanbul LGBTI+ Pride Week Committee issued a statement on social media on Tuesday after the ban decision. “The orders tried to press the events by requesting documents such as tax signs and signs for the events where the event would take place. Despite the pressure, we met today at our locations.""The committee stated that the ban is illegal and will ""use all rights and submit the necessary objection."""

2296	1	Sexism in Political Business
2296	3	As a “fate choice” it will be for the 10th. In July in Japan planned Supreme House elections are occasionally marked – each half of the House members are renamed by ageing every three years. The reason for this is the plans of the right to put hands on the peace constitution with a two-thirds majority. The hope of the Pacificists is now stronger on women among the “middle-left” candidates. So the left-liberal daily newspaper Nikkan Gendai hopes in its last Sunday edition of a “turn of Madonna”, which should prevent the right-wing forces in the Supreme House from reaching the two-thirds majority needed for a constitutional change.
2296	5	In fact, this time more candidates have been nominated than ever before: 181, which corresponds to 33 percent of all candidates. For the conservative Japan, the numbers are extremely high, considering that in the higher doted under house, only about 10 percent of the members of the parliament are female. Japan is among 188 countries only 165. and Rang.
2296	7	Until the 2009 sub-House elections, women’s percentage in parliament continued to rise before they began to stagnate. Many Japanese still believe that women belonged to the sheep and they kept the high employment of a politician from family duties. Moreover, a subtle sexism takes through the society, which does not stand before politics.
2296	9	This is the case of Ayaka Shiomura 2014. The then parliamentary member of Tokyo spoke in a plenary session about the need to better support women with children in order to increase birth rates, as a colleague from the Liberal Democratic Government Party (LDP) said: “You should marry yourself.”
2296	11	Investigations show that the incident was only the top of the ice mountain. Sexist comments from politicians are rather a rule than an exception. In early June, Nikkan Gendai a parliamentary of the right-wing Japanese Innovation Party who presented a candidate with the words: “If you would take the beauty of her face as a measure, she would be the number one.” Also indicating that the parties like to recruit Japanese women who have become known through television or sports. This is not the person, but the image care.
2296	13	“Not least, the election campaign is an obstacle to the political career of a woman,” said Shiomura, who has been sitting for the left-liberal KDP in the Oberhaus for three years. June to JW. This lasts about two and a half weeks this year: the candidates stand from morning to evening at temperatures of up to 40 degrees on the squares and in front of the railway stations and try to gain the attention of passengers through fireful speeches. Most of all, women go to the limits of their loadability: three years ago she suffered a weakness three times, twice failed her voice, Shiomura complained.
2296	15	“And if women go to parliament, they have to fight with male bureaucracy,” she said. The parliament is managed by men, they decide who should talk about what topics. However, Shiomura, who came into politics on the topic of animal protection, could put accents in some areas such as fertility treatment and abortion.
2296	17	Whether this time the increase in women’s rates among the candidates by about five percent points compared to 2019 means the beginning of a new trend, the next sub-house elections will probably show. At least with the LDP, however, there has not been a reflection yet: your candidate ratio is disappointing with 23 percent.
