231	1	How Macron and his clique trade unemployment figures
231	3	As by chance, a few days after a second round where Marine Le Pen suddenly became a Nazi, the unemployment figures miraculously decreased by 600,000, nothing less, and the media collabos to extase again on our “Mozart of the Economy” which has served us as president for five years. Except that...
231	4	Here is a quick explanation of how the Insee, on Macron’s order and his clique, tricks and falsifies real unemployment figures.
231	5	It must be known that the Insee makes its figures by conducting an investigation of only 110,000 people (although the active population is 29 million people in France!) Then by carrying out dark “correction” (which they call “weight”) to produce the final number.
231	6	But in 2021, the Insee changed its investigation and weighting:
231	7	The Employment Survey is renewed in 2021: reasons for its re-design to impacts on the measurement of employment and unemployment (INSEE ANALYSES, No 65, 29/06/2021)
231	8	HTTPS://www.insee.fr/fr/statistics/5402123
231	9	In the middle of this article, the Insee reveals that this new version has “magically” increased the employment rate of 15-64 years of age by 0.8% (which corresponds to 270,000 more employees), and the employment rate of women by 1.4%. In short, we change the questionnaire and weight, and hop, the employment rate increases, so the unemployment rate decreases!
231	10	Let’s remember that it has been for years that the increasing differences between the figures of the Insee (used by the government and the media) and those of the Employment Pole are known:
231	11	Unemployment: Why the Insee and Employment Pole figures differ 24-08-17
231	12	HTTPS://www.lemonde.fr/les-decoders/article/2017/08/24/chomage-why-les-digits-de-l-insee-et-de-pole-employment-different_5176176_4355770.html
231	13	Extract from this article:
231	14	“In 2013, the Insee changed the questionnaires of its Employment Survey. After the reformulation at the margins of some questions, the answers have been profoundly changed. Thus, an Insee investigator will no longer ask you if you were “seeking a job, even part-time or occasionally,” but if you were “seeking a job” all the time.
231	15	Together with others, this change was enough to get some “yes” to the “no” side. The Institute’s experts estimated, in March 2014, that the new questionnaire artificially reduced the unemployment rate by 0.5 points, which is 145,000 unemployed less. »
231	16	Unemployment figures are tricked.
231	17	And that, without counting that in September 2021, the state gave the order to the SNCF to employ “young” in masses in HR (Human Relations) jobs, i.e. unprofitable jobs, created to artificially reduce the number of unemployed, debting even more to the SNCF. This information was given to me personally by the director of an important branch of the SNCF network at the beginning of October; she was shocked by this request from the government.
231	18	It is likely that other public companies have received such an order.
231	19	While Macron and his clique falsify the real, the French economy declines even more.
23104	1	"""The EU's climate strategy is preparing to increase global deforestation"""
23104	3	Three scientists, Denis Couvet, Wolfgang Cramer and Timothy Searchinger, warn about the EU’s climate policy, which intends to dedicate 20% of the cultivated land to bioenergy, and to multiply wood imports.
23104	5	To avoid catastrophic climate change and the loss of biodiversity, climate science warns us that humanity must stop transforming forests into agricultural lands, as this process releases carbon dioxide and destroys habitats. However, as the world’s population, income and meat consumption are increasing, agricultural lands are expanding at an increasing pace. Europe has contributed to this deforestation by externalizing its food and other agricultural products supply.
23104	7	Unfortunately, the EU’s climate strategy “Fit for 55” (a legislative package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55%) is preparing to extend Europe’s footprint and increase global deforestation. Therefore, a group of scientists from all over Europe calls on the European Parliament to amend the plan by reasonable amendments (some are already adopted by one of its committees).
23104	9	Large amounts of productive land
23104	11	The plan aims to dedicate one-fifth of Europe’s cultivated land to bioenergy by 2050. In addition, burning wood imports to produce energy will be multiplied by four, which is an annual volume equivalent to approximately 40% of the total annual wood harvest in Canada, the world’s second-largest wood exporter.
23104	13	Collecting and burning more trees increases the amount of carbon in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries. This is true even if we let the trees grow back and even if wood replaces coal (the dirtyest fuel used for energy).
23104	15	"The central problem is attributable to a systemic error of thinking in silo: the plan ignores the effects of bioenergy production on the climate and nature. Biomass combustion releases more carbon than fossil fuels, but these emissions are ignored. The theory wants this carbon to be removed from the air when plants grow, so that plant burning does not add ""clean"" carbon to the air."
23105	1	Variants of Covid: reboot or seasonal virus?
23105	3	With the arrival and the very majority of circulation of BA.4 and BA.5 on the French territory, the number of contaminations starts to rise. How do we analyze this recovery? The responses of epidemiologists Catherine Hill and Antoine Flahault.
23105	5	The epidemic is not seasonal. More and more infectious variants succeed and continue to make the virus circulate by waves.
23105	7	Catherine Hill Epidemiologist at the Gustave-Roussy Institute (Villejuif)
23105	9	If some think Covid’s epidemic is seasonal, it’s probably by analogy with the influenza epidemic. But it is enough to look at the evolution of Covid mortality in the northern hemispheric countries and in the southern hemispheric countries to see that the peak observed in the north does not match the hole observed in the south. We can also compare the dates of the peak between two countries in the same hemisphere, for example South Africa and Brazil, to see that in Brazil the most important peak occurred in mid-April 2021, a time when very little deaths were observed in South Africa.
23105	11	There were three pics in Brazil, in July 2020, April 2021 and February 2022, and four pics in South Africa, in August 2020, January 2021, July 2021 and February 2022. In France, there were seven pics, in April 2020, November 2020, February 2021, March 2021, August 2021, February 2022, and April 2022, thus at all seasons.
23105	13	The epidemic is actually governed by the spread of more and more contagious variants that spread from one country to another depending on the circulation of people. Thus, the Omicron’s BA.2 variant quickly became dominant in France, succeeding the Omicron’s BA.1 variant, which himself succeeded the Delta variant.
23105	15	Omicron’s BA.4 and BA.5 variants are arriving in France, they already accounted for 46% of viruses from June 5 to 11, according to crawling data, and their relative frequency is rapidly increasing. We have passed from 45% BA.2 to 75% BA.2 in two weeks, so we can expect to have 75% BA.4 or BA.5.
23105	17	Can we talk about recovery? Redemption supposes stop, but there has not been a stop of the epidemic: as in the rest of the world, the Sars-CoV-2 has never ceased to circulate in France. The evolution of this circulation can be studied from several indicators: the number of positive cases, the number of patients arriving at the hospital or in resuscitation and the number of deaths.
23105	19	Regardless of the indicator, the circulation of the virus has been made by successive waves, with highs and lows, highs becoming less and less high because the population is partially protected from risks by vaccination or an earlier infection, the protection is better against the most serious risks, i.e. the risks of resuscitation and the risks of death.
23105	21	However, the variants BA.4 and BA.5, which arrived in Portugal earlier than in France, are associated in this country with a significant increase in mortality.
23105	23	The same phenomenon can therefore be expected in France, even worse as 11% of the French population of 80 years and older has not been vaccinated at all, while in Portugal the vaccination coverage of the population of 60 years and older is 100%.
23105	25	This has not ended with the pandemic. The current wave that, after touching Portugal, flows over Europe testifies to a reboot.
23105	27	Antoine Flahault Epidemiologist, Director of the Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva (Swiss)
23105	29	"At the end of each wave, the voices of experts and politicians raise to explain, in a very optimistic tone, that this time we have finished well. Let us remember the first wave, after the terrible first confinement. After the summer we had found life almost ""as before"", the second wave required another confinement. We then hoped, thanks to the good news about the arrival of a vaccine, that we would have ended this pandemic. But the Alpha variant would counteract the plans of our favourite calmers and require a new confinement, which this time would be the last."
23105	31	Does this mean that the pandemic has ended since June 2021? Unfortunately, the Delta wave spread across Europe and the world. The vaccine would change the situation. As we came out at the beginning of December of what was going to be our last experience with this pandemic, we see the new variant Omicron disappearing in South Africa, at the beginning of their southern summer. It was so transmissible that nothing stopped it and we had hardly reached the peak of the Delta wave, mid-December, that Omicron was going to spread throughout Europe without leaving us any rest.
23105	33	Omicron is a numerous family and each of the subvariants has its own character. BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5 We don’t believe that there would be “only” five children in the Omicron family. The North American today are discussing a subvariant called BA.2.12.1, which means that the subvariant BA.2 has already had at least 12 subvariants. It travels to Martinique, which is currently experiencing the highest incidences and mortality to the population.
23105	35	So no, we haven’t finished with Covid. We would like it, but the waves seem to be bound with an accelerated pace.
23105	37	It seems that BA.5 leads the race to the top in Western Europe. The wave caused in Portugal – and its deadline – now extends to the subcontinent and to the metropolitan France. The Portuguese are remarkably vaccinated, they still wear the mask in public transport, so there are few reasons to think that the French will get better out of it. It is important to note that 93% of mortality during this BA.5 wave in Portugal affected people over the age of 80. The remaining 7% were the few non-vaccinated or insufficiently vaccinated people, immunodepressed by their treatments or diseases.
23105	39	So, if you want to call this “seasonal” virus free to you, but what season are we talking about? Didn’t we ever use this expression for flu viruses and winter colds? If we look at the Covid of the last twelve months, it’s rather the four seasons that we have played this virus and its subvariant orchestra: I’d say rather reboot, you’ve understood it!
23109	1	Right to abortion threatened in the U.S.: send them back the stick in full figure
23109	3	They will never leave women quiet. The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to cancel the historic ruling recognizing, for almost a half-century, the right to abortion. The project that has escaped is to be taken with the greatest of seriousness: we don’t see how it could not be confirmed by this net conservative majority court since the remodeling carried out by Donald Trump.
23109	5	The fundamental right of women to interrupt pregnancy in the so-called “freedom” country can therefore be challenged. Women will be subject to the goodwill of the state in which they live and half of them are ready to attack the IVG. Not less. Simone de Beauvoir said, “Do not forget that a political, economic or religious crisis will be enough to question women’s rights. These rights are never acquired. You’ll have to stay vigilant throughout your life.”American women advance the theory of backlash: every advance in women’s rights was followed by a reactionary offensive, demonstrated in 1991 the feminist journalist Susan Faludi in a constantly up-to-date trial.
23109	7	The rebound, the feminists were waiting for it since MeToo in 2017. This is here. Can it not be returned in full? Between resistance and resistance, what word do you prefer? We must defend our rights in the elections. Joe Biden called for it, from the mid-Mandat elections in November. We must defend our rights on the street. Since Monday night, hundreds of protesters have massed in front of the American law temple, facing the “pro-life”. They will need to be defended alongside associations whose importance is overlooked in the face of such news. Reinstalling this force ratio is an imperative, in the United States, in Europe as well, where Ukrainian victims of rape are currently prohibited from having access to the IVG in Poland, but also elsewhere, everywhere.
23109	9	They will never leave women quiet. But we will never let them come back calmly.
2311	1	Conference on the Future of Europe: a simulator of participative democracy?
2311	3	If there is a lesson to remember from the Conference on the Future of Europe which has just concluded is that regardless of the circumstances (war, health crises, economic marasms or catastrophic precedents), there will always be a handful of irreductibles for whom the salvation of the continent passes only through a long and sinueous reform of the treaties. When, in addition, these irreductibles conceive and pilot a custom consultation by drapping it out of the horizons of a large “city consultation” which (oh surprise!) Their political objectives are fulfilled, and they are overwhelming. And we run the risk of engraving Europe in Byzantine debates and endless ratifications at the most inappropriate time possible.
2311	5	Through a communication pass, this Conference is presented today as a cry from the heart of European citizens that has led to a clear mandate to reform Europe from the bottom to the bottom and to further integrate it. But in fact, it is nothing. From the beginning, this consultation almost did not take place. Initially, this idea was promptly pushed by Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and federalist assumed. He and his group (Renew, where also the members of the Republic are sitting in March) made it one of the conditions for Ursula von der Leyen’s election, and that accessed it, between the annoyance and indifference of the Member States. A few months later, the Covid rebounded all the cards and this conference, in turn of the emergencies and needs of the crisis, lost all its interest... except for the Parliament that has not demolished it. The commitment was, therefore, to launch a one-year consultation open to all Europeans and whose contributions would be channeled through a virtual platform and citizens’ groups.
2311	7	In itself, the intention was praiseful but, as we could expect, this process did not passionate the crowds and hardly mobilized beyond the very limited circles of initiates to European affairs. All, in the general (and very logical) indifference of citizens suffering from the health and economic crisis, and whose priorities were (and remain!) the antipods of the institutional issues that passionate the Brussels scenes. At the end, a very disappointing score with figures cheating the eye: five million visitors on the platform, 53,000 active visitors, 18,000 suggestions sent and 6,600 discussions organized in a year. Data processed by an algorithm attributing the same statistical weight to a “like” as to an event of a hundred participants and who tried to release major opinions from a very limited sample and spread, often, of the most safrened ideas. For example, the most popular suggestion in the category Rights and Values (with the mirroring score of 915 likes) is to recognize Catalan among the official languages of the EU.
23112	1	G7: Ukraine, climate, food insecurity... What should be remembered from the summit announcement
23112	3	"It is a summit widely devoted to Ukraine, but also to other topics, such as China and climate. The seven G7 forces gathered at the summit in Bavaria, Germany, want to make Russia pay a maximum cost for its invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose country presides the G7 this year, said on Tuesday 28 June, reaffirming that ""Putin should not win this war."""
23112	5	“G7 remains united in its support for Ukraine,” Olaf Scholz said at a press conference after the G7 summit. “We will continue to maintain and increase the economic and political costs of this war for President (Vladimir) Putin and his regime,” he added.
23112	7	The seven powers of the G7 also committed on Tuesday after their meeting to “support” the “rebuilding of Ukraine through a conference and an international reconstruction plan,” according to a draft final statement consulted by the AFP. The G7, which has joined five emerging countries, including India, has also condemned the “illegal” invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
23112	9	Emmanuel Macron said that “Russia cannot and should not win” the war in Ukraine. “Russia cannot and must not win and therefore our support to Ukraine and our sanctions against Russia will remain as long as necessary and with the necessary intensity in the coming weeks and months,” he said at a press conference at the end of the summit.
23112	11	The Creation of a “Climate Club”
23112	13	"In addition, the leaders of the G7 agreed on the creation of a ""climate club"" aimed at strengthening and expanding cooperation in the fight against climate warming, according to a joint statement published Tuesday after their summit in Germany. This climate club will be a ""big ambition intergovernmental forum"" open to all countries, the seven leaders explain. “We invite our partners, including major emitters, G20 members and other developing and emerging economies, to intensify discussions and consultations with us,” the statement continued."
23112	15	This institution, led by Germany, aims in particular to bring together the countries that accept common rules to avoid competitive disadvantages. These countries would jointly set ambitious goals and exempt each other from climate-related trade tariffs to which non-members would be subjected. It would include agreement on carbon pricing standards or uniform regulations on green hydrogen.
23112	17	"The leaders of the G7 also accused China of ""practices that mislead the world economy"" and said they want to cooperate in sharing information about the actions of this type of enterprise by Beijing. “As for China’s role in the world economy, we continue to consult on collective approaches, also beyond the G7, to address the challenges posed by non-commercial policies and practices that deceive the world economy,” they said in their final statement after a summit where they denounced “non-transparent and deceive China market interventions.”"
23112	19	$14 billion against food insecurity
23112	21	"The seven G7 powers have urged countries and companies with ""important food stocks"" to help mitigate food shortage and commit to pay $4.5 billion extra to fight food insecurity."
23112	23	“As a short-term recourse, we ask partners with significant food stocks, as well as the private sector, to make food available without failing the markets, including by supporting the World Food Programme’s purchasing strategy,” the G7 said in a statement. The leaders of the G7 are also committed to paying additional $4.5 billion to fight food insecurity, raising the effort this year to approximately $14 billion, according to the statement.
23112	25	"The G7 also repeated its ""pressive call to Russia to put an unconditional end to the blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea, to the destruction of essential port and transport infrastructure, silos and grain terminals, to Russia's illegal procurement of agricultural products and equipment in Ukraine and to all other activities that hinder the production and export of Ukrainian food and exports."" “These actions can only be seen as a geopolitical-motivated attack on global food security,” the G7 says."
23112	27	The Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the blockade imposed on the ports of the Black Sea, has led to food prices to rise and has contributed to the global flame of inflation. Russia, on its part, denies that it has blocked the passage of charges and accuses Western sanctions of contributing to the food crisis.
23112	29	After the G7, several heads, including Emmanuel Macron, are expected in Madrid for a NATO summit, which will take place from 28 to 30 June.
23116	1	In France, guaranteeing the IVG without trembling
23116	3	“I don’t think the Supreme Court will come back on Roe v. Wade,” the progressive judge of the institution, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said in 2015. However, this was the case on Friday, when the federal law on abortion was buried by the same Supreme Court. It is always difficult to think of the worst, and that’s why democratic countries have a Constitution.
23116	5	On Saturday, LREM deputy leader Aurore Bergé, therefore, submitted a proposal of constitutional law to protect access to the IVG. Coming from the presidential party and immediately supported by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, this statement may make the teeth grin since LREM had refused in 2018 to enter this right when it was proposed by La France insoumise. Political action, but what does it matter? The main thing is to assemble the necessary majority in the two Chambers of Parliament before the opponents for women’s fundamental rights wake up.
23116	7	They never sleep, as their first reactions can be seen this weekend. “I’m not for,” said the president of the Modem, François Bayrou, on BFM TV, finding “surprising” that what is happening in the United States leads to “effervescent reactions in the French political life.” It was not yet her reaction in 1998 to the case Monica Lewinsky: “We say, ‘This is America!’ but no democracy is safe from it,” he warned then. Even the sound of the bell to the senator LR Bruno Retailleau, accusing the majority of inventing “fictive problems.” Relating to the conservatives, philosopher Alain Finkielkraut warned on Sunday on Europe 1 of an unexpected strengthening of women’s rights, because “the Constitution must be touched only with a trembling hand.” In 1992, Finkielkraut was part of a group that led a fierce battle to add to the Constitution an amendment against the French, without any of his hands trembling. It is now to the forces of social progress not to tremble.
23119	1	Ukraine: It’s no longer a war, it’s a massacre
23119	3	There will never be enough emphasis on the essential role of war photographers who only document the horror, and who have paid a heavy tribute to this conflict in Ukraine. On Sunday, their images turned around the media around the world, witnessing how Russian soldiers seem to have behaved in the liberated Ukrainian locations after several weeks of occupation. It is no longer a war, it is a massacre. Men executed hands in the back, women raped and then burned, bodies crashed by tanks... The list is long of the crimes that the Russians seem to have committed.
23119	5	Of course, we need to be cautious. Since the case of the true-false charniers of the Romanian city of Timisoara in 1989, it is known that we must be cautious of the emotions and images taken warmly. An investigation work will allow to determine the exact nature of the Russian crimes committed in Ukraine. And if it is proven that dozens, hundreds or even thousands of inhabitants of Ukrainian locations controlled by the Russian army have been executed with a shot in the neck or violated, it will not only be necessary to testify before international justice, but also to pass to the higher speed of sanctions.
23119	7	On Sunday, Western condemnations were almost unanimous, allowing to consider stronger economic repressions. Yes, it will demand sacrifices from our part, but do these images not make them inevitable? Though the story is filled with massacres, it is always difficult to understand how men can get rid of such angry beasts over those who, the previous day, were considered brothers or cousins. Vladimir Putin carries a crushing responsibility in this situation, he who has heated, manipulated and then released his men on Ukraine but also all those around him who know the extent of disinformation and keep silence from fear of repressions. They must know that they will pay the price one day.
2312	1	Climate, the great global manipulation: The Twelve lies of the GIEC and the “ecologist religion”
2312	3	The COP 26 did not end in Glasgow as planned. His president, Alok Sharma, said that “the coal must be stored in history books” and said that “the coal must be stopped and any subsidy to fossil energies must be stopped.”
2312	5	Everything seemed to be resolved for a vote without history, when on Saturday, November 13, an hour before the closing of the conference, an unprecedented event occurred. The representative of India, his environment minister Bhupender Yadav, said that his country did not accept the scheduled edition and proposed another such stated: “We need to go towards clean technologies, including by increasing efforts to gradually reduce coal energy and gradually eliminate ineffective subsidies to fossil fuels...”. The Indian Minister claimed in the aftermath that China supported India’s proposal. The official projections of these countries show that the global CO emissions will surprisingly continue to grow.
2312	6	Should we be afraid of the disaster? Not to. There was 4 times more CO in the atmosphere at the time of the dinosaurs and everything went well. Sinous we are afraid because we are afraid because fear is false judgment. And those who have a negative vision of mankind, who have dominated the United Nations for half a century, know it well. November 2018. So suddenly as unprecedented, the Yellow Gilets rebellion shook France. The reason for anger? Increased increase in fuel prices. In the name of the fight against excess CO emissions and a hypothetical ecological transition, Emmanuel Macron’s government, according to the United Nations and the IEC’s recommendations, persists to make carbon gas the cause of global warming that can justify any hardening of taxation. Christian Gerondeau’s work, however, shows that our national emissions do not weigh anything with regard to the mass of CO present in the atmosphere. And if all developed countries completely eliminate their emissions by the middle of the century, the impact on CO concentration in the atmosphere would not exceed 2 to 3%. The yellow gloves were therefore right: the ecological transition can only be a pretext so its foundations do not resist the examination. Can therefore the growing human needs of oil, gas, and coal be seen as a catastrophe for the climate? The latest satellite reports do not go in that direction. Certainly, in 2015 and early 2016, a temperature rise brought records, but it lasted little. The official reports that this book reproduces are unanimous: things have returned to normal in the middle of 2016. Furthermore, many leading scientists, in France and elsewhere, are going to say that there is not only no reason to fear CO emissions but that we must, on the contrary, rejoice! So it is time to dare the taboo question: CO, disaster or benefit?
23127	1	Poland to build a wall at the border with Belarus to reject migrants from the Middle East and Africa
23127	3	Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and a delegation of security officials visited their country’s border on Thursday to mark the completion of a 300 km steel wall along the border with Belarus.
23127	5	In his remarks to journalists, Mr. Morawiecki used artifacts to distract liberal attention from Poland’s selective approach to immigration, which welcomes the Ukrainians while rejecting the Syrians:
23127	7	“The first sign of the war in Ukraine was the attack of (the President of Belarus) Alexander Lukashenko on the Polish border with Belarus. It is thanks to our political clarity and anticipation of what could happen that we can now focus on helping Ukraine, which is struggling to protect its sovereignty,” he told reporters.
23127	9	Belarus supported Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, in particular by allowing Russian forces to use the territory of Belarus.
23127	11	The “attack” of Lukaschenko on Poland took the form of a militarized migration, its government encouraging Migrants from the Middle East to come to Belarus and then try to enter the European Union through the country’s borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. This initiative was perceived as a new form of rejection of EU sanctions against Belarus due to its treatment of dissidents.
23127	13	Thousands of migrants from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Africa fled to Belarus and headed to the Polish border, where they suffered a cold in their search for crossing the border. Sometimes the situation has led to major confrontations. In November, hundreds of migrants pushed to the border near the Polish village of Kuznica and tried to dismantle a barbed wire ceiling with pells and other tools.
23127	15	“This is part of the inhuman approach of the Lukaschenko regime, which consists in lying to people, abusing them (...) and making them come to Belarus by making them mirror a easy entry into the European Union,” a spokesman said at the time.
23127	17	Human rights groups have accused the two countries of abusing migrants. According to the Associated Press, at least 20 people were killed in the “Ice forests and turbines” of the border zone.
23127	19	At the same time as the closing of the wall, the Polish government issued an emergency statement that prohibited journalists and human rights activists from observing the situation along the border.
23127	21	Activists have criticized the Polish government for having simultaneously welcomed Ukrainian refugees, mostly white, Christian and female, while refusing male migrants, mostly Muslims, from other countries.
23127	23	“If you give an elevator to a refugee at the Ukrainian border, you are a hero. If you do it at the border with Belarus, you are a trader and you can end in prison for eight years,” said Natalia Gebert, founder of a Polish non-governmental organization that helps refugees.
23127	25	Meanwhile, in another sign of tension between Warsaw and Minsk, the Polish government accused Thursday Belarus of favouring a “atmosphere of acquisition” to vandalism against Polish tombs, Reuters reports:
23127	27	The Polish Foreign Ministry said unknown people had recently damaged Polish tomb stones and memorial monuments in several places, mainly in western Belarus, which was part of Poland before World War II and where many Polish soldiers are buried.
23127	29	The Ukrainian immigration wave is devastating the EU, as the unemployment figures in Germany show Thursday. Analysts predicted that the number of unemployed would decrease by 5,000, but it rose by 133,000.
23127	31	“These increases are due to the fact that Ukrainian refugees are now registered in employment agencies and are therefore visible in labour market statistics,” said Detlef Scheele, director of the Federal Labour Agency.
23131	1	Macron is funded by Algeria.
23131	3	Some are often harassed or even overwhelmed by the anti-French statements and Macron’s induced tribute to Algeria, his history... such as Benjamin Stora’s unacceptable work, being just a charge against France.
23131	5	In fact, it is not ideology. It would simply be repeated thanks to the Algeria regime for funding its first campaign, probably in cash... We are talking about 18 million euros... The oligarchs surrounding Bouteflika are now in prison, but the Minister of Foreign Affairs survives, who, like Le Drian, has passed from one president to another... Ramtane Lamara never fails to fustige Macron when he begins to disobey and Foutriquet to ask for forgiveness...
23131	7	So in February 2017, in full presidential campaign, Emmanuel Macron visits Algeria. But instead of meeting representatives of civil society, he only sees officials and, more discreetly, affairists close to power and calls the French colonization a crime against humanity... So he will constantly support the regime, even at the strongest of the “Hirak”, when thirteen million Algerians marched throughout Algeria against a fifth term of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Had Emmanuel Macron offered his protection to a corrupt and discredited military regime, in exchange for financial support?
23131	9	This documentary, episode 6 of the series “Emmanuel Macron, a businessman at the Elysée” of Off Investigation, a new media from the left, does not give any gift to Foutriquet and puts in perspective numerous revelations, with guest star Alexandre Benalla.

23135	1	The UN keeps its LGBTQI+ rights defender despite the hostility of Muslim countries
23135	3	The mission of the LGBTQI+ minority rights defender to the United Nations was contested by the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which defends the interests of Muslim countries in the United Nations.
23135	5	"""A significant outcome,"" he congratulated with AFP Victor Madrigal-Borloz, who has been in charge since 2017. The LGBTQI+ minority rights defendant at the United Nations has rightly obtained the renewal of his mandate, despite the harsh struggle of a group of Muslim countries in all United Nations arenas. Its mission, established in 2016, was renewed last week in Geneva by the Human Rights Council, for three additional years."

23135	9	"The protection of the rights of sexual and gender minorities is regularly debated in the UN, due to the sharp opposition of some countries that question the existence of concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, pointed out as contrary to their traditional values and as an obstacle to the universality of human rights. Despite a campaign involving “more than 1,100 LGBTQI+ organizations” from 174 countries and “political support” from dozens of states, according to the rights defender, the renewal of the post had to face the hostility of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which defends the interests of Muslim countries in the UN. A group of African and Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Egypt, in particular refused the use of the terms ""sexual orientation"", ""transgender"" and ""men having sex with men"". ""We can't support efforts to invent new rights based on personal sexual preferences,"" Pakistani ambassador Khalil Hashmi told the Human Rights Council on behalf of 56 states who, except for Albania, are all members of the OECD."
23135	11	“The pretext of specific values”
23135	13	French Ambassador Jérôme Bonnafont said: “Many countries are hiding behind the pretext of specific values to preserve discriminatory legislation.” With 23 votes against 17 – Malawi, Eritrea and China joining 14 Muslim countries – the Council finally acted the renewal, after rejecting several amendments aimed at limiting its scope, sometimes with a single vote of deviation. “The international community continues to understand the extent of violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or different gender persons,” said Victor Madrigal-Borloz, fustiging “a very regrettable political positioning” of the countries opposed to his mission: “The speech of these states (...) constitutes a rejection of their fundamental obligations in the field of international human rights: the protection of peoples under their authority, and of their own nationals, against human rights violations.”

23135	19	"Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt, whose country recalls the attack that killed two people and injured 21 near a gay bar in Oslo on June 25, greeted on Twitter ""the decision of the Human Rights Council to renew (this) important mandate."" U.S. Ambassador Michèle Taylor, whose two children identify themselves as LGBTQI+ persons, expressed her relief: “I worry every day about their safety. But I sleep better at night knowing that there is a mandate in place dedicated to protecting them from violence.”"

23138	1	The US state is destroying on July 4th.
23138	3	by Dan Sanchez.
23138	5	It seems that the U.S. economy in trouble will put a barrier to the 4th July celebrations this year.
23138	7	The Wall Street Journal on Thursday:
23138	9	“In all of America, the fireworks of 4 July will not be shot on 4 July. »
23138	11	Some cities and municipalities reprogram their pyrotechnic shows of the Independence Day due to a lack of fireworks or workers.
23138	13	And as many media reveal, the meals will be much more expensive than last year. The Washington Examiner reports:
23138	15	“The cost of a 4th July barbecue is expected to be 17 percent higher than last year, according to a consumer basket survey conducted by the American Farm Bureau Federation. This is a figure that exceeds the overall inflation, as prices are on average 8.6% higher than a year ago, according to the consumer price index. This also represents a major turning towards the small economies for the celebration that the White House of Biden shamefully praised in 2021 – attracting the commentators’ joke. »
23138	17	It will be harder to celebrate America’s birthday when the American dream will be on the hard wire. But it will be a good time to think about how we were in this difficult situation.
23138	19	July 4 is the Independence Day of America. It marks our separation from the British Empire: a state that, through a “long sequence of abuses and usurpations” (according to the terms of our Declaration of Independence), has shown itself to be destructive of the individual rights of the Americans. According to the classical liberal credo of the founders of America, it was unacceptable, because the only legitimate purpose of a state is to protect the individual rights of the administrators.
23138	21	Today, the U.S. state violates the rights of the Americans to a point that former British leaders appear compassionate in comparison. Especially since the rise of the Covid-19, the attacks due to the state against freedom and property have turned into a total war against production and therefore against our means of survival.
23138	23	They blocked huge panels of the economy and locked millions of families in their homes.
23138	25	A massive expansion of public spending has made a large part of the country’s wealth pass from private control to public control.
23138	27	The Federal Reserve led a war against savings and healthy investments, and therefore a war against sustainable capital formation.
23138	29	The Biden administration has discouraged the work with recovery expenses and strangled energy production with regulations.
23138	31	And by using the money of our taxes to lead the whole Western world into a world economic war with Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government has worsened a terrible and sustainable situation: it has caused the collapse of food and energy trade.
23138	33	As Elon Musk warned in 2020, “If you don’t make anything, there’s nothing.” If you prohibit entrepreneurs from opening shops and workers from going to work, there will be fewer goods. If you prohibit national industries from importing food and fuel, there will be fewer food and fuel. If you don’t have enough energy to produce consumption goods, there will be fewer consumption goods. and c.
23138	35	No recovery measure funded by the monetary creation of the Federal Reserve will change this. An electric shock will not make a prisoner work harder if he is handed. You can’t even stimulate an economy bound to prosperity.
23138	37	Now, as an inevitable result, there are much more Federal Reserve bills for much less goods than would have been otherwise. That is why prices are rising.
23138	39	But they are probably not increasing as much as they should to fully reflect the greatest rarity, due to the permanent threat of repression against abusive prices (as economist Walter Block recently supported here on FEE.org). And this is one of the main reasons why there are chronic and generalized deficiencies.
23138	41	The Americans have betrayed the heritage of our founding fathers by abandoning the rights for which they have fought to a much worse tyrannia than that they have overthrowed, for the false promise of abundance, security and health provided by the state. Therefore, on this Independence Day, they have less freedom to celebrate and therefore less goods and services to do so.
23138	43	To truly honour the foundation of America, Americans should begin to act as Americans, declare their independence as individuals and demand their freedom to cooperate with each other to produce, supply and prosper.
23146	1	Johnson warns Macron not to try a settlement in Ukraine now
23146	3	LONDON – Trying to resolve the conflict in Ukraine now would only cause “a sustainable instability,” Boris Johnson warned Emmanuel Macron on Sunday.
23146	5	Speaking at the G7 world leaders’ summit in Germany, the British Prime Minister told the French president that such a decision “will give Putin the permission to permanently manipulate the sovereign countries and international markets,” according to a Downing Street reading of the couple’s meeting. and
23146	7	Before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Macron was one of the few Western leaders whoined dialogue with Vladimir Putin and regularly talked with the Russian president since the beginning of the conflict.
23146	9	Macron also warned that Russia should not be “humiliated” by Putin’s “historical and fundamental mistake.”
23146	11	A spokesman for Downing Street said Johnson and Macron agreed that it was now a “critical moment for the conflict” and that there was “a chance to break the course of the war.”
23146	13	But Johnson’s office added: “The Prime Minister stressed that any attempt to resolve the conflict now would only cause sustainable instability and give Putin permission to permanently manipulate sovereign countries and international markets. »
23146	15	The comments of the British leader came after he warned the G7 and NATO allies not to encourage Ukraine to satisfy with a “bad peace” as Russia’s war ends.
23148	1	Italy says support from Ukraine is inappropriate
23148	3	It is necessary to negotiate Ukraine with Russia before the West becomes worse.
23148	5	Western countries must stop supporting the losing Ukraine and put it on the table of negotiations with Russia, in order to avoid the most serious consequences of the confrontation with Russia, writes the chronicler of the Italian publication Giornale Gian Mikalessin.
23148	7	"The chronicle claims that NATO countries have doubled that they should support Ukraine ""as much as necessary"" after the occupation of Lisichansk by the allied forces of the Russian Federation and the RPL. Mikalessin believes that Ukrainian armed forces cannot be compared to Russian troops. He also called the illusion that Western weapons in the hands of Ukraine can affect the outcome of the special operation. He reminded the technical complexity of NATO weapons, which the Ukrainians are unable to serve."
23148	9	At the same time, the journalist has not forgotten the risk of an unprecedented rise in energy prices, which the West so needs. So, according to JP Morgan’s forecasts, in autumn the price of the oil barrel could reach $380. At the same time, disagreements are inevitable within the NATO on the perspective of a conflict with Russia: at least the Germans, the French and the Italians will not want to make sacrifices for Ukraine condemned to defeat.
23148	11	How can Ukraine enter NATO?
23148	13	“Therefore, many people—from the White House to the Palace of Elysée to the Federal Chancellor’s office in Berlin—will ask themselves: is it better to negotiate now? “The author concluded.
23152	1	Joe Biden and the Saudi Despot: a very revealing submission
23152	3	Joe Biden’s immediate abandonment of his 2020 wish to make the Saudis “paria”, and his growing support for the regime, show the fundamental misconduct of American propaganda.
23152	5	Translated by the readers of the site
23152	7	In 2018, President Trump published a statement reaffirming the U.S.’s long-standing relationship with the Saudi royal family, on the grounds that this partnership serves the “national interests” of America. Trump specifically quoted the fact that “Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producer nation in the world” and that it has bought hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons from U.S. weapons manufacturers. Trump's statement was published as a result of numerous requests to Washington that Trump should reduce or even break his ties with the Saudi regime due to the likely role played by his heir Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in the brutal murder of the Washington Post chronicler, Jamal Khashoggi.
23152	9	What made these demands of the Trump era somewhat strange is that Khashoggi’s murder was not exactly the first time the Saudi regime violated human rights and committed atrocities of almost all kinds. For decades, arbitrary imprisonment and murder of dissidents, journalists and Saudi activists have been a common currency, not to mention the devastation of Yemen supported by the United States and the United Kingdom that began during the Obama years. All this happened when the U.S. presidents of the post-World War II made the deep and close partnership between Washington and the Riyadh tyrants a fundamental element of U.S. policy in the Middle East.
23152	11	However, as it was typical for Trump’s years, political and media commentators treated Trump’s decision to maintain relations with the Saudis as if it was an unprecedented aberration of the evil of which he was the only pioneer – a radical deviation from the long-standing bipartisan American values – rather than what it was: namely, the continuation of the standard bipartisan American policy for decades. In an indignated editorial following Trump’s statement, the New York Times said that Trump would make the world “more [dangerous] by hardening the despotics in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere,” specifically blaming “Trump’s opinion that all relations are transactional and that moral or human rights considerations must be sacrificed to a basic understanding of American national interests. »
23152	13	The Eurocrat, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, regretted what he described as Trump’s vision of the world: “If you buy U.S. weapons and if you are against Iran – then you can kill and repress as much as you want. CNN published an analysis of Stephen Collinson, the chain reporter to the White House, under the title: “Trump’s Saudi support highlights the brutality of America First doctrine” – which tweeted: “When he refused to break with the strong Saudi man Mohammed bin Salman about the killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Trump actually told the world despot that if they stand on his side, Washington will close his eyes on actions that violate the traditional values of the United States. “Trump’s will to do business with the Saudis,” Collinson said, “was another blow to the state of international law and global responsibility, concepts that Trump has shown little desire to be respected in two years of office. »
23152	15	The Democratic presidential candidates at that time, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, were the most virulent to criticize Trump’s constant will to maintain ties with the Saudi regime. “In the years before their entry into office, President Joe Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and many senior officials of their administration have severely criticized the absence of President Donald Trump’s action against Saudi Arabia and hered Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder in 2018 of Saudi journalist and Washington Post chronicler Jamal Khashoggi. »
23152	17	During a 2019 Democratic primary debate, Biden swore: “We would actually make them pay the price, and make them actually the parias they are” (sic), adding that there is “very little value of social redemption in the current government in Saudi Arabia. Harris also appelled Trump for his continued relationship with the Saudis, complaining on Twitter in October 2019 that “Trump has not yet held Saudi official representatives responsible,” adding: “Inacceptable: America must make clear that violence against critics and the press will not be tolerated. »
23152	19	The fact that Joe Biden becomes a kind of human rights cross that would cut off the links with the despotic regimes that have long been among America’s most expensive partners was intrinsically grotesque. As Obama’s vice president, Biden played a central role in the foreign policy of this administration, which kissed the world’s most barbaric tyrants. Obama was so devoted to the U.S.’s long-standing partnership with Riyadh that in 2015, he deeply offended India – the world’s largest democracy – by suddenly interrupting his visit to Saudi Arabia, along with leaders of the two U.S. political parties, in order to tribute to Saudi King Abdullah’s death. To add insult to the injury, Obama, as the Guardian said, embarked on his plane to Riyadh “just a few hours after having held a conference in India on religious tolerance and women’s rights. »
23152	21	The indefectible support of the White House under Obama/Biden to the Saudi regime has not been limited to obsessive gestures like these. Their dedication to the strengthening of the Saudi despotic ruling family was much more important – and deadly. Obama’s administration has played a key role in promoting the Saudi attack on Yemen, which has led to the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. In order to calm the Saudis about its agreement with Iran, “Obama administration has offered Saudi Arabia more than $115 billion in weapons, other military equipment and training, the highest amount of any U.S. administration in the U.S.-Saudi alliance for 71 years,” Reuters in late 2016, a few months before Obama and Biden leave their duties.
23152	23	Beyond the huge stock of sophisticated weapons that Obama/Biden transferred to the Saudis to use them against Yemen and against all those they decided to target, Snowden’s archives revealed that Obama ordered a significant increase in the amount and type of intelligence technology as well as the raw intelligence provided by the NSA to the Saudi regime. This information was – and is still – used by the Saudi autocrates not only to identify the targets of the bombings in Yemen, but also to subject their own population to a close, practically everlasting surveillance: a control regime used to brutally suppress any dissidence or opposition to the Saudi regime.
23152	25	In sum, it is not exaggerated to see that the White House under Obama/Biden – as well as their subalterne British counterparts – were responsible for the Saudi regime’s ability to survive and conduct this devastating war in Yemen. But it is not new. The main part of the U.S. policy in the Middle East for decades has been to support the Saudi despot with weapons and diplomatic protection in exchange for the fact that the Saudis serve the U.S. interests with their oil supply and guarantee the use of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency on the oil market.
23152	27	That’s what made the hysteric reaction to Trump’s reaffirmation of this relationship so absurd and deliberately misleading. Trump didn’t wildly get away from the US policy by kissing the Saudi tyrants, but he simply pursued the long-term US policy consisting of supporting all kinds of wild despotics around the world every time it pushed the American interests forward. The U.S. presidents are not supposed to explicitly admit that they neglect the human rights violations of their allies because of the benefits that this relationship provides them, even though this amoral and interested approach has been and has been for decades one of the ideological premises of bipartisan U.S. foreign policy.
23152	29	Beyond the Saudi example, the same thing was seen when Trump welcomed the brutal Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the White House; the dominant commentary saw there a sort of shocking violation of the fundamental American principles.
23152	31	In fact, the United States has been the greatest benefactor of Egyptian tyrannia for decades. They armed and supported the Mubarak regime until it was overthrown. Obama's Secretary of State, John Kerry, praised the military coup orchestrated by General Sisi against the country's first democratically elected leader, as a attempt to protect democracy. And shortly before the beginning of the Arab Spring, Hillary Clinton, who succeeded Kerry, declared her personal affection to the predecessor of Sisi, the monstrous dictator who led Egypt for three decades: “I really consider President and Mrs. Mubarak as friends of my family, and therefore I hope to see him often here in Egypt and the United States,” she wrote in 2009, while Obama was making sure that the flow of money and weapons to Mubarak never ceases.
23152	33	While the bipartisan political and media class has spent decades insisting, and continues to insist on the fact that the main objective of the U.S. foreign policy is to defend freedom and democracy and fight the tyrannia in the world, the undisputed reality is exactly the opposite: supporting the world’s most brutal dictators who serve the interests of the U.S. is an essential element of U.S. foreign policy since at least the end of World War II. What determines the U.S. support or opposition to a foreign country is not whether it is democratic or despotic, but whether it is deferent.
23152	35	Thus, it is not Trump’s adherence to long-standing U.S. partnerships with Saudi and Egyptian despotics that has represented a radical gap from U.S. tradition. The radical gap was Biden’s promise during the 2020 presidential campaign to make the Saudis “paria” and to isolate them to punish them from their atrocities. But few people in Washington were alarmed by Biden’s campaign desire because no one believed Joe Biden had ever intended to do so.
23152	37	That’s why it’s absolutely not surprising, as disgusting it may seem, that Joe Biden has quickly abandoned this foreign policy desire of the 2020 campaign on Saudi Arabia at the first occasion. Far from making Saudi Arabia a “paria” state as he had promised, Joe Biden has perfectly pursued – and even intensified – the American tradition consisting of supporting and strengthening what is very likely the most despotic and murderous regime in the world.
23152	39	"Just a month after Biden's infiltration, the director of the National Intelligence released a long-secret report that announced: ""We believe that Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman has approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill"" Jamal Khashoggi. However, the White House, while imposing some mild sanctions on some Saudi individuals, categorically refused to impose penalties on the inheritance prince Ben Salman himself."
23152	41	But this was just the beginning of Biden’s support for the Saudi regime. In November, “the U.S. State Department approved its first major weapons sale to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under the presidency of Joe Biden, with the sale of 280 air-air missiles of a maximum value of $650 million.” A few weeks later, the U.S. Senate, reports Politico, “admitted a bilateral vote of confidence to the proposal to sell weapons from the Biden administration to Saudi Arabia, exciting the criticism of progressists and some Republicans about the kingdom’s involvement in the civil war in Yemen and its human rights balance.” A group of dissidents – led by Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) – claimed that weapons sales would fuel war in Yemen and harden the Saudi regime, but they were easily scattered by a bipartisan majority protecting the status quo and led by the leaders of both parties, Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
23152	43	"And now it seems that Biden is considering a pilgrimage in Riyadh to visit his Saudi partners personally. Last week, the New York Times that Biden ""has decided to go to Riyadh this month to reconstruct relations with the oil-rich kingdom, at a time when he seeks to lower gas prices in his country and to isolate Russia abroad."" During this trip, “the president will meet” Ben Salman himself, who, according to his own director of Biden’s National Intelligence, supervised Khashoggi’s murder. The justification offered by the New York Times for Biden’s scheduled trip was practically identical to the arguments used by Trump in 2018: “The visit represents the triumph of realpolitik over moral anger, according to foreign policy experts. »"
23152	45	Indeed, the explanation offered by the Secretary of State of Biden for the President’s ongoing agreement with the Saudis is practically indiscernable from the justification offered by Trump that has raised so much anger over the fall of American ideals allegedly caused by his will to do business with non-democratic regimes:
23152	47	“Saudi Arabia is an essential partner for us in the fight against extremism in the region, in the management of the challenges posed by Iran, and also, I hope it, in the continuation of the process of building relations between Israel and its close and distant neighbors through the pursuit, the expansion of the Abraham agreements,” said Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Wednesday at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the magazine Foreign Affairs. He added that human rights are always important, but “we address all our interests in this relationship. »
23152	49	Although from the beginning Biden has clearly abandoned his campaign promise – keeping the United States away from the Saudis – he justifies this move by the need to claim to the Saudis to put more oil available on the market in order to compensate for the sanctions imposed by the United States on Russia. As the Times says: “Russia and Saudi Arabia are almost equally as the world’s second-largest oil producer, which means that when Biden administration officials tried to cut food to one, they concluded that they couldn’t afford to disagree with the other. “After the Times report, Biden officials said the trip had been postponed in July, but they didn’t deny that it would take place.
23152	51	What a convincing moral argument can we advance to say it is better to buy Saudi oil in order to avoid buying Russian oil? No matter the opinion of everyone about the extent of autocracy under Putin's rule in Russia, there is no minimal credible argument to say that it is worse than the systemic tyrannia imposed for a long time by the ruling Saudi family. In fact, it is practically impossible to conteste that, at least before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, civil freedoms were more in Russia than in Saudi Arabia. And if one can assuredly claim that the three-month war conducted by Russia in Ukraine was a moral atrocity, there is no basis – no basis – to claim that it is worse, at any level, than the blind violence and destruction that the Saudis have dissolved in Yemen for seven years (unless more value is given to the lives of European Ukrainians than to those of non-European Yemenians).
23152	53	And even if we were insisting on the fact that absolutely nothing on the planet is worse than the Russian invasion of Ukraine and that therefore everything must be done to maintain the sanctions regime imposed on Russia, how would this doubtful moral claim justify closing the eyes on Saudi atrocities and sending Biden, on his knees, to ask Ben Salman for more oil? If drowning and punishing Russia is the highest moral and strategic priority, why’t it be more cautious and more moral for the United States to lift the restrictions imposed by Biden on its own national fores as a means of replacing Russian oil, especially if it enables to avoid further strengthening the Saudi regime?
23152	55	But the only and only value of the US partnership with Saudi Arabia is to reveal the truth to us. Of course, the U.S. foreign policy is not dedicated to the spread of freedom and democracy, and to the fight against despotism and tyrannia in the world. How can a country that has the Saudi monarchs, the Egyptian military junte, the Qatar slaveryists and the Emirates dictators among its closest partners and allies claim without hesitation that it opens tyrannia and is fighting war to protect democracy? The United States is not concerned at all about whether a foreign country is governed by democracy or tyrannia. They worry about one and only one question: does the government of this country serve or hinder the American interests?
23154	1	Borrel: G20 countries do not share the EU and G7 position on the Ukrainian issue
23154	3	Josep Borrel said on his own blog that the G20 countries condemned the Russian special military operation, but that they refused more radical measures and statements due to the desire to maintain their relations with Russia.
23154	5	European diplomacy chief Josep Borrel, after the G20 ministerial summit, wrote on his own blog that the position of the states of the European Union and the G7, expressed in the condemnation of Russia for actions in Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions, remains unchanged. However, among the G20 members, this position does not prevail.
23154	7	“In principle, everyone condemns the violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. But when it comes to naming the aggressor and indicating who is responsible for the consequences, many abstain for various reasons,” Borrel said.
23154	9	According to him, for many countries, the economic consequences of the crisis in Ukraine have proved to be more important than the issues of responsibility for it. Borel emphasized that in this situation, many want to maintain good relations with Russia and do not take anyone side.Russia temporarily shut down the main gas pipeline to Europe
23157	1	Computer pirate RaHDIt accuses U.S. of delivering satellite images to Kiev to bomb Russia
23157	3	U.S. intelligence services provide Kiev with radar data, as well as satellite images, including the territory of Russia, said a member of the Russian hacking group RaHDIt under anonymity cover.
23157	5	“We know reliably that U.S. intelligence services provide Ukrainian intelligence services with satellite images, radar data, including satellite images of the Russian territory, where, in fact, Ukrainian missiles and missiles arrive. The fact that their radar detection systems work in the interests of Ukrainian intelligence services, we see it as well,” he said in an interview with RIA Novosti.
23157	7	The agency spokesman said that for such attacks it is necessary to have accurate information, as well as to know the location of the targets.
23157	9	Earlier this day, it was that the Russian pirate group RaHDit and the Ukrainian “Beregini” obtained secret operational documents from the Ukrainian army.
23157	11	According to one of the RaHDit participants, the Beregini group helps hackers get information in real time. He explained that the group is helped by their friends who serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU).
23157	13	Furthermore, one of the computer hackers of the RaHDit group said that the losses of Ukrainian armed forces today are at least 50 to 70,000 killed.
23157	15	Before that, on July 8, it was that the RaHDit pirate group had distributed new data on the employees of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GID) of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, as well as on the people involved. The documents contain information about 2,500 people. This is mainly information on the criminal history of the DIU agents, among which are persons found guilty of qualified theft, illegal trafficking in weapons and drugs, serious body injuries and rape.
23157	17	At the same time, hackers released on July 6 the first part of the data collected. To access the data, the RaHDit group used faults in the GUR network protection, as well as big data analysis methods from user behavior characteristic patterns.
23157	19	On June 8, the computer pirate RaHDIt said that disagreements had begun to arise between the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the command of the Ukrainian armed forces on the conduct of hostilities. According to him, for this reason, the Ukrainian army suffered severe losses.
23157	21	The question is not whether this information is true or not – and it is undoubtedly true – but to note that Russia agrees to disclose such information that practically forces it in the eyes of everyone to shut down U.S. observation satellites, as it once had shut down a U2 that flows over its territory.
23160	1	Ukraine declares war to opposition: a certain vision of “democracy”
23160	3	According to Karine Bechet-Golovko, a doctor in public law, the “globalist” camp cannot afford to support Ukraine in the name of democracy and the rule of law, given the treatment reserved by Kiev to the opposition. Democracy in Ukraine is the slogan behind which the civilization war led by the global world in Ukraine against Russia is hidden. The speech affirms that post-Maidan Ukraine is democratic, of course imperfect, but has made the choice of democracy. This is not discussed, it is supported. The world supports Ukraine. As we can read in Le Monde late March of this year: “While it is imperfect and foolish, Ukrainian democracy exists, and it constitutes a precious weakness in the post-Soviet space of Eastern Europe.”  Democracy in Ukraine is the slogan behind which the civilization war led by the global world in Ukraine against Russia and the institutions of the global world all support this democratic path. The NATO stated, a decade ago, that “a sovereign, independent and stable Ukraine, strongly attached to democracy and the rule of law, is indispensable to the euro-Atlantic security.” As for the Council of Europe, it works with the Ukrainian Ministry of Communities and Territorial Development, so that the European principles dominate the Ukrainian territorial organization – in any case, as we learned in early June: “Since the beginning of the war, the Expertise Centre for Good Governance has provided assistance to Ukrainian national and local authorities, [...] with the aim of raising awareness of the main challenges that Ukrainian regions and municipalities are facing and facilitating a trade with their peers from other European countries.”
23160	5	If this globalist media-institutional packaging for the “Ukrainian democracy” primarily serves to justify the unconditional support that the global world demands to Ukraine, what is it in the country’s political and legal reality of this famous “Post-Maidan democracy”? The stability and sincerity of a democratic system is measured by the respect it gives to the opposition. No democratic system is perfect, but when there is a rotation of political forces, that a majority knows that it will inevitably soon or later find itself in the opposition, it has all interest in granting rights to that opposition, in order to be able to return to power in the future. In general, the quality of governance of a country depends greatly on the quality of its opposition, because it obliges the majority to improve, at least by interest, in order not to lose power, unless by conviction. But while the arcanes of the global world congratulate, tapping on their shoulders, glossing of “Ukrainian democracy”, that same post-Maidan Ukraine has literally declared war to its opposition. Without a legal basis then, the National Security and Defence Council declares on 18 March 2022 the suspension of the time of the military operation of nothing less than 11 political parties of opposition. The legal basis was later established, from May 3, when the Ukrainian Parliament, the Rada, amends certain legislative provisions in force by extending the foundations under which it is possible to prohibit the constitution and activity of a political party, in particular to “the justification or denial of Russian aggression, or its presentation as an internal conflict”. On May 14, President Zelensky signed the law on the liquidation of the pro-Russian parties. Thus, the decision of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine can be legitimated before justice, perfectly submitted, since it has already been the subject of a drastic cleansing after Maidan. The court ball of the Lvov Court of Appeal (in Western Ukraine, just) was opened on June 8, with the prohibition of the party “Block of Opposition”. Then, on June 13, the court banned two parties, the “Socialists” and “Justice and Development”. They are all small parties, less active and less representative. But the beautiful “Ukrainian democracy” has passed at a higher speed and on June 16 it banned the party of the opponent and iconic blogger Sharii. On 20 June, serious things begin with the ban of the first parliamentary party, “Platform of Opposition – For Life”. Some are still waiting for prohibition, but questions are already being asked. Ukrainian globalist media, like Unian, are concerned: what do voters from these banned parties do? For they risk not only to be able to reorganize a later opposition party, but they continue to exercise their parliamentary mandate... What is obviously a shame in post-Majdan Democratic Ukraine, than to let elected opposition parliamentarians fully exercise their mandate... The irony is pushed to its maximum. These prohibited parties can appeal to the Supreme Court of Ukraine. But what are the real chances of an objective review of their situation, when we know that the repressive machine is packaging and goes further, with a draft law requiring the ban for members of these parties to be eligible for any electoral function, of any level? Not to stop in such a good way, a draft law is in discussion, bringing amendments to the art. 51 of the Internal Rules of the Council, in order to limit the constitutional rights of opposition members, by blocking their access to committees and committees of work and investigation. Ukrainian globalists hide themselves and justify themselves by the “war”, not able to recognize the totalitarian nature of their approach. It is, for example, possible to read this: “The situation in which the former representatives of the recognized pro-Russian political forces in the framework of the war with Russia continue to exercise the powers of the Ukrainian people’s MPs is not only absurd, but also a potential threat to the security of the state.” But, in the same article, a few phrases above, it is precised that the need to ban the so-called “pro-Russian” political parties existed before February 24. The argument of war is a excuse, not a reason. The problem is much more general: since the 2014 Maidan, the Ukrainian system can no longer afford political pluralism, that political pluralism that after the first outer force blow of the 2004 Orange Revolution allowed the return to a peaceful internal policy towards Russia and thus reduced all those international efforts of 2004. The lessons have been taken, the errors have not been repeated, the “post-Maidan democracy” can be only one block, leaving room for the alternative. Nevertheless, this poses real legal problems, and the international community knowing it, praisefully keeps silence on these liberticidal derivatives, in order to protect the speech of a “democratic” Ukraine. Because by closing parliamentary political parties, Ukraine directly violates the regular functioning of the institutions and the regularity of the legislative texts adopted. Ukraine cannot at the same time be in war, and therefore be able to justify all infringements to the regular functioning of institutions, and be democratic and respecting the rule of law. But the global world cannot afford to officially support in the name of democracy and the rule of law, a country that openly infringes and democracy and the rule of law.
23161	1	Europe: Who has an escape plan? What is he?
23161	3	This is a disappointment in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Let’s take a look at this little-interested choreography. Ursula von der Leyen, who chairs the European Commission, wants the rule of unanimousness to be ceased in some key areas where it is still required, and therefore the treaties should be amended. The areas where this unanimousness is still required are diplomacy and defence; legal and political cooperation; taxation; expansion to other countries; budget; social harmony; citizenship and treaties change. This is to make Europe more efficient and independent. Emmanuel Macron is for this and intends to dedicate a summit of the Council of Europe to this issue by the end of June[2]. Fortunately, some countries have revealed their hostility to this idea.
23161	5	We had already had the mandatory vaccination mentioned by this unelected president, and her untemporary interventions on the Ukrainian conflict. There we have the confession: the European technocratic structure wants to rule alone, in dishonor of the sovereignty of the nations that form Europe and of subsidiarity.
23161	7	Born from a French father and a German mother who met after the war, having worn the European Scouts uniform and having studied at the European Business School, I should logically join the European project. I cannot. I can no longer.
23161	9	The European Union has ceased to be democratic, and for a long time. The European currency was conceived as being unable to deviate from a liberal monetary policy based on a doxa that makes inflation the irreversible sin. That this choice cannot be questioned by citizens is non-democratic. In 2008, there was the Lisbon Treaty that followed the rejection by referendum of the 2005 European Constitutional Treaty. Nicolas Sarkozy, his ministers and parliamentarians who participated in this abomination should be prosecuted for this high betrayal.
23161	11	Is it the European Union that imposes us to France not be democratic either? The eviction of François Asselineau, the only Frexit candidate slightly serious in the last presidential election allows to assume that.
23161	13	The European Union has become a convenient structure for mutualization of lobbies. This proves, for example, the opacity of the commission that caviars to make them unreadable the contracts for the provision of vaccines concluded by an executive in conflict of interest. As by chance, it is the American-inspired lobby that successfully promotes the interests of their mandates.
23161	15	From now on, the European Union is aligned without any retreat on the aggressive and believable positions of an outdated, brain-threatened NATO, misleading to the interests of U.S. cannons sellers and a senile and corrupt president.
23161	17	You remember the story of the Syrian princess who climbs on Jupiter dressed in a white bear, who takes her away and rape her? The brutality remains the same. It would be time for the donzella to go back, and the donzella is us, the peoples of Europe. I am still convinced that the European peoples will be able to build this space of peace, prosperity and cooperation only by getting rid of Washington’s custody and accepting to conceive themselves up to the Ural or Kamchatka. The first step is to demolish this toxic European Union.
23171	1	Paris 2024: Olympic Games Finals for France in Crisis
23171	3	The Olympic Games were to be a celebration, a sort of 1998 bis World Cup designed to make France and its political elites shine internationally. In a few years of political, health and economic crises, the pharaonic project for Paris has turned into a Damocles sword suspended above the head of Anne Hidalgo and Emmanuel Macron.
23171	5	Anne Hidalgo is dedicated to the Olympic Games with application after her spectacular disconvenient in the presidential election. Although re-elected to the mayor of Paris in June 2020, it gathered on its name only 1.7 percent of the French voters and 2.2 percent of the Parisian voters during the presidential campaign.
23171	7	Waiting for a media success
23171	9	Emmanuel Macron on his side was badly re-elected president in front of the rejection candidate Marine Le Pen. Weakened in the legislative elections, he is, like Anne Hidalgo, looking for the political and communication operation of scale that will put him on the roads.
23171	11	The two elected are therefore hoping for an important political benefit from the Olympics: if the media success is at the date, they will be able to return to the front of the scene not only national, but worldwide. Unlikely they are still in the forefront of Boris Johnson's triumph at the London City Hall, led by the 2012 Olympics.
23171	13	Only, organizing the Olympic Games is a costly operation, not to say ruined, when it cannot be sponged thanks to the good economic health of the host country.
23171	15	In 1992, for the Winter Olympics in Albertville, the state provided about 3 billion francs to modernize local infrastructure in order to improve communication between the municipalities hosting the 57 Olympic events. The idea, classicly Keynesian, was obviously aimed at boosting demand by public investments.
23171	17	The previous Albertville
23171	19	After the Games, the life in Albertville started back and the Court of Auditors estimated the operation’s deficit to 279 million francs in 1993. Unlike a technocratic idea received, which seems to have survived the fiasco of Albertville, it’s not the public spending related to the Olympics that attracts investors, but investors already on the site – a sign of the country’s good economic health – that allow to absorb these farming public money bleeding, as in London in 2012.
23171	21	As Henry Hazlitt reminded in his fundamental book Economics in one lesson, it must be remembered that any public spending is funded by tax, i.e. by the forced transfer of taxpayers resources to certain social groups. As a consequence, the “creation of wealth by expenditure” is preceded by a destruction of wealth by state coercion, which makes the exercise economically doubtful.
23171	23	The municipality of Paris has multiplied its debt by 200% in 20 years, reaching more than 7 billion by 2021. The French government’s debt increased by 600 billion under Emmanuel Macron’s presidency. According to a recent report, on the eve of the Olympics the mayor is unable to solve the serious insecurity problem that gangrends the capital (as the rest of the country). On the other hand, the state did not really shine on the subject as we saw it with its catastrophic management of incidents at the stadium of France.
23171	25	With the conflict in Ukraine, it is now the inflationist risk that risks to explode the costs of a limited budget for the moment to 4 billion euros.
23171	27	Emmanuel Macron and Anne Hidalgo hope to regain political health with the Olympics, but all indicators are red. That’s exactly the opposite that could happen: the veil of political-media communication could break down to reveal to the world that France is the real sick man of Europe.
23172	1	All decisions of Emmanuel Macron’s health policy cost more than 600 billion dollars, for what result?
23172	3	Health benefits are about 600 billion. In addition to the confinement, the vaccines account for a few billion as well. 146 million doses were administered for a price of 15 and 20 euros per dose according to periods. The only vaccination cost between 2.3 and 2.8 billion euros.
23172	5	With regard to the tests, well badly called anti-Covid, just the month of December and its 28 million tests cost a billion euros to health insurance. The Minister of Public Accounts acknowledged a month later that the anti-Covid tests cost 1.5 billion for January. Two months of testing cost 2.5 billion, what to do? The health policy is therefore a hystery of more than 600 billion euros.
23172	7	Minister of Finance Amnesty
23172	9	And we hear a finance minister talking about a “warning coast” with 3 billion euros of debt, which is 114.5% of GDP. Can he report on his responsibility and results as he has contributed to his abyssal growth? We were in 2017 at 2,200 billion and 98% of GDP. Can he explain the ratio of efficiency of this unprecedented expenditure in the economic history of France?
23172	11	The real value of this mad spending
23172	13	Let’s take the measure of this faramineous health expenditure. The annual operation of a departmental hospital is estimated in a range of 250 to 350 million euros. There are therefore 2,000 hospitals operating for a year where 100 departmental hospitals operating for 20 years. 600 billion is 15 years of the defence budget (a little less than 40 billion in 2021) or ten years of the national education budget (55 billion in 2021). Such a sacrifice ever engaged in the public expenditure of France requires a quick and perfect result, at the level of the expenditure and the promises exposed as the certainty of faith by all specialists, right? We all remember the aggressiveness, the science of certainty, the arrogance and contempt of Minister Veran in particular. 600 billion for what to do?
23172	15	Nullity of the result
23172	17	But, did this unknown expenditure get a result at the height, or the rapid eradication of the virus? No, since we are talking about a seventh wave, that people are still dying from this disease, even though very lucky, they are not thousands per day. But did this initial confinement release us from the disease? Not to. The second confinement? Not to. Does the vaccination work? No, since today the figures show that the sick are vaccinated as well as hospitalized. Charlatanism or fraud. Have the tests been useful? Not because the disease remains. What is the benefit of these $600 billion in public spending? And today we don’t have the ability to measure the cost of unwanted effects. It is likely to be high.
23172	19	Democratic Freedom of Inventory of Responsibilities
23172	21	Is it possible in a free and democratic society to ask our new elected members to open a transparent, even popular investigation committee, to demand answers on the responsibilities of these farming expenditure commitments? There are several issues here. Never repeat such a madness. The one to punish the ministers, or even the president at the height of this absolute madness. The one finally to solve this expenditure by means of financial measures and sanctions against those who have benefited, or even corrupt: European Union, laboratories, laboratory shareholders, complicated states, etc.
23172	23	The major challenge is to get rid of this irrational takeover of a few about the fate of the greatest number.
23172	25	They showed that they didn’t know anything.
23172	27	We now have the proof that the expenditure was irrational, irrational and today without a result. It is urgent to radically change paradigm. That’s the progress, right? At least, it is an obligation before asking the French to sacrifice himself again, whereas this debt must be settled by recovering it from the authors of this hystery.
23182	1	Thanks to the return to the pump, inflation should be achieved at the return.
23182	3	In July, consumer prices rose by 6.1 per cent over a year, the Insee said on Friday. According to economists, France could avoid a peak of inflation at 7%, especially thanks to the return to the pump increased to 30 cents in September. The deterioration of the international situation would also contribute to a calm on the labels.
23182	5	There is no rest for inflation, but reasons to hope for the next. In July, consumer prices flown by 6.1 per cent over a year, after rising by 5.8 per cent in June, according to the provisional estimate published Friday by the Insee. Never seen since the mid-1980s.
23182	7	Inflation is winning the entire economy. It increasingly affects services with prices increasing by 3.9% over a year, manufactured products (+2.9%) and food products. Over a year, these countries are now recording a tariff rise of 6.7%, which is more than the overall inflation.
23182	9	Energy prices still rise by 29 percent, however, slow down, reflecting the recent fall in oil prices. Over a month, consumer prices are only rising by 0.3% against +0.7% in June, also assured by the discounts offered during the balances. This is a sign of possible calmness.
23182	11	The positive impact of the return to 30 cents
23182	13	Today, economists also believe that the price rise in Hexagone will cease to accelerate. “The law on purchasing power and the likely asset of oil prices given the international situation should allow France to avoid a 7% inflation peak in September,” says Ana Boata, director of economic research at Allianz Trade.
23182	15	While the “tariff shield” on energy prices, as well as the re-pumping already allow France to have a lower inflation than other countries in the euro zone, the strengthening of the re-pumping from 18 to 30 cents in September could also have a sensitive effect.
23182	17	“If this measure is realised, it could lower the inflation level by a few dozen points,” says Julien Pouget, head economist of the Insee. “The impact of the 18 centimeters discount was estimated at 0.4 points less on the overall annual price shift in April and May,” he reminds.
23182	19	The deterioration of the international situation – the contraction of U.S. activity, the slowdown in China and Germany – should also contribute to calming prices. “The oil prices have slightly dropped, and may eventually continue to fall, on the background of quite uncertain global economic prospects,” the economist of the Insee also pointed out “a already perceived relaxation on the prices of wheat and certain raw materials.” And “conjunktural surveys show a slowdown in the expectations of price rise in the industry,” he adds.
23182	21	Is this enough to bring the consumption of households back in Bern from the beginning of the year? This is the scenario of some experts. “If inflation calms, households are expected to restore their spending in the coming months. And that’s especially because the new devices that are being examined in Parliament will support purchasing power,” says Stéphane Colliac at BNP-Paribas. Bercy plans to gain 0.5 points of household purchasing power this year. “But household consumption should not return to its pre-crisis level until mid-2023,” says Stéphane Colliac. Some prices are expected to continue to rise: at the end of the year, the increase in food products could thus reach 8.5% over a year, according to the expert.
23183	1	Draghi, it’s over, but then?
23183	3	"""Super Mario,"" as it was called since the euro's rescue, has resigned from the Italian Council's presidency. For “La Story”, the news podcast of “Echos”, Michèle Warnet and her guests decrypt the new political crisis that Italy is experiencing and what it hopes for the future."
23183	5	Political shock in Italy. Mario Draghi gave his resignation as Chairman of the Council, released by the coalition he had formed just 17 months ago. It included its Allied League and Forza Italia but also the 5-Star Movement. His package opens a new political crisis in Italy. It also occurs in a tight socio-economic and geopolitical context. Draghi’s departure to reach the European Union but is undoubtedly celebrated in the Kremlin which has faithful allies among Italian populists, such as Matteo Salvini.
23183	7	Now all the opponents of Super Mario, the surname he had inherited by saving the euro zone in 2012, have thrown themselves into the campaign. The parliamentary elections scheduled for spring 2023 were advanced by the end of September and will take place at the worst time for Italy. The country has to reduce its dependence on Russian gas and carry out difficult reforms to receive funds from the European Recovery Plan.
23183	9	Plan of recovery
23183	11	While the nationalist parties have the wind in puppy in Italy, the European Union could block funds in the face of a new coalition that would appear eurosceptic and decentralized. Italy is one of the largest beneficiaries of the EU resuscitation plan, but reforms were the guarantee for it. Mario Draghi has launched a lot of things, but all of this will be a stop. For Italy it is a period of strong uncertainty that opens and the markets have recorded it.
23185	1	With MBS, Macron talked about Ukraine, energy, terrorism, Israel-Palestine... and a bit of human rights.
23185	3	A diplomatic language concentrate after a controversial meeting. On the day after the dinner held in Elysée between Emmanuel Macron and Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salmane, Elysée returned on Friday on the content of their exchanges. Besides the welcome of “MBS” on Wednesday evening by the Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire, his stay in his castle of the Yvelines and the images of a long hand in hand with the French head of state on the perron of the Elysée, nothing has filtered from this meeting.
23185	5	"The two men expressed the desire to deepen the relationship between the two countries and to continue their consultation to address regional and global challenges, including the fight against climate warming and its consequences. In a message addressed to Emmanuel Macron, MBS emphasizes his ""deep gratitude"" and his ""thankings for the warm welcome and hospitality"" that were reserved for him during this official visit."
23185	7	The human rights issue “adjusted”
23185	9	This visit of King Salman’s son was the first in the European Union since the assassination, on October 2, 2018, of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Critic of the Saudi authority, the journalist was sordidly murdered in the premises of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as he came to seek the necessary documents for his marriage. According to the U.S. intelligence, it was the MBS who ordered the murder. Ben Salmane’s departure to Paris was heavily criticized by a part of the political class, when two human rights NGOs complained for “complicity of torture” and “forced disappearance.” Hatice Cengiz, the bride of Jamal Khashoggi, has, on her side, called “scandalized and upset” of the reception reserved to the Saudi prince by the French head of state.
23185	11	In a laconic phrase, at the very end of the statement, Elysée assures that “in the framework of the trust dialogue between France and Saudi Arabia, the President of the Republic has addressed the issue of human rights in Arabia.” Before the official dinner, the surroundings of the head of state had indicated that this question would be addressed “in general” but also around “individual cases”. Emmanuel Macron was already the first Western leader to travel to Saudi Arabia after Jamal Khashoggi's death, during a tour to the Gulf countries in December 2021.
23185	13	While the war in Ukraine still largely occupies Emmanuel Macron’s international agenda, the latter expressed his “deep concerns” with regard to the “disastrous impact on civilian populations and its impacts on food security,” the castle’s statement said. The dinner menu included the sensitive issue of the gas supply of the European countries.
23185	15	The Elysée renter insisted in front of his host on the “importance” of engaging in the “diversification of energy supplies” for the EU countries. While Russian gas supplies are in a sharp decline, European capitals are multiplying bilateral trade with other producing states (in particular Algeria, Qatar and Azerbaijan) in order to find alternative supply sources.
23185	17	War in Syria and Yemen at the meeting menu
23185	19	"The discussions between the two leaders also turned around the “medium to continue the coordination in the fight against terrorism and the preservation of security,” he said. While MBS has undertaken vast reforms and large-scale projects in Saudi Arabia, such as the futurist megalopoly called “Neom”, Emmanuel Macron also wanted to defend Thursday evening the “disponibility of French companies to accompany this transformation.” Although the areas of the energy transition and transportation are quoted by the Elysée, no signature of a possible agreement between Paris and Riyadh has, for the moment, been announced by Paris. In a statement, Saudi authorities stated that ""the ways to deepen the investment partnership"" between the two countries in the fields of renewable energy and in particular hydrogen have been discussed."
23185	21	Another topic of Thursday evening exchanges, the Iranian nuclear dossier. Since March, negotiations to resume the 2015 agreement are at the dead point. This agreement aimed at lifting the Western sanctions targeting Tehran in exchange for a strict control of its nuclear program. Following an interview with Iranian President Ebrahim Raïssi on Saturday 23 July, Emmanuel Macron said that the renewal of this agreement “was still possible,” provided that it intervenes “in the shortest time possible.” On this issue, the French head of state intends “to foster dialogue and regional integration” and pushes the idea of a new meeting in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, by the end of the year and calqueed on the model of the conference held in August 2021. The Saudi party mentioned the “international efforts aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon” and “to peace the Iranian nuclear program”.
23185	23	With his Saudi counterpart, the President of the Republic finally addressed the situation in Lebanon, repeating his will to “force” the “cooperation” with Saudi Arabia, especially on the humanitarian level. The case of Syria, and in particular the northeastern part of the country, where the fighting of Kurdish fighters against Turkey, has also been mentioned. The Elysée’s tenant reiterated his “attack to ceasefire” in the region.
23185	25	The head of state also took advantage of this dinner to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The war in Yemen, finally, where Saudi Arabia in the head of a coalition fights the Houthi rebels, is one of the topics discussed, according to Elisei. He greeted “Saudi Arabia’s efforts for a political, comprehensive and inclusive solution under the UN’s leadership and expressed its desire for a prolonged ceasefire.”
23188	1	United States: Not all is a national emergency
23188	3	In the United States, if the National Emergency Act is not reformed, the presidents will continue to abuse it to press Congress.
23188	5	After Senator Joe Manchin (elected Democrat in West Virginia) rejected the climate legislation of his own party, President Joe Biden said:
23188	7	Action on climate change and clean energy remains more urgent than ever. So I will be clear: if the Senate does not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our national clean energy industry, I will take strong executive measures to respond to it. »
23188	9	On Monday evening, citing three anonymous sources, the Washington Post revealed what this action could be: “Biden is planning to declare a national climate emergency,” and this could happen “from this week.”
23188	11	According to the Washington Post, the activists believe that a national emergency would allow Biden “to stop the exports of crude oil, to limit oil and gas drilling in federal waters and to order agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stimulate renewable energy sources.”
23188	13	Although political realities – especially high fuel prices and inflation – and the inevitable trials initiated by the Republicans can stop Biden, the activists are right to say that emergency statements are a powerful stimulant of the presidential power.
23188	15	And that is the problem. Emergency statements have become a lazy political replacement solution, a way for presidents to circumvent Congress when it has not done its work or, in some cases, has hardly rejected what the president wanted. National emergencies have become an escape to the administrative anarchy, and they have a great need to be reformed.
23188	17	National Emergency Act
23188	19	In their current form, emergencies are governed by the National Emergency Act of 1976.
23188	21	Since Jimmy Carter the presidents have declared 75 emergencies invoking the authority of this law, and approximately half of these statements, many of which now date from several decades, remain in force today.
23188	23	Some of them relate to situations (for example, the immediate consequences of the September 11 attacks) which can be qualified as national emergencies.
23188	25	Others are obviously not, such as those sanctioning the people who undermine democracy in Zimbabwe and Belarus, two emergencies initially declared under the administration of George W. Bush and resumed by Mr. Biden. Regardless of the severity of these situations for the people of Zimbabwe and Belarus, they are not an emergency for the United States, and Congress would have been able to act if he wanted it.
23188	27	Climate change is of a more obvious importance for our country and may be an emergency in the familiar sense of the term. But with regard to his legal status, the formulation of Mr. Biden’s threat puts the chip to our ears: if the Senate does not move, he says, the administration will act in its place. But the very interest of an emergency declaration is that it allows the federal government to act when the Congress has no time to do so. Congress had a year and a half of democratic trio governance to act on climate change and did not do as Mr. Biden wanted. Yes, it’s mainly Manchin’s fault, to the great frustration of his democratic colleagues. Unfortunately for them, Manchin is part of Congress, and the problem here is simply not the lack of Congress’s opportunity to act.
23188	29	As the former Liberal representative Justin Amash said:
23188	31	“A emergency does not trigger an endless debate without consensus, nor is it addressed with a plan that requires years of execution. A house burns, a boat flows, a city is flooded – these situations are considered emergencies precisely because everyone agrees to say they require immediate action. »
23188	33	National emergency statements are not made when a senator does not want to vote as the president wishes. It is also not a presidential chantage tool that aims to force the legislative power to stick to the executive’s requirements. Despite all the openness it shows to presidential abuses, the National Emergency Act did not aim to completely reverse the conception of the Constitution regarding the course of the federal action. Unfortunately, recent presidents have understood how emergency statements could be used for this purpose.
23188	35	Biden's attempt to force the Senate on climate change remarkably reminds the threat of former President Donald Trump in 2019 to declare a national emergency in order to obtain funds to build his so promised border wall.
23188	37	Elizabeth Goitein from the Brennan Center for Justice in The Atlantic wrote that:
23188	39	“Trump might think that Congress’s repeated failure to provide funds shows the need for urgent action. The truth is exactly the opposite. By giving Congress time to definitively establish his refusal to fund the border wall, Trump removes both any legitimate justification for an emergency action and proves his intention to subvert the constitutional balance of powers. »
23188	41	Change a few words and the same criticism applies to Biden and climate change.
23188	43	As long as the national emergency law is not reformed, the presidents will continue to abuse it to press Congress, as Trump and Biden did.
23188	45	The law must be amended to strictly limit its reasons and duration and to define more precisely the scope and nature of the problems that these statements may address, as well as the duration during which the state of emergency may continue without the approval of the President's plan by the Congress.
23188	47	This period should be short enough – a few days, instead of the current six months – so that legislators are forced to examine emergency measures on the basis of their own merits rather than automatically approve well-established federal programs. If this is really an emergency, even our legislators should be able to gather together to act.
2319	1	Russia will not allow the launch of a Third World War, Medvedev said
2319	3	Medvedev, Vice-President of the Security Council, said that Russia will not let a Third World War break out.
2319	5	Russia will not allow the launch of a Third World War and, in case of an attack, it is ready to react accordingly, said Vice-President of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev.
2319	7	“The arsenal of modern, reliable and effective weapons today refreshed the ambitions of those who are ready to trigger the Third World War with their own hands and those of others. We will not allow such a situation. But we are obliged to constantly remind you that in case of an attack on our country, we are able to give an immediate and superpowerful response. Remove any desire for aggression that would threaten our state,” he wrote on his Telegram channel.
2319	9	On Tuesday, he visited the Institute of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics of the RFNC-VNIIEF in Sarov and held a meeting on the development prospects of the National Center for Physics and Mathematics.
2319	11	The main task of the Institute is to develop new methods and new mathematical programs, mainly in the interest of the Russian nuclear weapons complex, as well as for other fields. The Institute's mathematical base with the available software is one of the most powerful in Russia.
23190	1	"Researchers propose to place a ""bubble screen"" in space to fight climate warming"
23190	3	Droughts, extreme heat waves and major fires are now touching the whole world. Many cities have beat their record summer temperatures this summer. Despite international efforts to combat global warming, we have already reached a point of non-return? What if we can’t keep the temperature rise below +2 °C? In this event, scientists are working on “the last chance” solutions, geo-engineering solutions that could limit damages, or even reverse climate change.
23190	5	Geo-engineering combines all the techniques that make it possible to manipulate the Earth’s climate and environment. Inspired by an idea suggested by astronomer Robert Angel, a MIT team is currently working on a concept of solar shield, whose role would be to mitigate the solar radiation that reaches our planet. In fact, if efforts to reduce CO2 emissions were insufficient to reverse climate change, it would already be indispensable to act directly on our main heat source.
23190	7	The project, called “Space Bubbles”, consists of a kind of giant radar composed of frozen bulbs (approximately the size of Brazil according to the team), which would be positioned at the point of Lagrange L1, between the Sun and the Earth. The structure would be designed to reflect a part of the sunlight. The advantage of this approach compared to other geo-engineering projects — such as dissolving chemicals in the stratosphere to increase its albedo — is that it’t directly affect the Earth’s biosphere.
23190	9	Thin film bubbles directly swallowed into space
23190	11	"In geo-engineering, solar geo-engineering has been little explored. In 1989, James Early presented in the newspaper of the British Interplanetary Society a concept of ""thin glass shield"" to compensate for the greenhouse effects caused by the accumulation of CO2. This shield was to be built from lunar materials and positioned at the first point of Lagrange of the Earth-Sun system in order to absorb a part of radiation. Such a shield would reduce the incident light by 1.8% — which would be enough to reverse the current warming. At the time there were problems related to the amount of equipment needed to produce this giant solar vessel and the energy needed to launch it to its destination."
23190	13	From this work, Roger Angel considered in 2006 not one, but several small solar shields. This shield would aim to deviate a part of the light rather than to absorb it, in order to minimize the L1 balance gap caused by the radiation pressure, the scientist explained at the time. Despite a reduced mass compared to James Early’s project and the implementation of an electromagnetic acceleration to escape Earth’s gravity, followed by ionic propulsion (to limit transport costs), the manufacture and deployment of this solar eclipse remained very complex.
23190	15	Some other ideas have emerged since then, but none has exceeded the stage of the approximate feasibility study. As we are progressively moving towards a climate emergency, a MIT team has reflected on Angel’s proposal: it proposes to deploy a set of bulb radars, composed of networks of small swallowable bulbs interconnected near the Lagrange L1 point. “We believe that the swelling of thin film spheres directly into space from a homogeneous folded material – like silicon – can provide the thickness variation that reflects a broader wave spectrum and allows us to avoid the need to launch large structural film elements,” the researchers explain.
23190	17	A shield that could be set up before the end of the century
23190	19	Here it is about making reflective spheres directly in space, which would limit transportation costs. The solution would also be completely reversible: the bulbs could be destroyed simply by breaking their surface balance, which would also minimize space waste compared to other approaches. It could therefore be one of the most efficient thin layer structures to deviate solar radiation.
23190	21	It remains to determine the appropriate material and technology to produce and maintain such spheres in space. The team has already tested the manufacture of bubbles in the laboratory, in the conditions of the extra-atmospheric space; they are interested in silicon-based mixture and graphene-fortified ionic fluids, which have ultra-bass steam pressure and relatively low densities. The thermal and optical properties of the materials will also be taken into account for the feasibility study.
23190	23	According to the researchers, the minimum thickness of the liquid film that forms the bulbs can theoretically be as low as 20 nanometers; but to deviate the sunlight, it must be comparable to the solar wave lengths, or about 400 to 600 nanometers. Finally, the bulbs had a mass density less than 1.5 g/m2. Its optimal location would be a little closer to the Sun, approximately 2.5 million kilometers from Earth, in order to reduce radiation pressure.
23190	25	There are a number of questions to be discussed before considering the implementation of such a project. In particular, it is necessary to consider the maintenance of the shield once in place, because the bulbs will be fragile. It is also essential to consider the impact that the reduction of solar radiation will have on our planet and the transition phase that will be necessary both when the shield is set up and when it is no longer useful. According to preliminary studies, 50 to 200 years of activity will be needed to reverse the effects of warming.
23190	27	A Roger Angel estimate is about 0.5% of the global GDP over the past 50 years the cost of such a project. If preliminary laboratory experiments prove conclusive, further research will aim to improve its design and tests will be carried out in low orbit. “We believe that once a technical solution is identified, its implementation could take place before the end of the century,” the researchers estimate.
23192	1	 “The problem of insecurity will not be resolved until the problem of immigration is addressed.” 
23192	3	The delegate of the Institute for Justice Pierre-Marie Sève says in Le Figaro:
23192	5	In Angers, in the night of 15 to 16 July, three young people were killed by a knife. After being intervened to defend a young girl victim of sexual assault, these three young people, one of whom was a minor, were killed by a Sudanese refugee armed with a slaughter knife. Last night, a homeless man was killed with a knife in Amiens, by two Tunisians in irregular situation. A few days earlier, a 46-year-old Montpellier was attacked and wounded with a knife by an Eritrean, who was also in an irregular situation. It’s difficult not to see a link between the externality of those attacks and this particular operational mode of the knife attack. In fact, if this link is not systematic, foreigners, which represent less than 10% of the population, are clearly overrepresented among the authors.
23192	7	Attack on the knife is also very closely linked to Islamic terrorism. The Islamic State has made it one of its specialties. Last Christmas, a project of a knife attack was, for example, disguised by the French intelligence services. Another example: in 2019, in a sadly famous Islamic State propaganda video seen hundreds of thousands of times, a terrorist called to kill the French on their ground with these words: “No need a gun of attack or a gun of ring, a simple white weapon is enough.” Finally, this exacerbated violence had reached a summit during the assassination of Samuel Paty, decapitated with a knife. While the government has just announced its will to expel foreign criminals, this wave of knife aggression is the symbol of a central dimension of insecurity: its connection with immigration. It is, of course, not a matter of essentializing wrongly: a large portion of violence in France has no connection with immigration and takes place in France, among French.
23192	9	But many elements tend to remind that the insecurity problem will never be resolved until its connection to immigration is not addressed. As a report from the Institute for Justice reminds, it is first and foremost the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior itself that note a surrepresentation of foreigners in crime and crime. In 2019, there were 7.4% of foreigners among the French population. However, in each category of crimes and crimes of the Criminal Code, the proportion of foreign prosecutors is higher. Foreigners are therefore overrepresented in all categories of crimes and crimes of the Criminal Code: from murders to sexual crimes through car theft or fraud. This overrepresentation, which does not even take into account the people from the immigration who became French, is logically found in the proportion of foreigners in prison. In October 2021, the Ministry of Justice would count 24,5% of foreigners in French prisons. Another surrepresentation. Going further, we can think that immigration, even becoming French, can be a generator of violence. The famous study “The denial of cultures” by sociologist Hugues Lagrange found, in 2013, that adolescents educated in the Sahel families are 3 to 4 times more frequently involved in crimes than adolescents raised in indigenous families. The [...]
23194	1	America flirted with the leftist disaster – it’s time to stop the compromises
23194	3	The political left as a movement has proved to be composed of some of the worst people imaginable – the kind of people who are thirsty for destruction and enjoy oppressing others. They may think they enjoy a form of anarchy, but they are in fact all the opposite: they are the creators of chaos, but only as a means of obtaining complete control.
23194	5	However, while the leftists give me the chicken meat with their sharp odor of evil, there is a group of people that is even more boring, and it is the one of “persons-who-not-who-who-who-who-who-who-who” and false moderate.
23194	7	Though these people never admit it, it happens that a social conflict arises and that one side is completely right while the other side is completely wrong. The false moderates claim that the side that is wrong has merits, even if there are no, because they want to look “wise.” The truth is that they don’t have the courage to take a position in one direction or the other, and therefore they act as if none of the two sides were right, or as if both sides were partially right.
23194	9	In other words, the destruction camp is allowed to pursue its pillages because, yeah, we don’t want to give the impression of being discriminatory or partial, right?
23194	11	Thus societies and cultures are slowly but inevitably deleted and the principles that are dear to them are reduced to nothing. This is mainly done through apathy and a quiet tolerance of corruption. The compromise is the factory mark of “democracy”, and it is also the root of tyrannia. If people did not compromise their principles and freedoms, tyrannia could not exist. That’s why the Founder Fathers of the United States opposed pure democracy and formed our nation as a constitutional republic with brakes and counterweights. Democracy alone often requires the acceptance of toxic and oppressive behaviors that we could otherwise stop, all this in the name of the calming of the “most.”
23194	13	Discrimination can sometimes be a good thing. It is a biological imperative that contributes to tribalism and has allowed humanity to survive as a species for thousands of years. Without the ability to discriminate, all behaviors, no matter how radioactive they are, would proliferate, and this is what we are facing today in Western societies.
23194	15	When tribes were faced with narcissistic, psychopathic or purely schizophrene and delirant members, these people were often rejected or ignored, and for good reasons. When fools and sociopaths are allowed to integrate into a culture, they are also allowed to inject a certain level of moral madness into that culture. Madness is generally an innate condition, but madness habits can also be learned, and if people think there are advantages and gains associated with acting insensibly, some of them will do so and the problem will worsen.
23194	17	The political left claims that all discriminatory trends are a form of sectarism. However, they are among the most sectarian people on the planet when it comes to opposite ideals and beliefs. We can see this attitude in their own policies and in the people they seek to censor. They are pleased to accept the complete deletion of all the ideas that contradict their beliefs and they do so because they know, with enough time, that this type of censorship works.
23194	19	They try to overthrow the old tribal model – Today, anyone who is “healthy of mind” must be converted or rejected from society.
23194	21	There are many examples. Anyone who emphasizes the lack of science behind transgender ideology and fluid gender theory is immediately considered a “bigot” and must be thrown away. Anyone who question extreme ecologism and carbon control is a “climate negativist” and must be expelled. Anyone who question the “medical experts” paid by the government and their draconic obligations is “anti-science” and must be expelled. Anyone who claims that the theory of the critical race is highly inaccurate and misleading is a “rasist” and must be expelled. Anyone who thinks that teachers should not be allowed to sexualize children in schools and to exploit them for their own psychological satisfaction is a “homophobe” that must be thrown away. The list is still long.
23194	23	I have even seen leftists in the media defending hateful acts such as pedophilia, because being deeply opposed to a character trait of every human being is committing the greatest sin of the leftist religion – Who are you to question an individual’s internal “truth” and set limits to his behavior? You have become intolerant, and you are therefore a heretic.
23194	25	Don’t misunderstand yourself, this philosophy of “fairness” may seem to be a random madness but it serves a very specific agenda. If all behaviors must be tolerated, then any evil can become acceptable. The only bad action you can then do is intolerance to evil. Do you see how it works?
23194	27	Psychopaths and those who lack empathy can now rule on our culture because they cannot be faced without great social risk. In a world where everyone is a good person in the bottom, the idea of ‘fairness’ could work (probably not), but in a world where inherent evil exists and where these people have no scrupule to hurt who they want to get what they want, a culture built on fairness is devoted to self-destruction. All they have to do is claim that they are part of a oppressed class, a group of victims, and that you therefore have no right to question their actions.
23194	29	If men want to claim to be women and invade women’s sports, women’s clothes, women’s toilets, women’s prisons and women’s health, we have to let them do, for if we don’t do it, we negate their “existence” as they see it in their own heads. If a pedophile wants to commit a act of pedophilia, we must let it, because if we do not, we are guilty of discrimination against a psychological minority. If a mother wants to kill her baby for convenience, we must let her do, because who are we to tell her that she must face the consequences of her sexual acts? The leftists do not believe in moral borders, but only in political borders. The only behaviors that can be limited are those that are in conflict with their ideology.
23194	31	The last months have been quite surprising in terms of Supreme Court decisions and I can only hope that this represents a step forward in relation to the extreme flirt of our nation with leftism. The final result of the philosophy “do what you want” is clear as the day – It can only lead to a complete collapse of society and the endoctrination of future generations. And maybe, just maybe, some members of the Supreme Court have understood it.
23194	33	Decisions in favour of the right to self-defense according to the Constitution eventually ended the political left obsession of disarming its opponents. They see the second amendment as the last bastion of a conservative culture that opposes their plans to absorb America, turning it into something unknown in the process. As in all authoritarian regimes, the leftists seek to withdraw the right to defend themselves from anyone who does not believe like them. Their dreams are broken, for now.
23194	35	The decision to end the Roe v. Wade sentence and the federal abortion protection is the most surprising of all. Leftists see cultural tolerance of child murder as their greatest victory. It is not the body of women or the rights of women; if abortion concerns the “human rights,” then they should honestly take into account the rights of the child in the uterus. But they will not do so, because the rights are not relevant to them. What is actually about abortion is to change the limits of what Americans are willing to tolerate morally. What long-standing virtues are we willing to sacrifice, and how many children are we willing to sacrifice in the name of “tolerance and justice”?
23194	37	This is a game, you see. It is a game played by psychopaths. And the goal of the game is to see if they can make sure that all the people around them act exactly as they do. Can we go through the dark side? This is the purpose of this game, and they enjoy the idea that in the bottom, everyone is as bad as they are.
23195	1	Nancy Pelosi in Asia with a possible delicate step in Taiwan
23195	3	The president of the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to be on Monday in Singapore, the first step of an Asian tour that could include a passage to Taiwan.
23195	5	The move could further poison the already tensioned relations between Beijing and Washington. After long keeping the fool around his an Asian program, Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday to lead “a Congress delegation in the Indo-Pacific region to reaffirm America’s unbeatable commitment to its allies and friends in the region.”
23195	7	“In Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, we will hold high-level meetings to discuss how we can promote our values and common interests, including peace and security, economic growth and trade, Covid-19 pandemic, climate crisis, human rights and democratic governance,” she added.
23195	9	increased tensions
23195	11	For weeks, tensions between the United States and China have increased as a result of information that it could go to the autonomous island, which China considers as part of its territory.
23195	13	Beijing would see a passage, even briefly, of the President of the House of Representatives on the island as a provocation. Delegations of U.S. officials frequently go to Taiwan to express their support, but a visit to Nancy Pelosi, one of the highest figures in the state and one of the heavy weights of U.S. political life, would be unprecedented since that of his predecessor Newt Gingrich in 1997.
23195	15	“Strategic ambiguity”
23195	17	"The U.S. practices a so-called ""strategic ambiguity"" diplomacy against Taiwan, consisting in recognizing only one Chinese government, Beijing, while continuing to provide decisive support to Taipei but abstaining to say whether or not they would militaryly defend the island in case of an invasion. It is this concept that has so far managed to maintain a certain stability in the region."
23195	19	As for Nancy Pelosi, the sequence is delicate: the President of the House of Representatives is a central figure of the Democratic majority of President Joe Biden, but his possible stop in Taiwan would complicate the task of the U.S. diplomacy, which strives not to poison relations with China.
23195	21	Last week, on the occasion of a rare direct exchange with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, U.S. President Joe Biden had assured that the U.S. position on Taiwan had “not changed” and that his country “was strongly opposed to unilateral efforts to change the status quo or threaten peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”
23195	23	“Red Line”
23195	25	"On his side, Xi Jinping had called on Joe Biden not to ""play with fire"", and a spokesman for Chinese diplomacy had spoken about Nancy Pelosi's move to the island as a ""red line""."
23195	27	Nancy Pelosi’s visit occurs as military tensions rise in the region.
23195	29	The Taiwan Army conducted its most important annual military exercises this week, which included simulations of interception of Chinese attacks from the sea.
23195	31	At the same time, the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and his fleet left Singapore to head to the South China Sea as part of a planned operation, the U.S. Navy said.
23195	33	"And on Saturday, as a response, China organized a ""real ammunition"" military exercise in the Taiwan Strait."
23195	35	Washington sought to minimize the importance of Nancy Pelosi’s possible visit to Taiwan and called on Chinese leaders to be calm.
23195	37	“We have many differences regarding Taiwan, but over the past four decades we have managed these differences and did so in a way that preserved peace and stability,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday.
23195	39	In Taiwan, the opinions are shared on the perspective of Nancy Pelosi’s visit, but figures from the ruling party and opposition said the island should not surrender to Chinese pressure.
23203	1	France: Racist remarks are acceptable after 75 years
23203	2	A survey published on Wednesday revealed that an immense majority of the French (96%) believe racist remarks are acceptable when the individual is at least 75 years old.
23203	6	“Before that age, it’s much more delicate. The French consider that the person does not enjoy an age sufficiently advanced to justify his controversial and generally judged opinions as coming from another era,” explains Stéphane Truchi, Chairman of the Directorate of the French Institute of Public Opinion. “In contrast, a 75-year-old person was born in 1946, which makes it possible to assume that she grew up in a so different world that it causes a hardly controllable impact on the brain, which explains their racial injuries to unexpected moments of the Christmas meal,” he continues. “A adult educated in the 1970s could very well maintain a respectful status in society by making remarks on the black and the Arabs, and even on the ‘Mahometans’. French people realize that they can’t simply stop loving their grandparents just because they have racial assumptions that make everyone uncomfortable. »
23203	8	“As someone going over his 75 years next week, I’m really happy to learn this and I’m looking forward to getting out my controversial vocabulary for the end of the year,” says Frédéric, a retired man who so far had to walk on the top of his feet to not offset anyone.
23203	10	The survey also revealed some exceptions. For example, the age of acceptable racism can be reduced to 60 years if it’s a senile individual and the age criterion can even completely disappear “if it’s someone really beautiful other than that. »
23205	1	COP 26 is committed to recycling the promises of the other COP
23205	2	It is an unprecedented agreement that concluded COP 26 today: the states have indeed committed to recycling all the promises of the previous COP.
23205	4	“This is a huge victory for the environment. No new promise will come to pollute this COP placed under the sign of “zero waste” said former Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma, after the COP 26, after two weeks of harsh negotiations between the states. In addition to committed to recycling all the promises of the other COP, the COP 26 has promised to use the same sheets and the same ink, just changing the dates on the previous documents. She also committed not to consume promises too quickly and to make them sustainable and renewable. Thus, for at least ten years, the following COPs will not be able to develop new environmentally expensive projects.
23205	6	Examples of COP
23205	8	When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and waste management, including plastic, the leaders preferred to get into touch: “You can’t treat everything at the same time, at the risk of being ineffective,” Emmanuel Macron justified. The COP was an example of this. “We also secure to use the same language elements as usual and to recycle a large part of our demagogical statements from the previous years. “Barbara Pompili, the ecological transition minister.
23205	10	To give concrete guarantees of the government’s commitment, Emmanuel Macron has already promised to organize “a Great Environmental Debate by Horizon 2030”. In the meantime, a green number was set up by Jean Castex.
23208	1	From Texas, Viktor Orban calls on U.S. Conservatives to “unite their forces” against the “cultural war” led by the left
23208	3	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Thursday, during a trip to Texas, invited U.S. conservatives to “unite their forces” in the struggle he intends to conduct against “left progressists.”
23208	4	“We have to coordinate the movement of our troops, because we are facing the same challenge,” said the nationalist leader, invited to the U.S. Conservative Mass in Dallas, where Donald Trump must also speak.
23208	6	“The progressists of today are trying to separate the Western civilization from its Christian roots,” he said.
23208	8	Under a ton of applause, the 59-year-old leader insisted on the need to “recover the control of institutions” in Washington and Brussels, mentioning the upcoming US mid-mandate elections in November.
23208	10	“I’m here to tell you that we must unite our forces,” he said, calling on the conservatives to “create their own rules” against a “cultural war.”
23208	12	In a virulent speech on July 23, Viktor Orban had already rejected the vision of a “multiethnic” society. “We don’t want to be a mixed race,” which would blend with “non-Europeans,” he said, raising a rain of condemnations from the European Union and the United States.
23210	1	Sanctions against Russia: Marine Le Pen is “ready to sell our Republic for a dish of lenses”
23210	3	National Assembly leader Marine Le Pen called for the abandonment of the sanctions against Russia, a statement called “extremely dangerous, irresponsible” by energy transition minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher on CNews on Wednesday 3 August.
23210	5	It’s not the taste of Agnes Pannier-Runacher. On Tuesday, the leader of the National Assembly Marine Le Pen demanded the abandonment of the sanctions imposed against Russia due to the war in Ukraine because, according to her, they “do not serve strictly to anything” except to “do suffering” Europeans.
23210	7	"""I wish"" that the sanctions ""disappear in order to prevent Europe from facing a blackout, especially regarding gas imports,"" the RN deputy leader said during a press conference at the National Assembly. “These sanctions are strictly nothing but to hurt the European peoples and, accidentally, the French people,” she said, adding that “we are much more victims of these sanctions than Russia.”"
23210	9	The Minister of Energy Transition reacted on Wednesday on the CNews antenna. “The political person who claims to be the most patriot is in fact the first to be ready to sell our Republic for a lens dish to Russia,” Agnès Pannier-Runacher said.
23210	11	“We need to be solidary.”
23210	13	“I think this is an extremely dangerous, irresponsible statement, and in any case, this European solidarity is our best collective backdrop. We saw it during the covid crisis with our ability to raise vaccine production chains and vaccinate – we are the continent that has done this exercise the fastest of all continents on the planet,” she continued.
23210	15	“It’s a crisis that we didn’t want, but that’s global today – it’s not just Europe’s own. In any case, it is necessary that we remain very solidary and that we do not leave anything on the principles of the Republic and democracy,” said Agnès Pannier-Runacher.
2322	1	On Sunday, you will vote for peace or war.
2322	3	"On Sunday, you will vote for peace or war. This is not a joke or an art of propaganda. You look with fear and sadness at the images of the war in Ukraine that bring us back to the horrors of the last century. However, when Ukraine bombed its own Russian-speaking populations in Dombass, the media told you little about it. If it was a conflict between the far China and Thailand, it would scare you less, but there the noise of the canons is much closer. If you don’t want to hear it at home, measure the challenges, or more precisely the main and vital issue: peace or war. In Ukraine outside Dombass, two months ago, people lived normally with their emotional, professional life, their business and leisure, their daily concerns and their plans. If you don’t want the same situation that is their today, vote for peace, that is, for the only of the two candidates who want to take distances with NATO. Do you like Marine Le Pen? I also not. Do you don’t like the “extreme”? I also not. More reason not to vote for the extreme-center that, by its passivity, leads us to disaster. It has long been that it is no longer a matter of voting for the left or right, whose behavior of the Elysée's mental ill has succeeded in synthesis and proof of their little difference with its famous ""at the same time"", but rather of voting patriot or globalistic. And there is also a matter of voting for peace or war."
2322	5	We have no chance of winning this war, our army has a lot of obsolete equipment that has ended uselessly in Mali, has only three days of ammunition in case of high-intensity conflict. Furthermore, its weak staff consists of 25% of people from other countries whose patriotism is subject to many doubts but the betrayal to much less. No one has ever won against Russia, neither Napoleon nor Hitler, despite the enormous means that the latter had committed. It is observed that a large number of locations where struggles are taking place today in Ukraine are the same as those where harsh struggles took place during World War II: Kharkov, Lvov, Taganrog and many others. But Russian patriotism has always won. This is the proof that history repeats itself, contrary to what some journalists or historians claim. So remember that France entered war in 1914 and in 1939 because of badly studied and late respected alliances while prevention could have been enough to save peace. We are here today with NATO.
2322	7	"The NATO (""the machine"" as De Gaulle said) supposed to protect us against the USSR, would logically have to be dissolved when it disappeared. But on the contrary, it served to increase the hegemony of the United States, which are very skillful and have even made a routine to provoke wars, but above all not at home! With its expansion, NATO has become, by circumcision, a threat to Russia with which we should still maintain good relations, even if only because it is our neighbor in Eastern Europe, also because of a Christian culture, like us. The U.S. has pushed Ukraine to the conflict in Dombass and now they would like to train us all in this war where there will be only losers. If we do not separate ourselves from NATO, the war will come to us. The globalists want to make us believe that there will be war if we choose Marine Le Pen. If we choose Macron, we will still have that mental ill for five years and the war in a few weeks. Like the rest of the time, the Americans will supply weapons to the countries in conflict, bomb out and land to the end to throw the browns out of the fire. Then they will sell for gold a new Marshall Plan to reconstruct as they did with fifteen European countries after World War II. Meanwhile, the German Ford factories were supplied with engines from the United States through “neutral” countries. During the previous time, the French army was also driving in the Ford T, today it runs in the Ford Ranger. So see where the interests are."
2322	9	As for NATO wars, remember the latest: Yugoslavia bombed for three long months, including Belgrade for several weeks with the proven false pretext of the Muslim genocide by the Serbs. The result: a Muslim state in the middle of Europe, mafia and corrupt, stolen from Serbia, with the largest U.S. base on the continent! Remember the war in Iraq, the alleged weapons of mass destruction held by this country and never found... Remember the support of the Syrian jihadists who did the “good job” as Fabius said... Remember the intervention in Libya that took a large part in the migratory invasion... Remember, don’t have the short memory!
2322	11	Would you like Saddam Hussein or Mouammar Gaddafi? Look at what their countries are today: instability, corruption, civil war, unemployment, misery and famine, just like the former Lebanon “Middle East Switzerland.” Do you like Vladimir Putin? Did you not like the way he was getting rid of the opportunists who were on the way to be richer than the Russian state and thus to install globalization in Russia? But do you think it is normal that families can borrow money to the states, and that you are talking about democracy while money is the “nerve of war”? For example, let’s quote the Windsor, Morgan, Koch, Rothschild... As Napoleon said, “the hand that gives is above the hand that receives. Don’t be naive and look at the history of France: Louis XIV neutralized his superintendent of finance Nicolas Fouquet because his fortune threatened to compete with that of the royal state. The case of the castle of Vaux-le-Vicomte was not just to make a shadow to the King-Sun, he saw much further. Philip the Bel had eliminated the Templiers because they were a major financial (and military) force than that of the Kingdom of France. Whatever you think of all these historical or current characters, the principle is the same, you should not allow individuals or communities to be stronger than the States. Otherwise it is no longer the common good but the individual or minority interests that prevail.
2322	13	Today, the globalist and apatrid society project that is the “New World Order” developed in Davos is in bankruptcy, its immeasurable claim has reached the same limits as the USSR. To find an alternative to this bankruptcy, the alleged covid pandemic was tried. But that is not enough. Then we are trying to trigger a war aimed at gathering the living forces of the nations for a destructive confrontation. Many dictators have already used this method. Remember Videla leading Argentina into the Malouines war to save his regime in defeat. This is the same thing today, but on a global scale. Only the people and the lucid and patriot nations will survive. Currently, the leaders of the Western countries are multiplying the “sanktions” against Russia with the main effect of destroying their own economies, and then you will be told that it is “the fault of Putin.” You are told that the Russian people do not access the information of the Western media by forgetting to remind that the opposite has existed in us since the beginning of the war. Everything is manipulation so that you are ready to accept the unacceptable thinking to save democracy, human rights and other beautiful ideas. The media glorify the Ukrainian patriots, but for them a French patriot is a “extreme right faco.” And if you believe that “global warming” is caused by humans, say well that if the war comes to us, that it becomes global, then it will really warm very strongly!
2322	15	Time is no longer struggles of people, supportive conflicts, enemies or small personal interests. If you abstain, whether you vote white or no, you will vote for Macron as he is in a majority position. If you vote for him, you will act against humanity. Whatever you do next Sunday, historic date on April 24, 2022, you will vote for peace or war.
2327	1	Emergency Warning Vaccine
2327	3	The massive vaccination of the human population transforms the people vaccinated into “super-such” factories that produce mutant and deadly coronavirus spheres that are likely to devastate mankind.
2327	5	A prominent vaccine specialist (Dr. Bossche) warns that mass vaccinations could create a “most impossible to stop” and that mass vaccinations during the pandemic could transform the relatively harmless coronavirus we saw for the first time (SARS-cov-2) into a deadly “biological weapon”.
2327	7	The current vaccine, in turn, is not only about to be completely obsolete because the viral immunity is rapidly achieved; it also permanently alters the innate immune response to future coronavirus variants, leaving vaccinated people completely vulnerable and undefense against exposure to coronavirus mutant variants.
2327	9	The net result is the very real possibility of a global event of mass death that could potentially kill hundreds of millions of people and break the global economies, governments and nations as a whole.
2327	11	However, the vaccine industry, obstinated, arrogant and criminal, and its media propagandists aggressively demand vaccines for all, without worrying about the massive death they risk to trigger for themselves and for others.
2328	1	“Extreme right-wing anti-Semit”: Warsaw calls on France’s ambassador after Macron’s statements on Polish Prime Minister
2328	3	Emmanuel Macron held these statements in Le Parisien in response to the criticism of Mateusz Morawiecki on his telephone interviews with Vladimir Putin.
2328	5	France’s ambassador to Poland was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday 8 April following the statements of Emmanuel Macron accusing Polish government leader of “extreme right-wing anti-Semitism,” Warsaw announced.
2328	7	"“After the statements contained in the interview of the President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron to the Parisien, the Minister (Polish, ndlr) Zbigniew Rau decided to call the Ambassador of France,” the spokesman of the Polish Foreign Ministry said on Twitter. In an interview with Le Parisien on Thursday, the French president accused Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of being ""a extremist right-wing anti-Semit, which prohibits LGBTs"", after already accusing him of ""injection in the French political campaign"", pointing out his proximity with his extremist right-wing rival to the presidential Marine Le Pen."
2328	9	“No one has negotiated with Hitler.”
2328	11	"It was a reaction of Emmanuel Macron to the statements of the head of the Polish nationalist-populist government that attacked him on Monday for these telephone conversations with Vladimir Putin. “Mr President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin, what have you achieved? We don’t debate, we don’t negotiate with criminals, criminals must be fought,” said Mateusz Morawiecki. “No one has negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot,"" the Polish Prime Minister asked, accusing some European leaders of ""trembling"" and ""wood tongue""."
2328	13	"A spokesman for the Polish government said on Friday the statements of President Macron were ""uncomprehensible"" and put them on account of ""political emotions that accompany each election campaign."" “But, at the moment, talking about the Prime Minister of the Polish government in the context of anti-Semitism is simply a lie, it has nothing to do with the facts,” said Piotr Müller. “I hope that this election campaign in France will calm a little, and then the President of France will speak differently and will really stick to historical facts,” he added."
2331	1	Information War: Polish Government Launches #StopRussiaNow
2331	3	“The #StopRussiaNow campaign is the scream of wildly killed people on the streets of their hometown. Warsaw is launching a display campaign to “wake awareness” and warn about the “war crimes” and the “genocide” that Vladimir Putin would commit in Ukraine.
2331	5	Showing campaigns in Polish and European cities
2331	7	At the start of this operation on April 23, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the slogan “StopRussiaNow” will be displayed in many Polish women – a campaign that has since spread to several European cities (especially Berlin). It has also proven since this slogan “StopRussiaNow” exists in several forms, including a few variants:
2331	9	“The #StopRussiaNow campaign is launched. The posters launched in Europe say: enough to escape the question of aid to Ukraine. It is enough to torture yourself and block real help. No rest for a tyrant and a murderer. We must stop Russia and break the wall of European indifference. »
2331	11	This initiative calls for the stop of Russian oil imports to Europe, to boycott companies working with Russia, and also proposes a bank transfer to a sub-account of the National Bank of Ukraine by advancing that “[this] donation will enable the purchase of weapons and other equipment through which Ukraine will be able to defend itself against Russia! »
2331	12	by StopRussianOil
2331	14	The issue of Russian oil takes a full place in the #StopRussiaNow operation, which calls on European citizens to press their representatives to stop the purchase of Russian crude and gas.
2331	16	Every day, Russia sells oil and gas to the world for 700 million euros. With that money, Vladimir Putin pays his bandits to rape girls before their mothers and torture sons before their fathers. Do you want those who are responsible for this situation to remain impun? »
2331	18	The site also provides a pre-written message in eight languages to be sent to political representatives:
2331	20	    “I write to ask you a very simple question. The Russians are killing Ukrainian children, women and men. Why does our government oppose the sanctions against Russia? Why did we not impose an embargo on Russian oil? Why do we continue to pay billions of euros to Putin? What have you done about this? »
2331	22	The victims of the victims
2331	24	Recalling a sad constant of war propaganda, #StopRussiaNow shows on its website the following message: 208 children have been killed in Ukraine. 386 children injured by Russian war criminals. »
2331	26	"In the ten principles of war propaganda established by Anne Morelli in her novel in 2001, this use of children can be ranked in the principle 5 (""The enemy commits atrocities, but if we do so, it is involuntary"")."
2338	1	All vaccines around the world are “Transhuman”, according to a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.
2338	3	While France under the dictatorial direction of President Macron which is the only and the only to impose in Western Europe and unconsiderably the obligatory vaccination to the French nation, aligning on the worst dictatorships, making the historical heritage of France by bringing shame on our origins without worrying about the consequences and feeding the ground of a next civil war, making the predictions of President Bashar El Assad, a future reality. President Macron has provoked the French nation for the first time in an act of unprecedented criminal madness in the history of the world.
2338	5	First of all, lying again, returning to his promises and commitments, imposing today a discriminatory vaccine passport to force vaccination. In fact, he makes all the people who do not meet his criteria, the society’s bets that will no longer be able to do anything, otherwise, to stay closed at home. The Nazis did the same with the Jews during World War II by imposing a racial passport indicating the absence of filiation with the Jews, today the passport indicates if one is vaccinated and the other step, and the vaccinated becomes the new Jew in Macron's assumed dictatorship, which has not ended to destroy our nation by its criminal actions.
2338	7	The logical follow-up of his scandalous decision is, therefore, the extension of the sanitary passport, and that, from 21 July 2021 in the places of leisure and culture. Unvaccinated children will no longer be able to participate in any activity, then it will be the turn of unvaccinated adults who will no longer be able to access the cafes, restaurants, public transportation, as well as the shopping centers in early August. Macron adds that only vaccinated and negative tested (without specification of the type of test otherwise) will be able to access it. More differentiation outside/in, so we forget again the science that has shown us that it was very rare to contaminate ourselves outside.” 
2338	9	The non-vaccinated will therefore be throwed out of society and social life, he will no longer have access to anything, his property will be confiscated, the state will steal him everything. Macron had stated that we were in war, in fact, it is the war against the life of which it is here, because he force a vaccination with vaccines that are not and are still in the study in AMM (marketing authorization) conditional and that making such a decision is completely contrary to the principle of precaution, and perfectly illegal by an individual who is a banker and who imposes on 66 million French a dangerous and unrelated medical device with the COVID-19 as a Pandemic.
2338	11	What is Macron trying to provoke by this decision? Does he really believe that all the care staff will agree to get vaccinated with a high-end protein? 
2342	1	The crisis in Ukraine does not affect Ukraine. It is about Germany.
2342	3	The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Ukraine. It is about Germany and, in particular, a pipeline that connects Germany to Russia, called North Stream 2. Washington sees this gas pipeline as a threat to its primacy in Europe and has tried to sabotage the project at any end of the field. Despite this, Nord Stream 2 has gone forward and is now fully operational and ready to be used. As soon as the German regulators have issued the final certification, gas supplies will begin. German owners and will have a reliable and cheap source of clean energy, while Russia will see its gas revenues increase significantly. This is a win-win situation for both parties.
2342	5	The establishment of the U.S. foreign policy is not pleased with this evolution. They don’t want Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas, as trade creates trust and trust leads to expansion of trade. As relations are warming, trade barriers are lifted, regulations are relieved, travel and tourism are increasing, and a new security architecture is set up.
2342	7	In a world where Germany and Russia are friends and trade partners, we no longer need U.S. military bases, weapons and expensive missile systems manufactured in the United States, nor NATO. It is also not necessary to conclude energy transactions in U.S. dollars or to store U.S. Treasury bonds to balance accounts. Transactions between trade partners can be carried out in their own currencies, which will not fail to precipitate a strong decline in the value of the dollar and a spectacular shift of economic power. This is why the Biden administration is opposed to Nord Stream 2. It’s not just a gas pipeline, but a window to the future, a future in which Europe and Asia approach in a zone of massive free trade that increases their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the United States away. The warming of relations between Germany and Russia announces the end of the “unipolar” world order that the United States has supervised over the past 75 years. A German-Russian alliance threatens to precipitate the decline of the superpower that is currently approaching the abyss. That’s why Washington is determined to do everything it can to sabotage Nord Stream 2 and keep Germany on its orbit. It is a matter of survival.
2342	9	This is where Ukraine is in the game. Ukraine is Washington’s “optional weapon” to torpile North Stream 2 and create a gap between Germany and Russia. The strategy is drawn from the first page of the U.S. Foreign Policy Manual, under the rubric: Dividing to better rule. Washington must give the impression that Russia is a threat to the security of Europe. That is the goal. They must show that Putin is a blood thirsty aggressor, with an unstable temperament, to whom one can’t trust. To this end, the media was charged to repeat again and again that “Russia plans to invade Ukraine.” What is not said is that Russia has not invaded any country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, that the United States has invaded or overturned regimes in more than 50 countries during the same period, and that the United Statesins more than 800 military bases worldwide. Nothing of this is by the media, on the contrary, the emphasis is placed on the “bad Putin” who gathered about 100,000 soldiers along the Ukrainian border, threatening to dive all Europe into a new bloody war.
2342	11	All this hysteric war propaganda is created with the intention of producing a crisis that can be used to isolate, demonize and eventually divide Russia into small units. The real target, however, is not Russia, but Germany. See this output from a Michael Hudson article on The Unz Review:
2342	13	“The only way that remains to U.S. diplomats to block European purchases is to push Russia to a military response, and then to claim that the revenge of this response defeats it over any purely national economic interest. As the deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, explained in a press point of the State Department on January 27: “If Russia invades Ukraine, in one way or another, North Stream 2 will not advance.”
2342	15	It is written black on white. The Biden team wants to “push Russia to a military response” to sabotage Nord Stream 2. This means there will be a kind of provocation intended to encourage Putin to send his troops on the other side of the border to defend ethnic Russians in the eastern part of the country. If Putin bite the hammer, the answer will be fast and severe. The media will denounce this action as a threat to Europe, while the leaders around the world will denounce Putin as the “new Hitler.” That’s Washington’s strategy in a few words, and all this setting is orchestrated with one goal: making it politically impossible for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to pass Nord Stream 2 through the final approval process.
2342	17	Given what we know of Washington’s opposition to North Stream 2, readers may wonder why, earlier this year, the Biden administration made pressure on Congress to not impose more sanctions on the project. The answer to this question is simple: the internal policy. Germany is shut down its nuclear power plants and needs natural gas to fill out its energy deficit. Furthermore, the threat of economic sanctions is a “rebound” for the Germans who see it as a sign of foreign interference. “Why do the United States interfere with our energy decisions? “The average German. “Washington should take care of its own affairs and not interfere with our.” This is exactly the answer we would expect from any reasonable person.
2342	19	This is the statement of Al Jazeera:
2342	21	“The Germans in their majority support the project, it’s only some parts of the elite and the media that are against the gas pipeline.
2342	23	“The more the United States speaks of sanctioning or criticizing the project, the more it becomes popular in the German society,” said Stefan Meister, an expert in Russia and Eastern Europe at the German Foreign Affairs Council.
2342	25	The public opinion therefore strongly supports Nord Stream 2, which helps to explain why Washington has chosen a new approach. The unfunctional sanctions, Uncle Sam has passed to Plan B: creating an external threat sufficiently significant to force Germany to block the opening of the gas pipeline. To be honest, this strategy feels desperate, but we must be impressed by Washington’s perseverance. They may be driven by 5 points in the last straight line, but they haven’t thrown the sponge yet. They will give themselves a last chance and see if they can make progress.
2342	27	On Monday, President Biden held his first joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House. The media strike that surrounded this event was simply unprecedented. Everything was orchestrated to create a “crisis atmosphere” that Biden used to press the chancellor in the sense of U.S. policy. Earlier this week, White House spokesman Jen Psaki has repeatedly stated that a “Russian invasion is imminent.” His comments were followed by State Department spokesman Nick Price, who said intelligence agencies had provided him details about a fake flag operation supported by Russia, which is expected to take place soon in eastern Ukraine. Price’ warning was followed on Sunday morning by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who said a Russian invasion could occur at any time, “even tomorrow.” This was just a few days after the Bloomberg News agency published its sensational and completely false title: “Russia invades Ukraine.”
2342	29	Can you see the scheme here? Can you see how all these unfounded statements were used to press the German Chancellor, who did not doubt anything and seemed unconscious of the campaign that targeted him?
2342	31	As we could expect, the thanksgiving was taken by the U.S. president himself. During the press conference, Biden insisted that:
2342	33	“If Russia invades, there will no longer be North Stream 2. We will end it.”
2342	35	So now, Washington decides on Germany’s policy?The?The?
2342	37	What unbearable arrogance!
2342	39	The German Chancellor was disappointed by Biden's comments, which obviously did not be part of the initial scenario. Despite this, Scholz never agreed to cancel Nord Stream 2 and even refused to mention the gas pipeline by its name. If Biden thought he could intimidate the leader of the world’s third-largest economy by hanging him in a public forum, he was wrong. Germany remains determined to launch Nord Stream 2, regardless of the potential tensions in the remote Ukraine. But that could change at any time. After all, who knows what incentives Washington could prepare in the near future? Who knows how many lives they are ready to sacrifice to create a gap between Germany and Russia? Who knows what risks Biden is ready to take to slow down the US decline and prevent the emergence of a new “policentric” world order? Everything can happen in the coming weeks. All of it.
2342	41	Germany is currently in a position of force. It is up to Scholz to decide how the case will be resolved. Will he implement the policy that best serves the interests of the German people or will he surrender to the incessant pressure of Biden? Will he pursue a new path that will strengthen new alliances in the Eurasian Corridor in full eruption or will he support Washington’s crazy geopolitical ambitions? Will he accept the central role of Germany in a new world order – in which many emerging power centers equally share the world governance and where the leaders remain indefectibly committed to multilateralism, peaceful development and security for all – or will he try to support the post-war system that has clearly exceeded its lifetime?
2342	43	One thing is certain: whatever the decision of Germany, it will affect us all.
2344	1	Climate: Consensus does not influence it
2344	3	A 19-page list contains 198 answers from supporters of anthropic climate warming (RCA), 198 answers to claims that would be those of climate skeptics. To my surprise, none of these answers mention a measure, an experiment, an observation that would present the increase in CO2 as “responsive of global warming.” We must believe, as we must believe, JP van Ypersele who, in his book, condemns CO2 without providing any evidence... 
2344	5	JP van Ypersele’s colleagues acknowledge that their idea has received as “proof” only this fact: CO2 and temperature have recently increased simultaneously. This is not the first time and this “proof” has no value... not more than the “proofs” of the 30 brilliant German physicists who, in 1930, clamed their opposition to general relativity. Einstein simply replied, “A single physicist with a mistake would be enough. “The consensus is not part of the inventory of evidence in science... So, the RCA remains unproof today and is based only on two claims: 1) heating acts through infrared radiation (IR) and 2) more CO2 makes the atmosphere warm by amplifying the IR.
2344	7	In practice, since 1909 we know the experience of Professor Robert Wood: he observes that an IR-transparent greenhouse is at the same temperature as an IR-transparent greenhouse. If the greenhouses eliminated their heat by IR, the transparent greenhouse to the IR would be less hot than the other... As the greenhouse can be as large as our atmosphere, it is clear that the IR – unlike what the RCA believers “know” – do not evacuate the earth’s heat essentially by radiation. Remember that CO2 in the atmosphere has a role for the RCA disciples only through these IRs. And as these IRs do not intervene, CO2 does not intervene either.
2344	9	Recently, I was trying to raise an experiment that directly questioned CO2 and demonstrated that radiation in the atmosphere – and CO2 in particular – does not affect the Earth’s temperature. This experiment, physicists Seim and Olsen had already done in 2020!  The transmission of radiation through the atmosphere to the soil – especially its CO2, even concentrated 2500 times – does not act on the soil temperature.
2344	11	Innocent CO2, why are the “politics leaders” continuing to predict a $100 billion spending (IMF) to save the planet from a imaginary danger?
2344	13	Let’s be realistic: these “responsible” are all incompetent in the field and their counselors avoid them any contact with useful information, as the media avoid it with us. The “influencers” know where the taxpayer’s money should go. So, ask Mrs. Marghem, a lawyer, former Belgian Energy Minister, a question like “what is the kWh? Have fun with his answer.
2344	15	The situation seems hopeless. We will accept the ruin “to save Gaia.” To those who would like to be “influencers” after scientific experiment, I propose to reproduce the 2 experiments raised for €100 each and which, each, put an end to the RCA theory.
2353	1	Don’t be afraid of Ukrainian refugees.
2353	3	Ukrainian refugees are beginning to flow to Poland and Romania, and some are already crisping in the face of this “recrudescence of immigration.”
2353	5	I am exaggerated by the demagogical statements of some presidential candidates on this topic.
2353	7	I will therefore answer them brutally: Beyond the human drama representing the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, this arrival of refugees would be highly beneficial for Europe, and especially for France.
2353	9	Unfortunately, it would at the same time be a gift for Russia and a disaster for Ukraine.
2353	11	Demographic and Historical Remembrance
2353	13	Let’s remember the main demographic data of the countries concerned: in 2021, the European Union had 446 million inhabitants, without the UK’s population, following the Brexit. 45 million Ukrainians and 146 million Russians.
2353	15	These three sets are in demographic decline, they know and care about it. Russia for geopolitical reasons, the other countries of the European Union, and in particular Germany or Italy, due to accelerated aging and a lack of workforce that becomes acute.
2353	17	There is already a significant Ukrainian immigration in the European Union. According to the recruitment agency Manpower in an article from the newspaper Le Monde:
2353	19	    It is estimated that there are already 500,000 Ukrainians working in the Czech Republic, counting those not declared, or 10% of the active population.
2353	21	There are probably many others in Poland and Romania.
2353	23	We should also remember that Western Ukraine has long been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Poland, and is therefore culturally closer to Europe than to Russia. What takes away from the weight of the Russian statement, “Ukraine is at the heart of our history,” is completely false for a large part of the country.
2353	25	This is reinforced by the fact that in 2018 a part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church passed under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople at the expense of the Moscow, inheriting the branch that has been for centuries linked to Rome.
2353	27	In 2019, more than 60 percent of Ukrainians declaring themselves Orthodox claimed to belong to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
2353	29	This European tropism of western Ukraine, however, was initiated by Stalinism that returned from this region the Germans, and especially the Poles, while the Nazis had already exterminated the Jewish population.
2353	31	If we add to this the communist persecution against the western elites, we might think that this western part of Ukraine has de-westernized.
2353	33	But it is only partial as the election results and linguistic distribution show: if the Ukrainians massively voted for independence in 1991, and in all regions of the country, it is in the West that the vote for the yes was most marked, while the Russian language is, on the contrary, more present in the east and especially in the Donbass region, even if the Russian-speaking does not mean Russian-speaking... the President Zelensky is also Russian-speaking.
2353	35	The French situation
2353	37	The presidential election campaign sees the issue of immigration mixed with the issue of identity and security. This results in a global (in my opinion excessive) rejection of immigration in general.
2353	39	Let’s be honest and direct: this rejection of immigration is mainly targeted to Africans and Muslims, two categories that are widely divided. It is forgotten that a significant part of these Muslims escape the religious restrictions of their country, and that millions of descendants of Muslims are no longer believers.
2353	41	We also forget the advantage that we have compared to other European countries of seeing immigrants arriving, the majority of whom speak and write French.
2353	43	This is a unique case in Europe: ask our neighbors in Outer Rhine if the Syrians and even the Italians or the Kosovoans they have received so broadly spoke German!
2353	45	In any case, the Ukrainians are Christians and nothing physically distinguishes them from the other Europeans. They are not French speakers.
2353	47	In the opposite sense, these same Frenchmen demand employment in their respective professions: in the EHPADs, to take an example of news, in teachers, judges or even police officers.
2353	49	The active population of France is just a little more than 30 million people (including the 3 million unemployed, many of which are not available), which is little for about 68 million inhabitants.
2353	51	The use of immigration to fill this workforce deficit is therefore all in our advantage and the lack of qualifications for some of the migrants does not necessarily constitute an obstacle if we think, for example, of the aid professions to persons or newborns.
2353	53	Today, the private and public services sector represents the first sector to recruit in France with 38% of the total employment intentions.
2353	55	It remains to welcome them effectively and decently and to allow them to work quickly, which, in France, is often not the case.
2353	57	The first contacts are important. However, with its slowness, the French administration is demotivating, which leads the populations concerned to black labour, traffic, and chapping.
2353	59	Let’s not go back to our 2004 mistake: when Poland entered the European Union, some countries, including Britain, immediately accepted Polish immigrants while France made a transitional period. As a result, they went to the UK where they were very active. Brexit, which was partially directed against them, has made a lot of it go away and their absence is now regrettable.
2353	61	As for the current situation in Ukraine, France seems to want to take part in the reception of refugees, as the President of the Republic said at the EU summit in Brussels on February 25.
2353	63	In 2021, more than 2,100 Ukrainians requested asylum in France, a modest proportion of the 103,000 applications received by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Apatrides (Ofpra). But already last year, some of these requests were based on the security situation in the Donbass.
2353	65	France already has 110,000 accommodation available and 200,000 emergency accommodation available. In addition, the state could also recycle buildings where schools to accommodate refugees if necessary.
2353	67	It remains that, in my opinion, one of the solutions to welcome these new migrants and allow them to quickly access the employment market would be to take the example of Germany and to appeal to the association sector, religious, as well as to.
2353	69	Even though I am not sure that these French actors have the same spirit of initiative and devotion as their German counterparts, it should be tried to motivate them by an information campaign and also by a financial support.
2353	71	It can be thought of a degressive subsidy granted to companies that would immediately hire them or even give them access to the status of a student.
2353	73	Therefore, a massive arrival of Ukrainian refugees would be a blessing for France, opinion partly shared by the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission at the National Assembly, Jean-Louis Bourlanges.
2356	1	Green Capitalism: Another Enterprise Trap
2356	3	If the business leaders and finance leaders were serious, they would recognize the need to radically change the direction to ensure that this planet remains a hospital for all humanity, today and in the future.
2356	5	Waves of heat, floods, droughts and forest fires destroy communities around the world, and their severity will only increase.
2356	7	If the negators of climate change remain powerful, the need for urgent action is now recognized far beyond the circles of activists.
2356	9	Governments, international organizations, and even the world of business and finance are clinging to the inevitable – at least that’s what it seems.
2356	11	In fact, the world has lost decades to blurry carbon emission exchange and “green” financial labelling systems, and the current vocation is simply to design fantastic coverage strategies (“carbon compensation”) to neglect the simple fact that mankind is sitting in the same boat.
2356	12	The “compensation” can serve individual asset holders, but it will not do much to avoid the climate disaster that awaits us all.
2356	13	The private sector’s adoption of “green capitalism” seems to be a new trick to avoid real accounting.
2356	15	If the leaders of the world of business and finance were serious, they would recognize the need to radically change the direction to make this planet stay hospital for all humanity, today and in the future.
2356	17	It is not about replacing brown assets with green assets, but to share the losses that brown capitalism has imposed on millions of people and to guarantee a future even to the most vulnerable.
2356	19	The concept of green capitalism implies that the costs of fighting climate change are too high for governments to assume them alone, and that the private sector has always better responses.
2356	21	Thus, for the supporters of green capitalism, public-private partnership will guarantee that the transition from brown capitalism to green capitalism will be cost-neutral. Investing in new technologies at a reasonable price will prevent humanity from falling into the fall.
2356	22	But it seems too nice to be true, because that’s the case.
2356	24	The DNA of capitalism makes it unable to face the effects of climate change, which is largely the product of capitalism itself. The whole capitalist system is based on the privatization of gains and the socialization of losses – not in a disgrace, but with the blessing of the law.
2356	26	    The law offers licenses to externalize the costs of spoliating the planet to anyone who is smart enough to establish a trust or corporate entity before generating pollution.
2356	28	It encourages the discharge of environmental responsibilities accumulated through restructuring in case of bankruptcy. And it holds whole countries as hostages of international rules that prefer the protection of foreign investors’ returns to the detriment of the well-being of their own population.
2356	30	Several countries have already been prosecuted by foreign companies under the Energy Charter for attempting to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions.
2356	32	    Two-thirds of the total emissions since the industrial revolution came from only 90 companies. 
2356	34	However, even if the leaders of the world’s worst polluters were willing to continue rapid decarbonization, their shareholders would resist.
2356	36	For decades, the gospel of maximizing value for shareholders has ruled as master, and leaders know that if they get away from the Orthodoxy, they will be prosecuted for having violated their trust obligations.
2356	38	It is not surprising that big companies and big finance today advise the disclosure of climate information as a way to get out of it. The message is that it is the shareholders, not the leaders, who must trigger the necessary behavior change – solutions must be found through the price mechanism, not by science-based policies.
2356	40	    The question of why investors, who have a easy output option and numerous coverage options, should be concerned about the disclosure of future damages caused to some companies in their portfolio remains unanswered.
2356	42	It is obvious that more radical changes are needed, such as carbon taxes, permanent moratoriums on natural resources extraction, etc. These policies are often rejected as mechanisms that would false markets, and yet they idealize markets that do not exist in the real world.
2356	44	After all, governments have generously subsidized the fossil fuels industry for decades, spending $5.500 billion (pre and after taxes), or 6.8% of the global GDP, in 2017. And if fossil fuels miss profits to compensate for these tax relief, they can simply sell themselves to a more profitable company, thus rewarding their shareholders for their loyalty.
2356	46	The scenario of these strategies has long been written in the fusion and acquisition law.
2356	48	But the mother of all subsidies is the secular process of legal encoding of capital through property, corporate, trust and bankruptcy law. It is the law, and not the markets or, that protects the owners of equipment goods even when they make them weigh on others of enormous responsibilities.
2356	50	The defenders of green capitalism hope to continue this game. That’s why they now press the governments to subsidize asset replacement, so as the price of green assets decreases, the price of green assets rises to compensate the owners of assets.
2356	52	    Again, that is capitalism. When it comes to whether this is the best strategy to ensure the planet’s habitat, it’s a completely different question.
2356	54	Instead of addressing these issues, governments and regulators have once again succeeded in the sirenes of market-friendly mechanisms.
2356	56	The new consensus focuses on financial disclosure, as this path promises a change without having to realize it. (It is also found that it generates jobs for whole industries of accountants, lawyers and business consultants, who themselves have powerful pressure groups).
2356	57	It is not surprising that the result has been a wave of ecoblanching. The financial industry has joyfully paid thousands of billions of dollars in green-labeled assets that have proved not to be green at all.
2356	59	According to a recent study, 71% of ESG funds (censed to reflect environmental, social or governance criteria) are contrary to the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement.
2356	61	We lack time for such experiences. If the ecologization of the economy was really the target, the first step would be to eliminate all direct subsidies and tax aid to brown capitalism and to impose the stop of the “proliferation” of carbon.
2356	62	Governments should also decree a moratorium on the protection of pollutants, their owners and investors from any responsibility for environmental damage.
2356	64	Incidentally, these measures would also allow to eliminate some of the worst distortions in the market.
2357	1	Marine votes to end Macron’s vaccine policy
2357	3	Enjoy the introduction of Pierre de decoderleco that decoded for us international statistics. And if you still vote for our national banker, it’s that you’re badly informed, victim of propaganda or vaccinated, tired, tired, and even more as suggested by a comment of an internet user “the injected are even more fanatic, because the way of psychic protection must be extremely strong (because they know they have the product in them, admit that the product is dangerous, it’s making the mind crazy who has that thought). »
2357	5	He is right, and we return to this existential question from the beginning of the covidist era: how to get out of a sect.
2357	7	The very relevant analysis of Ariane Bilheran unfortunately does not give us the solution. We have fallen into an eugenic and hygienic totalitarism and the involuntary or militant collabos believe themselves liable to the one who would have “protected” them by his vax and pass.
2357	9	To get out of it, only – – the repetition of the truth by articles, videos, conversations, on the inefficiency and risks, the proven dangers of pass and pseudo vax” and the increasingly frequent observation of post vax accidents in its relationships, will make the fault allowing the listening and taking seriously of the side effects that shake the lives of many women[2] [3] and of all humans subject to the many side effects, heart, neurological without mentioning this immense unexplicated fatigue that many injected feel.
2357	11	It can also be imagined that Eric Zemmour, but also Pécresse and others’ greatest “feil” was not to talk about the impact of the covidist crisis on the French, to underestimate it in the final choice of their voting bulletin.  It is necessary and even indispensable that Marine does not make the same mistake, especially as only 2% appears to separate it from its rival. If she wants to hear us...
2357	13	It should be noted that many potential voters of Z have finally decided to vote for Marine because she has clearly said in the last days that she will definitively remove the vaccine pass and the mandatory vax and reintroduce suspended nurses. Many testimony prove this.
2357	15	When people have taken the risk of injecting an experimental substance (at unknown risks), and more of making their children kick, just to go on vacation or to the restaurant, it is that the concept of “corruption” is not reserved for the elites, nor for direct money, but for a “western” life conditioning for decades that is not deleted in a few months. Corrupted by the easy life and the apparent charity of the providence state...
2357	17	It should not be underestimated the predominant part in the heads of the voters of this covid and its current pseudo dangers, and its consequences on their choice of vote, which is still witnessed by the still too widespread wear of the mask yet – not only useless but dangerous – at the present time.
2357	19	Almost everywhere the covid has disappeared and effective treatments have proved in Algeria, India and Ecuadorian Africa.
2357	21	But the media and the false physicians of the TV plates have spread their poison. While waiting for them to pay, it’s the naïfs who get picked and vote for the enemy of the yellow jackets.[ 4 ]
2357	23	Covidists fear to die now, then the great replacement, and even the retirement age, the SMIG, the future of children and France, and even the purchasing power, is no longer their problem. And yet they vote... They had to speak their language, think about it to find the words so well found for the rest.
2357	25	The vax would not be forbidden to them and other people are not dangerous, etc... We would continue to protect them... Some are still afraid of bise during meetings on the street or at the office. We need to hear them and talk to them. And don’t sing “talk to me about something else”, but rather how your friends and neighbors go and try to analyze with them the menstrual loss of young girls or the heart attacks that have become really common among young athletes...
2358	1	For a racial approach to immigration
2358	3	Everywhere in the media are celebrated all these exotic peoples and their respective specificities.
2358	4	It is angry that in China giant movements of Han people come to submerge these brave Uighur Muslims, equipped with all the virtues.
2358	5	As for Africa, it is a good tone to fall in worship before these multitudes of ethnicities, each with its language, customs, religion. Everyone needs to be respected and protected.
2358	6	As for the indigenous of Amazon, they are simply gods.
2358	8	All of these people are characterized by a approach to society that is ethnic (which can even be called microethnic for some, so much they are fragmented), tribal and even clanic for many of them.
2358	9	Anyone who would even dare to insine from close or far that many of these tribes resemble two drops of water, would immediately be excommunicated by the left, taxed by racist and xenophobic.
2358	11	These ethno-tribalo-clanical social structures have existed for thousands of years and must be respected, promoted and sanctified. They incarn the Homo sapiens in all its original purity and, in addition, allow university teachers to have a job and students to do theses instead of pointing to the Employment Pole.
2358	13	These people rarely have an identity document. They don’t need it, they recognize each other with a simple glance. From a simple look, a Utu knows whether he must cut a Tutsi on the machette or greet one of his brothers. Even in racially homogeneous countries such as China, ethnic differences are obvious to everyone.
2358	15	The Africans and the Maghrebs present on our territory categorize humans into four categories: the White, the Chinese, the Arabs and the Black. This distinction is obvious to them, and no one would have the safe idea to question it. Within their respective communities, the Black and the Maghrebs are equally naturally subdivided into nationalities, tribes, native villages. All this is perfectly normal in their eyes.
2358	17	In Europe, a few hours of flight from France, there is a country artificially created by the United Nations, the United States and the EU, which is called Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many forgot it, but this golem was born on the corpse of former Yugoslavia in 1992. Sick spirits wanted to play with the learned witch by forcing three ethnicities (Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosnians) to share one territory. A quick review of the card shows the level of dementia of these two-sons dementia.
2358	19	This pseudo-land is no more than a protectorate, with a kind of governor appointed by the United Nations, under the control of the EUFOR, a European military force of about 14,000 soldiers.
2358	20	Thirty years after its creation, this monster is a failure. Secessionist currents are stronger than ever, and interethnic antagonisms to their paroxysm. The most integristic versions of Islam are prospering there, and the entire journalistic mafia continues to silence the fact that terrorist training camps pull on the territory.
2358	22	Innerable Jean Quatremer, yet sold body and soul to Europe, said on Arte that this project was devoted to failure because it cannot force people who do not want it to live together.
2358	23	If Jean Quatremer, a leftist, Europeanist and immigrant, is forced to admit, he who once treated all the French people who had dared to vote against the Maastricht Treaty, we can believe it by word.
2358	25	Quatremer clearly explains that it is nevertheless unthinkable to make three white ethnic groups, which all speak more or less the Serbo-Croatian and of which two are Christians, cohabitate in the same country!
2358	26	All this is indisputable. It is necessary to take into account all the specificities and desires of these populations.
2358	28	Uigours, Bantus, Peuls, Aborigines of Australia, Utus, Tutsis, Serbs, Croats, Kosovars, Berbers, are recognized to all the right to affirm their ethnic and/or racial specificities, to make them valid and even to be proud of them.
2358	30	What is celebrated for the peoples of the whole world is denied to the French.
2358	31	No one asks us for our opinion. Our own President, the Egyptologist of Eliseo, explains us that there is no French people, that French culture is a historic myth. There is no more “we”. The French is an ectoplasm that has the vocation only to dissolve in silence in those peoples that come to invade our territory. Dissolve yes, but not too much yet, in order to continue paying the taxes that will serve to give the newcomers.
2360	1	Emmanuel Macron announces vaccine passing becomes mandatory for access to vaccine centres
2360	3	In his interview with the Parisien, Emmanuel Macron announced that he intended to “melt” the non-vaccinated. At our micro, he continued his reasoning: “To really well embrace the non-vaccinated, I decided to make the vaccine pass mandatory to access the vaccine centers.” Thus, more than life, the President of the Republic will make vaccination impossible for non-vaccinated. 
2360	5	“And to make sure that no irresponsible person approaches a vaccine center, I will put there at the entrance two MMA fighters, each armed with a tass and a hungry dog. The dog is not vaccinated. Because they want natural medicine they will go to cure anger with granules with colza oil! “Emmanuel Macron said before he took a laugh that made the windows around us tremble.
2360	7	Under the glass of the Elysée, the President no longer stops and shouts: “It’s all they deserve these alcoholic and conspiracy refractors! If the French had spent as much time in school as in the PMU, we would live in an Enarchic country, I tell you! Because that’s where they hide the non-vaccinated, in dirty roads, on the clinging ground, looking at the quintet! From January 15th, it is over. I will make life impossible. He ended, fixing us, the eyes shrinked, suddenly throwing us a syringe in the arm: “Have it, it’s gifts, it’s your fourth dose in the premiere! »
2363	1	Vladimir Putin sends his army to the center of the Earth to “destruction the lava”
2363	3	In a television speech addressed to the Russian people, Vladimir Putin announced that he had sent troops to the center of the Earth in order to “release the inner ground core of Nazism. »
2363	5	“My parents have fought against the German Nazis, and I will fight against the hot-point volcanism,” the President of the Russian Federation said this afternoon before taking a judo on the Earth’s globe placed on his office.
2363	7	“This lava rack – what I say, this neonazi lava rack – must be removed from the geological power as soon as possible in order to facilitate the movement of our dear Eurasian tectonic plaque,” the dictator continued saying he is looking forward to capturing the asthenosphere of the planet “to release iron, nickel and other minerals that are under the fascist yog. »
2363	9	According to French intelligence services, Russian soldiers would have already begun to penetrate the earth’s crown, and they are afraid that if the lava doesn’t go, the Russians will use boiling machines that vibrate so strongly that it shakes.
2363	11	“The Russian president has always had a particular hatred to all kinds of geological layers, so I’t be surprised that he goes to attack the central core of the Earth,” says Anne-Sophie Krafft, a French geologist.  
2363	13	According to European military sources, thousands of Russian soldiers would have been instantly disintegrated when they arrived in the core. It is currently unclear whether they were attacked by molotov cocktails, or simply by the natural heat of 6000°C. 
2374	1	Authority in all its forms
2374	3	A major economic crisis, partly linked to the catastrophic choices of the pandemic, is profounded by inflation, energy rationalization, jacqueries, and even an international conflict. Covid, in all this, does not weigh anything.
2374	5	The time is to the certified panic, to the “science” labelled pythies and to the random predictions raised to the ranges of truths... Health, demography, climate, as he feared to help, man has submitted himself to technology, as he did, antan, to the Divine Creator. The all-trained future, he, is hard to conform to the modeling... Our miracles of leaders have swallowed into the gap: to foundation their decisions on a scientifically validated future is the provision.
2374	7	the ignorant? No doubt, but above all opportunists. They have their chicken trips 2.0, their deep learning mark of coffee. It remains to sort in the mass of forecasts in order to retain the one that serves their cause. By the way, everyone forgets or feels to forget that error is part of the evolutionary process of science but it is not a matter of falling down to any scepticism, that scepticism that led Einstein to revolutionize physics: politics does not know the subtility.
2374	9	Previously, God recognised everything here down but these times have passed: Nietzsche announced it to us 150 years ago, without a moment of doubt that new religions would replace their elders. Scientism killed Catholicism and we lost spirituality and eternal life in the past. We still laugh at Denys the Little and the Millennials, but do we really do better?
2374	11	The God of Science warned us in November 2020. We were about 400,000 dead. The president has broadcast the information and no one has really broken so we give it, more discreetly: hear, hear, the epidemic will start again. Do you not believe it? You doubt the science. You are a misleading obscurantist. I am exercising in a covid center. I keep up the data on dedicated professional sites every day. The disease exists and it has gone. She killed, essentially, in the population of very old and very tired men and, marginally, among the youngest, which distinguishes her from seasonal flu.
2374	13	The death rate is ranked in the 1957 (Asian influenza) and 1969 (Hong Kong influenza) pandemies. These would have caused 4 million victims but remember that then, for example among others, China and the USSR communicated in their own way... The countings have probably evolved for half a century. So, look at comparisons, or even worse, as I read on a Mediapart article supposedly criticizing the work of epidemiologist Laurent Toubiana, look at comparisons of real data with estimates from simulations. Again and always they.
2374	15	Without sharing the whole of his moderate and widely argued positions, as my colleague I think the drawn picture is not in harmony with reality. I remain convinced, considering the crispations and the nature of the vaccine itself, that it should have been reserved for the risky populations. I remind that some prodiges (I include the President who made us generations of refractors, with his claimed desire to embrace them) brought a serious blow to the vaccine cause, to which I am attached.
2374	17	The cause of the health panic, the PCR, which caused a phenomenal financial gap. Externality, through, according to our criteria of tax ignorants but does the unconsidered expenditure only have an influence on the technocratic decision? The state commands plastrone even more ostensibly that they engulf billions of abyssal debts. They only know how to use with reason what the payer pig gets in exchange for his sweat. Sweating is enough.
2374	19	To act reasonably exceeds his abilities so the technocrate has the magnanimity to charge the part of expenditure. In addition to these enthusiastic waste, the basic enarch was able, thanks to the PCR, to swallow on the various plates: it aligned the index and the neologisms, the incidence rates, the positivity rates and all of these data to the controversial values. The percentage is the essential part of the contemporary political discourse. Tax, immigration, health, security, there’s only that. The figures of the covid have therefore made it possible to disturb the beotians and gently lead them to panic...
2374	21	At the beginning of the pandemic, everyone was just destabilized and everything would be calmed but the governors, unfortunately, took the situation in charge. All the usual weapons of their arsenal were gathered so how to resist? They delimited the borders, designated the clans and they were able to divide, manipulate, push to the confrontation, distinguishing friends from enemies, the brave scared from the obscurantist ignorants...
2374	23	The epidemic was going to destroy us, the services would be immersed, and the bodies would be overwhelmed unless... we submit to their orders. If we were down to pay attention to these obscurantists down the roof of antivax complotists, it would be hell then some followed. What has worked once doesn’t need to be renewed. We’ll see: it’s undoubted that it tosses and trembles in the shells in the last days. The reanimations, the only criterion I keep in mind, are completely deserted (with regard to the covid, of course). There is a 15-day gap, so patience.
2374	25	I have difficulty acknowledging that in the absence of cases, deaths, famous or not, real sick, the population surrenders to this panic that benefits all those who feed on the back of the beast, authorities, media, plato doctors, PCR manufacturers, work stop lovers, state financial aid... Two camps are confronted: the bets are open.
2377	1	Emmanuel Macron will meet with climate warming to ask him to stop his aggression immediately
2377	3	The President once again wants to prioritize diplomacy to resolve the current crisis.
2377	5	The failure of negotiations to avoid the conflict in Ukraine has not altered Emmanuel Macron’s faith; it is through the voice of the dialogue that the head of state hopes to resolve the new crisis that strikes Europe,” we will do everything to avoid an open war against climate warfare. We need to avoid a decline that would directly affect the portfolio of the most fragile CAC 40 companies,” he said in a press release.
2377	7	The French president knows that he is walking on eggs and that he will not be able to use a too vindicative tone during negotiations,” he said. Peace will not be constructed like that. “The president has martyrized his European counterparts.
2377	9	Of course, the leader of the Republic in March reminded that he condemns with the greatest firmness these repeated attacks, including the heat wave that has hit the whole world since mid-June. Condemnations that don’t seem to intimidate the global warming that, since its overprotected palace, reaffirmed that it was well determined “to denial the earth of mankind”.
2379	1	A monstrous plastic mountain is announced by 2060
2379	3	The volume of plastic will triple by 2060 in terms of use and waste. This is what the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD)’s new report on “Global Plastic Perspectives – Scenarios d’action à l’horizon 2060” (Global Plastic Perspectives – Scenarios d’action à l’horizon 2060) published on Friday, June 3. The global plastic consumption is expected to rise from 460 million tons (Mt) in 2019 to 1,231 Mt in 2060, while the volume of plastic waste is expected to rise from 353 (Mt) in 2019 to 1,014 Mt in 2060.
2379	5	The packaging is largely responsible for this. If they are not discharged (which will affect 507 Mt of waste in 2060 if the trend isined), burned (for 179 Mt in 2060) or recycled (for 302 Mt in 2060), these waste are most often found in nature (for 153 Mt in 2060). As a result, annual plastic emissions in the environment are expected to almost double, moving on average from 22 Mt in 2019 to 44 Mt in 2060. Plastic stocks accumulated in the world’s rivers and oceans are expected to rise from 140 Mt in 2019 to 493 Mt in 2060, a three-fold multiplication.
2379	7	Whether for macroplastics (more than 5 millimeters) or for microplastics (less than 5 millimeters), the environmental consequences of this mass pollution are significant. Animals are embedded in or often ingest plastic waste, leading to serious injuries and even death, according to a WWF report in 2018. But human health is also increasingly affected: decomposed plastic particles can end in our organs and disturb their functioning in the long run.
2385	1	“Geopolitics Changes”: Expert Delyagin Predicts a New Scenario of World Order
2385	3	The balance of geopolitical forces changes actively, as a result, political blocks transform their own roles and relations with each other. If before the EU member countries for the Russian Federation were the main “Supplier” of innovation, today they have become a source of “real madness” — in an interview with the publication “Economy Today,” said the Russian politician and economist Mikhail Delyagin.
2385	5	The progressive deterioration of the relations between Russia and the EU countries, caused by the latter’s refusal to make decisions by themselves, without the U.S. supervision, has reached a critical point with the beginning of a special military operation, forced to deploy the Kremlin on the territory that has become extremely dangerous, Ukraine.
2385	7	The large-scale punitive measures of economic restrictions against Russia included six large-scale sanctions packages, which had an extremely negative impact, first and foremost, on the economies of the EU countries themselves, moving rapidly toward recession.
2385	9	    “At present, there is an acute internal crisis in the EU countries. The countries of the modern Western system have grown a hole for themselves, causing an energy and food crisis, causing massive flows of migrants, the consequences of which are known,” the expert says.
2385	11	According to the expert, the social crisis caused by a major problem with migrants will be another serious catalyst of the imminent collapse of Europe. Then the United States will follow, where an obvious election crisis, caused by the failure of Biden’s policy and the rapid fall of its support level, adds to a large number of problems.
2385	13	Under the conditions where the countries of the Western system will desperately try to fight against the above problems, Russia will be able to profit advantageously of the opportunity to strengthen its own authority position under the conditions of a new arrangement of geopolitical forces.
2385	15	    “We are witnessing an absolute change in the economic development vector. The old economic system is obsolete — it was developed 3 centuries ago by financial speculators, in general, it is a field of exchange of various types of goods. Basically, the attention is given to the tools of reproduction of material goods for each person personally-now each will be for himself,” – estimates Delyagin.
2385	17	Remember that a number of Western countries have imposed large-scale anti-Russian economic restrictions that, contrary to the authors’ expectations, have proved unable to make a significant blow to the Russian economy.
2386	1	Moldova is at risk of losing its independence due to West’s joints – former President Dodon
2386	3	The EU’s external course shows the exuberant rise of rusophobic feelings and geopolitical hystery. Today, a big challenge is launched by Europe and traditional values — such a statement on the vast social networks published the former leader of Moldova Igor Dodon.
2386	5	The sensational candidacy of Ukraine to the European Union, according to the politician, was a “low-cost gift” granted to “Nezalezhnaya” [Ukraine’s independent] with one purpose: to deeply attract Kiev in insidious geopolitical productions under the intelligent leadership of the elites of Western Europe. And Ukraine in this scenario will be attributed to its own non-representative role.
2386	7	    “In fact, we have become candidates for new political and military experiences, according to the sad example of Ukraine. And the precipitation with which we took the candidates, as well as Ukraine, in the absence of reforms and a political regime of the party in power, becoming dictatorial and rough violating the foundations of the rule of law and the fundamental freedoms of citizens, confirmed that Moldova will play the role of a pioneer on the geopolitical square of the West,” – quotes RuBaltic.Ru.
2386	9	At the same time, the thirst of Chisinau to become an active participant of the great Western game, will turn to the country of the consequences of a catastrophic scale, warns Dodon.
2386	11	    “Because of the Russian-phobic policy conducted jointly with the West, we will not only lose profitable economic relations with our Eastern partners, but we also risk to remain without a part of our territories. As a result, Moldova as an independent state can disappear,” the former leader said.
2386	13	Myope, and extremely dangerous, the current course of the Moldavian authorities is built on aggressive and irresponsible bases, which in the near future will hit the country’s innocent population, — said the former president.
2386	15	    “The statements of the country’s leaders that the candidate status for EU membership forces Moldova to join the anti-Russian sanctions are lies. For example, Turkey, a member of NATO, which obtained the candidate status several decades ago, refused to support Western sanctions against Russia because they are contrary to national interests. The war of the West with Russia is not our war,” the politician said.
2386	17	The Moldavian authorities have forgotten the need for neutrality and the fundamental principles of sovereignty for a state that respects itself: the political course of Chisinau, according to Dodon, should be based solely on taking into account its own national interests, which are based on a mutually beneficial dialogue with the West and the East.
2386	19	Previously, Dodon had declared Moldova’s extremely catastrophic state, noting that the country was hardly in balance at the edge of the global social, economic and energy crisis.
2386	21	Let’s note, according to the experts, today, the Republic desperately tries to “manage the two worlds,” being in a very disadvantage position, with a lot of difficulty and fear of choosing another political line of conduct.
