331	1	Energy Crisis: the executive puts a layer of transition to the none
331	3	The energy outlook for the coming months is not good. The crisis that now affects the whole of Europe is declared severe and if, unfortunately, the winter is severe, the peoples will have the opportunity to measure exactly what intermitting means for green energy.
331	5	Clearly, the solutions implemented so far to compensate for the cessation of the distribution of Russian gas and oil show weaknesses and clearly raise the concerns of citizens. However, with more than 20 degrees of average in France today, it’s still too early to worry and the government knows, again, how to proceed. As often in Socialism, if what we’ve done doesn’t work, it’s because it’s only for one strong reason: we’ve not been far enough or strong enough.
331	7	The ecological planning continues so much better, reinforced by the latest decisions of an executive completely out of the ground and determined to do absolutely everything to the stupid objectives set by the Agenda 2030, leaves to dissolve the people in the operation if this showed itself a little too coriace.
331	9	This is how we learn that Emmanuel Macron decided, alone as a great one, to withdraw France from the Treaty on the Energy Charter signed in 1994.
331	11	Arguing of the fact that this exit would have been “requested by many” (many being the now official measurement unit of democracy, much more accurate and effective than a referendum or the painful use of a National Assembly which has also been seen recently all the emptiness), the head of state will thus withdraw France from the agreements of this treaty which essentially aimed to offer certain guarantees to companies making expensive investments in different energy fields, including high-cost fossil energies in capital, in order to avoid the bad surprises linked to states directly against their interests.
331	13	Excellent opportunity for this country to discover what additional legal insecurity can cause in the short, medium and long term especially in the field of energy and in particular the fossil energy, the one where, precisely, the investments, in addition to expensive, are the most problematic in France and where the delay accumulated in the last decades already begins to cause some concerns: in 2013, De Margerie, then patron of Total, explained to whom he wanted to hear that oil companies, its first, would be forced to close refineries so the green policies pushed their operations to the wall.
331	15	Nearly 10 years later, France finds itself in a very delicate situation (it imports more and more refined diesel abroad) to which strikes add a little smelled perfume and it’s wrong to see how the last unilateral decision of Eliseo’s rental will improve the situation.
331	17	Along with these catastrophic decisions of a chief of state determined to ruin the French industries, the whole government also works to add its foot to the ongoing destruction. Babeth Borne, the current government responsible excuse, so gratified us with a recent speech in which she painfully summarized us the 22 (!) different workshops that it intends to open for an even greener, ecoconscious, inclusive, shared and solidarity ecological transition (which is, for reminder, the provision of official qualifications for “ecolo socialism all azimuts”).
331	19	Through easy payments and lyric flows perfectly in accordance with the inherent communicopathy of Macron and his sbires, the Prime Minister reminded that the government’s goal was, therefore, in all modesty and realism, to do more for the climate than France has accomplished in thirty-two years, the climate being – for reminder – this small weak and stumbling thing that only the French government can help to return to the norm, the rule and the stability.
331	21	Certainly, the history of these compulsive cyclomanes allows to keep a little optimism so they are generally null to realize their lubies but here, the ambition is concrete to reduce by at least 55% by 2030 the French greenhouse gas emissions, yet already microscopic. In other words, it is about cutting the access to energy even stronger and even further than it was done so far. If you’ve liked the pepper decrease of the last twelve months, you’ll love the next winter which will be just a pre-smack of the next winter that you can hardly imagine more and more without heating.
331	23	But, as a reminder, Macron is sharply opposed to nuclear power: it is enough to understand him to see the violent gap that there is between his endowed pipeautades when he talks about the maintenance and development of this energy in France, and his actions that consist of closing the reactors. As a reminder, the law that imposes the suspension of twelve additional reactors in a few years has not yet been abolished, even in the face of the current difficulties of EDF.
331	25	Therefore, it should be understood that everything that will be undertaken will be without oil, without gas, without shield, without natural, without nuclear, and essentially with wind molds and magical panels, both intermittent, economically catastrophic and with ridiculous yield. This will give the 22 buildings (or rather, 22 government carpet bombing zones if you want to look at reality in front) articulated in six themes (moving, housing, feeding, producing, consuming and preserving ecosystems) all the freedom to experience with the shortage, bricolage and inevitable pollution that will result in the circumstances and derivations that all imposed collectivist systems always end up producing.
331	27	And that’s the most beautiful thing: thus claiming to fight a chemical climate distortion and wanting to make ecology the cornerstone of their government aneries, this band of clowns will lead to the exact opposite effect of the desired. This is a prediction more than a prediction and it takes no risk: if we let these destroying tricks and because of their efforts, France will be in a few years more polluted, dirty and much less green than it is now.
331	29	If you find France polluted right now, say to yourself that it is a paradise next to what it will become under the boots of these regrettable policies.
3310	1	Vegetarian Menus in Grenoble: A Bloody Disapproval for Ecologist Mayor Eric Piolle
3310	3	It was one of the polemics raised in the media snow of the return: Eric Piolle, the ecologist mayor of Grenoble – re-elected with more than 53% of the votes – heard imposing vegetarian menus on the cantine, where 80% of the grenoblois children lunch. It was, of course, to authoritarianly promote the red-green ideology: under the pretext that it is good for the planet – because livestock is polluted, they say – it was heard to deprive the little ones of the pleasure of steak-frites. And, of course, under the carpet was the spinous question of the halal menus to relieve the pressure on this community electorate. A stone with two shots.
3310	5	And then the parents woke up. Believing the results of this much more political than social measure, the parents of these children scored, at 94% for the blue and red menus, fish or meat. All parents, or almost, rejected this ecolo-dingo lubia. Among these, let’s assume that there should be electors of Eric Piolle, former Friday afternoon protesters followers of Greta.
3310	7	But not only. “Do not touch our children,” this is clearly the message addressed to the mayor ideologist. It is a manifest political error that shows, in trouble, that the ethereal spheres in which the ecologists evolve where all the simple, immemorial, pleasures of everyday life must be banned are far away from the social reality that the French today live. This failure of Eric Piolle also shows, beyond the properly found good sense of these parents, that the left is not concerned with the social issue at all. Has he just come to mind that, for a large number of children, the meal of the cantine with meat or fish is sometimes the only real meal that they can afford in times of crisis and galopant inflation? Did Eric Piolle just cross the doors of a supermarket or a cartridge this summer? Would this decision be made in June? According to a study by the company a3distrib by West France, the hashed steacks of a well-known butcher brand increased by 30%. It was in June, so he knew.
3310	9	This obvious disapproval – it is an euphemism! It sounds like a metaphor of the racing of the French who have been imposed for two years all kinds of injuries and deprivations, to whom it is repeated that we are in war, against Covid, against Russia, against climate warming, etc. This little-foot authoritarianism, this deprivation of simple pleasures and above all this manifest intrusion in our way of living, working, raising and feeding our children, this punitive and radical ecology – a word that suddenly becomes charged with respect due to strong convictions – this economy of deprivations, the French hardly accept it. Beyond the insult to the good sense – because depriving children of the essential contribution to their growth of animal proteins is one of them – this measure, as safrened, ridiculous and symbolic it is, was, once again, an attack on what remains of the art of living to the French through the balanced pleasures of the table.
3311	1	The World Economic Forum encourages the consumption of lost foods
3311	3	More meat but insects; more fresh foods but lost foods; water based on excrements; synthetic foods... The hallucinated transhumanist oligarchs leave no doubt: they take care of your health! from
3311	5	Schwab is a dirty man. The World Economic Forum has convinced the UK to remove food expiration dates in order to “limit food waste.” In fact, these sick individuals do not worry about human health and need a way to distract attention from the upcoming food shortages caused by their chemical dream of zero emissions.
3311	7	"The UK is preparing to remove the ""preferably consuming before"" and the labels of approximately 500 products. When was the food delivered or packed? The consumer must rely on his judgment. It is also planned to delete hundreds of expiration dates on the products. The mention ""best purchase"" indicates the quality of the food, while the mention ""to consume preferably before the"" indicates whether the food is consumable. The World Economic Forum insists that these dates have no meaning, as it is always possible to consume extinguished foods. He even claims that milk is the third most wasted product in the UK, while it is extremely dangerous to drink if it is extinct."
3311	9	The expiration dates appeared for the first time in stores after World War II, when major consumer chains gained popularity. Before that, you could talk to family shops sellers, who were taking care of their products and their customers. You may buy directly from the manufacturer, depending on where you lived. You cannot ask a Publix employee from where an apple comes, for example, and hope for a precise answer. Food is now arrived by full trucks and is often imported from abroad.
3311	11	The World Economic Forum would therefore want us to eat lost insects and food. Be sure that the elite will eat what is best, move in its jet and yachts heated by fossil fuels and laugh while the rest of us will suffer. Governments seem to be part because they don’t want to admit their failure as a result of food shortages.
3312	1	The ambiguity of “religion”
3312	3	For decades, bimillennial Catholicism in France is wiped out of the visual field of society, while the newly arrived Islam affirms itself all asimuths and aims to a centrality in public life.
3312	5	Different facts, social events, debates and controversies involving Islam take a more and more invasive place in the present day. Often like the local tree that hides the international forest from the challenges of generalized Islamization...
3312	7	This is probably what makes the meaning of the words that are found in the media subreptically. When journalists talk about “religion,” it’s never about Catholicism, Protestantism or Judaism, it’s always about Islam.
3312	9	Thus, when “young” of cities are interviewed in opinion surveys, it turns out that the sharia focuses their preference on the laws of the Republic, and they are pleased to speak of “religion” to designate their Islamic membership.
3312	11	After the disputes around the vessel, here is that the recent dispute of Islamic clothes in the school is also revealing that desire to capture all forms of visibility in the public space. All this in the name of religion.
3312	13	Meanwhile, the bishops observe a prudent silence in everything concerning the so-called “live together”, the subject being hyper sensitive, and the maps seriously confused by the incessant recommendations of unconditional reception of foreigners by the Roman instances. The risk of naively confusing the evangelical welcoming of the next – that is, people – with the submission to the massive flow of migrants.
3312	15	There is no doubt, “religion” is no longer what it was!
3313	1	Ukrainian citizens shocked: Jeremy Corbyn calls for “a peace agreement with Russia rather than fighting”
3313	3	Furious reaction of the Ukrainians, after the former Labour leader said in an interview that the West suppliing weapons to the country would “extend and exaggerate” the unprovoked war of Vladimir Putin.
3313	5	Jeremy Corbyn raised the frustration, anger and disappointment of the Ukrainians after stating in an interview that they should seek a peace agreement with Russia rather than fighting with weapons supplied by the West.
3313	7	Speaking on the site Al Mayadeen (1) earlier this week, the former leader of the Labour Party urged countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States to cease weapons to Ukraine in the name of “the security and security of the whole world”.
3313	9	“Living weapons will not bring a solution,” he said. This will only extend and exaggerate this war. We are at risk of living years and years of war in Ukraine... sending more and more weapons to Ukraine will not bring peace.
3313	11	This war is disastrous for the Ukrainian people and the Russian people and therefore there is much more effort to do for peace. »
3313	13	How could a prominent member of the British anti-imperialist movement suggest negotiating with an imperialist aggressor?
3313	15	In Ukraine, the comments were welcomed with unbelief. How could a prominent member of the British anti-imperialist movement suggest negotiating with an imperialist aggressor?
3313	17	“As a person fascinated by the left wing of the European and American political spectrum, I have to say that Jeremy Corbyn is someone I’ve sometimes admired,” journalist Oleksandra Povoroznyk told Byline Times. “You can imagine my disappointment at this moment.
3313	19	I would be very surprised that Corbyn actually talked to Ukrainians or even that he knows of them, because I noticed that even the best-intentioned Western experts, even the most pro-Ukrainian, do not really want to listen to what Ukrainian citizens say.
3313	21	Many people in the West refuse to Ukraine any form of autonomy by claiming that we are constantly manipulated by NATO or that it is a war by procurement of the United States and that the West forces us to fight. None of these people pay attention to what we really say. It is sad and boring.”
3313	23	There cannot be concessions or negotiations with Vladimir Putin.
3313	25	Any peace agreement now concluded between Russia and Ukraine would actually reward the imperialist and expansionist invasion of Russia. Vladimir Putin’s army currently occupies approximately 20% of Ukraine’s territory – an area equivalent to half of the UK – and is already trying to permanently annex the parties occupied since February.
3313	27	A massive proportion of 84% of Ukrainians are opposed to a peace agreement with Russia if it involves the cession of territories to Russia, and yet Jeremy Corbyn did not make any reference in his interview to the withdrawal of Russian troops.
3313	29	Ukrainian deputy Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the European Parliament’s Foreign Affairs committee, told Byline Times that “there is no other solution than to provide Ukraine with all the heavy weapons needed, because Russia will never stop.”
3313	31	“Putin’s goal is to delete Ukraine from the map of the world,” he said. He commits a genocide against the Ukrainian nation. If the West ceases to supply weapons to Ukraine, it will help Putin to occupy Ukraine and to exterminate the Ukrainians.
3313	33	Peace with people like Putin or Hitler is impossible. They only use it as a temporary rest to accumulate forces and continue. »
3313	35	A peace agreement now concluded would involve not only that Ukraine definitively surrender this territory to Russia, but also that it condemns the Ukrainians living there to a life under brutal occupation.
3313	37	“Even if we reach a kind of ceasefire and we give part of our territory to Russia, the war will not end, because we can see in the occupied territories that people are tortured, murdered and raped every day,” added Oleksandra Povoroznyk.
3313	39	Ukraine is planning a counter-offensive in the coming months to recover the territory around the city of Kherson, where human rights groups have recorded countless cases of torture, arbitrary detention and forced disappearance of civilians, turning the region into a “abdomen of fear and wild anarchy.”
3313	41	The planned counteroffensive can only succeed thanks to weapons supplied by countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Without them, the “abyss of fear and wild anarchy” would become permanent.
3313	43	Stas Olenchenko, co-founder and author of Ukraine Explainers, said that an agreement with Russia is out of question because “I don’t think anyone would feel safe living in this kind of world.”
3313	45	“If you are ready to conclude a peace agreement with Russia now, at the price of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, you should think about the type of security system you will get: a system that rewards colonial conquest, genocide and chantage to the rest of the world by hunger and nuclear war,” he said.
3313	47	The Kremlin’s true intentions toward Ukraine are not a secret – they are broadcast daily on the state-controlled media channels and declared publicly by Russian political leaders.
3313	49	Former President Dimitry Medvedev, who is now the Vice-President of the Security Council of Russia, publicly said he hoped that Ukraine “disappears from the map.”
3313	51	“Russian talk shows – all approved and controlled by the Kremlin – are treating Ukrainians as ‘animals’, ‘Nazi’ and members of a ‘completely false nation’.
3313	53	The articles of the state-backed news chains openly call for the “liquidation” of the Ukrainians.
3313	55	- In a message on social networks, since deleted, Medvedev wrote on August 2 that:
3313	57	“Russia must restore the Soviet Union at its old borders,” he added, “the country of Georgia does not exist, and it should be part of the empire with Abkhazia and Ossetia.”
3313	59	The reason Jeremy Corbyn thinks it is necessary to negotiate with Russia at this stage escapes the Ukrainians themselves.
3313	61	“We have not attacked anyone – we defend our homes, our lands and our sovereignty,” said Natalia Haidai, a Russian-speaking Ukrainian woman from Bucha.
3313	63	Corbyn’s argument is that the Ukrainians should leave, that they are unable to defend themselves, and that they must be literally destroyed. I thought he was for solidarity with the oppressed people?
3313	65	Genocide is not peace. It is clear that Putin wants to eradicate Ukraine and the Ukrainian people from the surface of the Earth. If we can’t defend ourselves, that’s what will happen. »
3313	67	In addition to the realities on the ground, it is also necessary to count on the history of Russia as a “reliable negotiation partner.”
3313	69	“Ukraine has tried the way of diplomacy many times,” said journalist Oleksandra Povoroznyk. “Russia did not speak and the Budapest Memorandum showed us that saying that they will not invade does not mean that they will speak. »
3313	71	No Ukrainians agree with Corbyn’s point of view
3313	73	No Ukrainian except one demonstrated to say they thought what Corbyn said was useful or accurate.
3313	75	A pro-Corbyn tweet claimed that his “family had to leave Odessa and now lives in Austria” and the tweet author added: “What was Jeremy Corbyn saying wrong? If it were any other politician, the people would listen to it.”
3313	77	The tweet has collected over 2,000 likes and retweets.
3313	79	But when a journalist asked if she could contact him for a comment, she answered “no” and blocked him.
3313	81	She then deleted her original tweet.
3313	83	In addition, a keyword search in her Twitter history has led to contradictory tweets about the Ukrainian heritage of her family.
3313	85	Another pro-Corbyn account tweeted:
3313	87	“He is quite right. The war in Ukraine is managed by Britain and America, and it is the poor Ukrainian people who pay the ultimate price. When asked how many Ukrainians she had spoken about Ukraine, she replied, “I don’t need to discuss with Ukrainians to make an opinion with the evidence available since 2014. to grow. »
3313	89	Finally, a former Ukrainian trade framework who is unemployed since the beginning of the invasion said:
3313	91	“Putin will try to annex as much Ukrainian territory as possible to sell it as a victory to his people. This will only strengthen his imperialist ambitions. No option where Putin is winning will give Ukraine a long peace. »
3313	93	Conclusion
3313	95	A single country has a large population of Russians and Ukrainians, and it is Israel. About a million Russians emigrated to Israel when the iron curtain opened in the early 1990s. There is no one Russian in Israel at the moment. Those I have questioned have denied being Russians: they are ashamed of what their country of birth has just done. You will not meet a Russian-Israeli man who supports Putin’s invasion.
3314	1	The time of rationalization
3314	3	Macron and his government have therefore set up a “energy sobriety” plan. The temperature of the houses should be limited to nine degrees. For the bedrooms, it will be only 17 degrees. The heating water will have to be fixed at fifty-five degrees. There are a lot of penalties for the infringers.
3314	5	I don’t know what means of surveillance the government has, but the threat in itself can be sufficient to scare in view of the announced amounts, a thousand five hundred euros. Electric and electronic devices will have to be turned off when they are not used, and I don’t even know what means of surveillance are considered by the government, but I assume that the threat of fines, probably of the same amount as for the temperature of houses will have an effect. Electricity cuts are planned. Businesses will have to shut down their schools. The monuments will no longer be lighted at night. Paris can no longer be called the city of light and will become an extinct city, which it was almost already, in addition to being a city affected by the bursts voluntarily created by the mayor. Programable thermostats are offered and are not yet mandatory, but that will come.
3314	7	All this is supposed to be the result, mostly, of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, of the sanctions that the European governments have taken against Russia, and of the decisions made by Putin in rejection against the European countries. All of this, I have already said, and I have to repeat it, has other origins.
3314	9	All this is fundamentally due to the ecological policy followed by the French government which, in this, does not distinguish itself from other European governments. More than half of the French nuclear power plants are closed and cannot be restored due to lack of maintenance. The director said the power plants had not beenined because they were planned to be closed, and two of them, including the Fessenheim power plant, have already been closed. There is in the underground of a number of European countries, including France, gas and shist oil, but it would be ecologically incorrect to use it, and ecologist movements said it was dangerous, and their lubies were followed by the letter.
3314	11	European countries buy U.S. schist gas: years ago in the U.S. schist gas and oil are produced without any danger for anyone. The Biden administration strives to follow the ecologists and to imitate Europe, but, although it has already done heavy damages, it has not led the United States to a shipwreck similar to the forming in Europe. And what takes shape in Europe is actually a shipwreck.
3314	13	What is implemented in France, as in other countries of Europe, is not a plan of “soverty”, no, it is the organization of a shortage, of an unnecessary and destructive rationalization, and of a system of generalized surveillance. The European peoples see all their freedoms being restricted, and what is happening right now is only the follow-up of long-established policies. The French and other Europeans were supposed to do “gests for the planet” (who doesn’t need these gestures). They are constantly guilty of all-present reminders about carbon emissions, while carbon is not a pollutant. We are talking to them at every moment of an anthropic climate warming that does not exist.
3314	15	Beton flows in cities, throughout Europe, in order to asphyx motor traffic in cities, and where it is still possible, areas where the speed is limited to thirty kilometers per hour proliferate, which increases many transaction costs.
3314	17	This must be repeated: the ecologist discourse is an anti-humanist neo-communist discourse that leads the societies that surrender it to extinction and death.
3314	19	If a surshake does not take place very quickly, the sliding towards the extinction and death of Europe could become irreversible. It is terrible, serious, and revolting. Unfortunately, there’s no overcrowd on the horizon, but a refinery strike that really occurs at the right time, endless waiting lines in front of the service stations, re-sales of fuel to the black market, and scenes of violence. a sad situation.
3314	21	And if I had to add insecurity, the terrible and more frequent crimes (I’m going to go back), the illegal and uncontrolled immigration, the unlawful areas that are growing, there would be something to be even more sad, and very angry.
3315	1	Macron: “We don’t have oil and we don’t have an idea”
3315	3	Fuel Crisis: Macron is overwhelmed. He met Borne and the ministers concerned on Monday afternoon in Elysée.
3315	5	Emmanuel Macron doesn’t know what to do. As at the beginning of the Coronavirus, his mental equipment did not prepare him for unprecedented situations. The government, not knowing what to do, began to panic. He requisitioned Feyzin (Rhône) fuel deposits from 14 p.m. on Monday, following that of Mardyck (Flanders) deposits near Dunkerque at 6 p.m. this morning.
3315	7	On Sunday on TF1, Prime Minister Elizabeth Borne estimated that the first requests had produced their effect, and Monday morning, she was already desperately looking for what else to do. So Macron takes things in his hands, but he patates.
3315	9	He is currently meeting with the Prime Minister and the relevant government members to “to make a point of the situation.” Getting a point means lifting your finger if you have an idea. And no one has any idea: these genius closed the nuclear power plants before they had a replacement solution!
3315	11	But the head of state is a leader, a real. He promised to “continue doing the maximum,” and what matters, is not, is to do the maximum. Especially with the minimum. In addition, if you don’t find fuel, you can fill your gas tank with Macron’s promises, it works as well.
3315	13	Macron, however, demonstrated authority, and “claimed a solution as soon as possible.” What authority, what authority.
3315	15	Since the Prime Minister has no ideas or oil, a desperate Macron turned to his ministers Bruno Le Maire (Economy), Agnès Pannier-Runacher (Energy Transition), Christophe Béchu (Ecological Transition), Clément Beaune (Transports) and government spokesman Olivier Véran in the hope that one of these brilliant officials will have a light of intelligence. In the meantime, they are all guaranteed that their cars and their escort will be filled with fuel.
3315	17	Therefore, it is a president comfortable protected from problems who said:
3315	19	“I am by the side of all our compatriots who gallery and who have enough of this situation.”
3315	21	Then the Francilians were offered 45 minutes of free Velib on Tuesday.
3316	1	“Today, two-thirds of crimes and crimes are committed by individuals from immigration, not only foreigners, but also first- or second-generation migrants.
3316	3	Laurent Obertone’s “Guerilla 3 The Last Battle”
3316	5	France has gone through the worst crisis in its history. Prepare for the last battle. A banal falls down in a city, young people killed by a police officer.
3316	7	The collapse of the country and the collapse of the state. Twenty-seven days later, the order seems finally back, with him the media, the vice-political and citizen, while large areas of the territory are still deprived of everything, and some still refuse to deposit the weapons.
3316	9	Under an intense conditioning and the impulse of “civil” militias, the crisis seems under control. In fact, nothing is fixed. The suspended power could be violently confronted to its borders, and France delivered to a much more terrible chaos.
3316	11	In the midst of this indekse convulsion, Gite, Escard, Danjou, the girl and the others are all preparing to throw their last forces into the final confrontation. Here is the universe reduced to terror, and here is the time of total war.
3316	13	After his first two best-seller toms The Day Everything Kissed and The Time of the Barbarians, Laurent Obertone continues his journey to the End of Hell and magically concludes his Guerilla saga: the collapse of a nation.
3317	1	Energy crisis: Russia proposes a “gas hub” to Europe allowing European households to receive gas at less “exorbitant” prices...
3317	3	During a meeting with his Turkish counterpart on October 13, the Russian president suggested the creation of a “gas hub” in Turkey, claiming that this would allow Europeans to receive gas at less “exorbitant” prices, reports TF1. The French government immediately opposed this idea, highlighting its will to leave the Russian gas.
3317	5	To resolve the energy crisis in Europe, which leaves fear of energy shortages this winter and the impossibility for many households to be able to settle their energy factor due to the price flows in this sector, Vladimir Putin proposed to create a “gas hub” in Turkey on the occasion of a meeting with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the margins of a regional forum in Kazakhstan on Thursday, October 13. The Russian president said this would give Europeans the opportunity to benefit from gas at less “exorbitant” prices.
3317	7	There is no sense for Paris.
3317	9	The French government immediately opposed this idea: “There is no sense for us to create new infrastructure that would allow more Russian gas to be imported,” he justifies. He added: “A few months ago, almost 40% of the gas supplied to the European Union came from Russia. Today, this share of Russian gas is only 7.5 percent and it is still called to decrease. »
3317	11	Since the beginning of the war, the European Union has worked, despite the consequences for the population, to rapidly and drastically decrease its dependence on Russian gas. “It is possible that Russia and Turkey decide together to export more gas, but it cannot be to the European Union that has commitments of sovereignty, of reduction of its dependencies and otherwise of climate transition that are incompatible with this kind of reasoning.”
3317	13	EU decreases its dependence on Russia and increases its dependence on the US
3317	15	To deal with the decrease in Russian gas, the European Union has decided to increase its imports of shield from the United States, a country on which many suspects about its responsibility for sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines. According to U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, the equivalent in France of the Foreign Minister, the sabotage against the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines is a “fortunate opportunity” to “eliminate once and for all the dependence on Russian energy,” he said after the sabotage of the energy pipelines.
3317	17	"U.S. Secretary of State Blinken said the sabotage against the #NordStream pipelines is ""a formidable opportunity"" to ""eliminate once and for all the dependence on Russian energy."""
3318	1	The West exploits the Rusophobic criminal regime - Lavrov
3318	3	The West, led by the United States, continues to conduct a hybrid war against Russia, increasing the supply of weapons and providing intelligence to the Kiev regime in order to destroy it. This is what Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a speech spoke at the plenary session of the XXIV World Council of the Russian People, read by the ambassador charged with special missions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guennadiy Askaldovich, reports TASS.
3318	5	“The Western people use the Rusophobic criminal regime of [Ukrainian President] Vladimir Zelensky as one of the leviers to conquer our country. We see Washington and its NATO allies intensify the supply of deadly weapons to the Ukrainian neonazi, share intelligence with them and recruit foreign mercenaries to send to Ukraine. All this, to a degree or to another, makes them participants in the conflict,” Lavrov said in a statement.
3318	7	He stressed that the US-led collective West, “defined to dominate the world,” had launched a “totally hybrid war” against Russia.
3318	9	“Our enemies do not make a mystery of their goals: to destroy the Russian economy, to break the internal political stability, to defeat us on the battlefield and, in the end, to considerably weaken, or even to destroy, the secular national state,” Lavrov said.
3318	11	This could explain, according to him, the fact that today “a culture of abolition runs in the West against Russia.”
3318	13	“All restrictions on any action against us have been removed. The logic is that if you hate the multinational Russian people, everything is permitted to you,” the Russian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
3318	15	Washington accuses Beijing of “breaking the U.S. judicial system” Washington accuses Beijing of “breaking the U.S. judicial system”
3319	1	Rishi Sunak, a very rich prime minister, is more Hindu than English!
3319	3	It feels the beginning of the end for the West, more and more... and a man of color at the head of England, one! If it was just a story of skin color, more or less bronze color... Unfortunately, the situation is much worse.
3319	5	Even the proud Albion who had refused to submit to the Europeanist dictatorship could return to the rank, giving up his blood, his rank, the religious heritage of Henry VIII... There is no coincidence. At the time the clique of the subsidized media insists on the desperate state of the English economy, it arrives on its proud Marwari, with its multi-billionaire wife, its immoderate love of Hindu traditions and religions, and its pressing desire to see what was the country of Victoria wrapping in front of the mediocre der Leyen.
3319	7	I have nothing against the Hindu Day of Light, The Hindu Day by Excellence, The Diwali. And I support the Hinduists against the Islam that progresses in India with the strikes of violence and chantage.
3319	9	But anyway...
3319	11	A prime minister of England who tries to be invested in the day of Diwali is a disorder.
3319	13	A Prime Minister of England who, when he was Chancellor of the Equator (= Minister of Finance) had lighted candles on 11 Downing Street, for Diwali, “I was very proud of this moment, to be able to do this on the steps of Downing Street.”
3319	15	A prime minister of England who, in 2015, had sworn in to the Parliament on the Holy Book of the Hindu, is a disorder.
3319	17	Rishi Sunak is a globalist, and the English risks crying with tears of blood with the economic policy he will implement. It is remembered that he had hanged strongly with Tuss for the tax credits she wanted to impose and her economic policy that led her to resign.
3319	19	Isn’t it said that, above all, Rishi Sunak would be the candidate of China and... of Schwab (which would explain that he had been elected?and??? In other words, he went to the bankers, like a certain Macron. Before entering politics, he worked in finance, especially at Goldman Sachs, and founded his own investment company.
3319	21	In short, the former colony gave its master to England. And the colonization with all the “Asian” immigration. The same thing is happening in France with Algeria.
3319	23	Also questioned by the Guardian, Sunder Katwala, head of the think tank on immigration and culture “British Future”, believes that his victory” shows that (...) the highest British spheres can be open to all ethnic beliefs and origins. It will be a source of pride for many British of Asian origin, even for those who do not share the conservative opinions of Rishi Sunak.”
3319	25	And here we learn that the quidam is immensely rich, twice more than the immaculate Islamophile Charles who already has an immeasurable fortune... thanks, especially to his wife, very rich heir of his father, owner of nfosys or Tata Consultancy who were Trump’s targets in his anti-migration policy.
3319	27	This valuable couple, careful for the well-being of the English people, did not pay, so far, tax on their immense fortune in the United Kingdom, their country of residence.
3319	29	Some already announce that he would have been there only to discredit the Conservative Party forever and allow the return in fanfare of the Labour Party...European Party in the Devil. Who could get back to Brexit? All that for that? Possible...
3319	31	It will last longer than Truss, but during the 2024 general elections, Rishi Sunak will end up dissolving the conservative party permanently. Through the weaknesses of British parliamentarism, it will bring the UK back into the Customs Union and European Immigration. He will be one of the biggest betrayers of Brexit. Brexit will be permanently buried and at these general elections in 2023, Ken Starmer and his Labour Party could return to power. They will make sure that everything will go back as it was before and that England will be put back to the Europeanists.
3319	33	Globalists are progressing in Europe, that is true. But maybe that’s what will accelerate their end. Let us cross our fingers. With the help of Putin.
332	1	Will the Russian regime support the revolt in Europe?
332	3	Like the Americans, the Russians consider, since the Cold War, it is perfectly legitimate and desirable to act on information in Europe.
332	5	According to a U.S. intelligence report broadcast, in a very parcelary way, in September last year, the Russian regime had spent, since 2014, three hundred million dollars to support candidates and political parties around the world.
332	7	However, this report seems at least incomplete.
332	9	First of all, because the information is spread only on the drop accounts, and through the governments concerned. Then, because the amount — worldwide, since 2014 — seems, in reality, rather dirty. Finally, because this same report is very appropriate to impass the Russian support and interference in the United States!
332	11	More significantly, the proven, detailed and public financing, by the Russian regime, of two German ecological foundations, one with a competition of 10 million euros and the other with a competition of 192 million euros. These data are not contested. They also reveal, in contrast, the weakness of the U.S. report: here we talk about 200 million, in two payments, for Germany alone.
332	13	Thus, the collaborative Germany of the Russian regime is undoubtedly the Green Germany. The Russian propaganda is without opinion; it, of course, serves the only Russian interests that have been wonderfully combined, for 15 years, with the ecologist claims (destruction of civil nuclear power, prohibition of schist gas) and that marry, today, with the citizens' revolt against unpaid energy.
332	15	The direct intervention of the Russian regime in the internal affairs of the Western countries is a proven massive fact, which is likely to increase in the coming months. In the current state of the available amounts and amounts, this intervention is more done with foundations and movements at the extreme left of the political spectrum than at the right of the political spectrum.
332	17	Strategically speaking, the revolt movements in Europe against energy expensive are a blessed bread for the Russian regime, according to which gas supplies to Europe can start immediately and that it is sufficient, in this regard, that the Germans open the Nord-Stream 2 robinet.
332	19	We are entering a winter that is terrible for many Europeans—the next will probably be even more—who will literally have to choose between eating and heating. When the national gas reserves will be exhausted — it’s just a matter of time, even if they’re almost 100% right now — the only gas actually available and paid will be Russian gas. The only thing is not to lie. Replacing the Russian gas of structural solutions (US LNG, the exploitation of ski gas in Europe, massive nuclear resuscitation) will take time.
332	21	Meanwhile, just importing gas by methaneers from India, China – which has never bought so much gas... from Russia – will lead, in the winter hole, the price of European gas beyond the already grotesque records of August 2022. All of this the Russians know. The rebellion is certain. To promote it, for Russian propagandists, who are struggling professionals, will be easy.
332	23	In the current context, the strike of the refineries in France is of blessed bread, the providence of the propagandists who try to show the disappointment of Europeans. Good God, the French breaks their mouth in front of the service stations!
332	25	From a strict military point of view, the Russian regime is in a weak position. He therefore plays a delicate partition and I see him strengthen his propaganda actions, especially towards the soft stomach of the Western Alliance, which is Europe.
332	27	Let’s wait for the strategy that the RAND Corporation described in a 2016 report on Russian propaganda as the Firehose of Falsehood:
332	29	“The contemporary Russian propaganda is continuous and very reactive to events. Because of their lack of commitment to the objective reality, Russian propagandists don’t need to wait to check the facts or affirmations; they just disseminate an interpretation of emerging events that seems to favour their themes and their objectives. This allows them to be remarkably reactive and agile, often broadcasting the first news of events (and, with a similar frequency, the first news of non-events, or things that have not actually happened). »
332	31	The energy misery that the Europeans, poisoned by the green ideology, have inflicted on themselves, will mechanically trigger the rebellion of men and women to the abyss. The propagandists of the Russian regime will only have to fall down to harvest their fruits.
3320	1	and yes! I’m a fascist and I’m a fan of you.
3320	3	If for you, being a fascist, it is to have in horror this false mortal religion which is Islam, if it is to want that there is no longer any trace of it in my country, that all the mosques be thus shattered, the Muslims thus thrown out of our borders and that we no longer see their wives with their foulards and their men in qamis and whole neighborhoods where there is no more one French, if it is thus generalizing for them the OQTF... then yes! I am a fascist because I claim the natural right to love or not to love whether it likes or not to good-thought!
3320	5	If for you, to be fascist, it is to implore by striking very strongly the restoration of the death penalty against the terrorists, the drug traffickers and the crabs who kill children, violate women and whose psychiatric experts claim that they are incurable, if it is to refuse for them any little tolerance, if it is still to clean the corrupt justice because it is very often composed of judges who prefer waste to victims by refusing the legitimate defense to those who want to preserve those they love and their property, who prefer the crabs to the short owners, who no longer know how to make the difference between good and evil... I am a fascist because I want a righteousness that does not degenerate and returns to its foundations!
3320	7	If for you, to be a fascist, it means to put down definitively, and without complexity, all the wicked who benefit from the pain of young people above all and people who have not had luck in their lives, to give them the drug and ruin their lives even more until they lead them to death, making themselves a pack of poignons,... then yes! I am fascist because I want the society of my country, and especially its youth, to be healthy and always have in them, the hope of a simple and why not, joyful life!
3320	9	If for you, to be a fascist, it is to eliminate homosexual marriage, the PMA and other saloperies thus, to put a definitive end to LGBTQI propaganda, to eliminate their gay prides, to barrage the destructive wokism of the little that remains of our values and that comes to us from the country whose customs are the most ruined in the world, that is, the United States, to eliminate this new right consisting in helping children who want to change gender, then yes! I am a fascist because I want the people of my country to remain in conformity with the laws of nature that are a factor of balance and well-being!
3320	11	If for you, being a fascist, it is to want to choose another path of the economy for a system that accounts for all the actors of the company without privileging a category, which consequently equally distributes the wealth so that we can no longer see SDFs, people horribly alone because they are abandoned like our old, then yes! I am fascist because I no longer want to see weak bordels as we have just seen with the strikes in refineries but above all because I want the new economic system to have for one and only value, respect for all and simply because that same respect for all avoids ever-reductive confrontations.
3320	13	If finally for you, to be a fascist, it is to want another political system that there yet privileges respect by imposing the popular referendum, that is, which puts an end to what they call “representative democracy”, term which is a true antinomy and therefore, a beautiful hypocrisy for naturally all of us to sleep,... then yes! I am a fascist because I am convinced that it is possible to finally establish the democracy, that democracy that the crowds for decades and decades have demanded in cor and cry.
3320	15	Finally you see, you the unhonest who kill our country, if you have, during the reading of these few phrases, made the effort to open a little or a little your minds, you will have understood that I am more washer than fascist... for simply, there is an urgent need to make a great wash in our country!
3321	1	Muslims accuse LGBT propaganda in schools
3321	3	How to “draw” children according to E&R. The drag story hour is the time of the drag. After the study, it turns out that this is a wonderful encounter between children and Drag Queens (DQ).
3321	5	What is a drag Queen? It’s a man who dresses up as a lady and plays with the lady. They are men. We have never seen a woman dressing up as a woman, otherwise it would be known, and there are no women dressing up as men to play with the man. Yes, it’s a kind of theatre, focused on gender change. There are two genres according to science, not 36: man and woman.
3321	7	Then there’s a child, but it’s not a kind. As this is placed, the American DQ men organize meetings with children whose parents are tolerant. Meeting to rape them. No, what devil, to familiarize them with gender, gender change, gender mixture, with sexual confusion. In the United States, a country of all freedoms, we have the right to send children to the feet of the DQ. “Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH), Drag Queen Storytime and Drag Story Time are children’s events launched for the first time in 2015 by author and activist Michelle Tea in San Francisco, “with the aim of inspiring the love of reading, while teaching more in-depth lessons about diversity, self-love and appreciation of others.”
3321	9	The events, generally intended for children aged 3 to 11, are animated by Drag Queens who read children’s books and participate in learning activities in public libraries. The DQSH concept is considered unconventional because libraries are reserved and queens are traditionally rather associated with bars and nightlife. The Queen? A queen is a person who reigns on a country, who has a crown on his head, but not all the time, who everyone loves and who is a woman. A DQ is therefore not a queen, even if she dresses herself as a queen.
3321	11	The words are important. In France, we have the US version, but, facing the public’s resistance called transphobe, the trans-pill is hard to pass. Family Day was celebrated at the Bizarre Festival in Paris. This was the third edition on October 16, 2022, summarized by the site alafolie.paris:
3321	13	“The festival dedicates its Sunday day on October 16 to families, the homoparent families in particular, the families that don’t go back into the clous, with a brunch to meet together and then activities for small and larger. The Drag Story Hours is a concept widespread in the United States, where children meet drag artists from the LGBTQIA+ community. Alternative fairy tales are read there to present an imaginary defeat of gender stereotypes. Meetings between dogs and trans (or travs, these half-trans), which may give trans dogs, you know! And at the same time, we can dream: a trans-president at Eliseo and the world may be more tolerant (source: E&R).
3321	15	The parents of Muslim students denounce LGBT books during a crowded meeting (dreuz.info).
3321	17	Muslims have found useful idiots with the politically correct left who don’t dare to denounce the extremist right and ultra-conservative ideas of Muslims.
3321	19	The truth is that they reject abortion, refuse homosexuality, are opposed to equality between men and women, and don’t talk to them about gender change! Hundreds of Muslim parents raised themselves violently against LGBTQ books during a meeting of the Michigan School Council in Dearborn County. When the parents refused to calm, the meeting was interrupted and postponed.
3321	21	During the chaos, the parents scanded towards the school council: “Get them out! In the heart of the dispute, books from the public schools of Dearborn, the third largest district of Michigan, including This Book Is Gay, a best-seller on sexuality and gender.
3321	23	Data from the census show that approximately 47% of Dearborn’s population is made up of Americans of Arab origin, many of which are Muslims, according to Firstpost. During the meeting, a Muslim parent read in a loud voice an extract of one of the books with sexually explicit content.
3321	25	“I met a variety of interesting people thanks to sexual applications,” Mohamed Musa read in one of the books. They are mainly used for sex. They are sold to us as social media apps, but we all know what they really serve. »
3321	27	Do you really want our kids to read this kind of book? “Moses went to the council.
3321	29	“Do you want your kids to download this type of apps? Do you want your child to meet a stranger and have sex with him? The crowd cried “No! “In response.
3321	31	“And then listen to the community,” said Moses. “Listen to the majority. Listen to the people who installed you [by their vote] in the functions you are currently occupying. Another parent denounced the sexually explicit content of the books and said that the majority of parents were not there to attack the school council or the LGBT community, but to denounce the content of the books.
3321	33	“The obviously inappropriate content in question has no place in our public schools. We have chosen you as a advice to protect our children from unsuitable content for their age. »
3321	35	Another non-Muslim parent stood up and accused the council of “proveing chaos.”
3321	37	“As a school council, you have allowed someone to stand here and deny Muslim faith,” Matthew Repereno told the council, referring to the meeting. “You didn’t stop him. You allowed another person to come here in front of the media and to encourage the crowd. »
3321	39	“On Monday, you prevented this audience and those parents from speaking,” Repereno continued.
3321	41	On the pancartes, we read: “If democracy counts, we are the majority”; “Homosexuality is a sin,” another said. Public discussions lasted about three hours, both sides showing their support or their disapproval of the books in question. The books included All Boys Aren’t Blue, The Lovely Bones, Flamer, Push and Red, White & Royal Blue. Some Republican citizens tired of the Woke policy joined the debate, showing their support to Muslim parents. Meshawn Maddock, co-president of the Republican Party of Michigan, and Steven Elliott, a Republican who appears against Rashida Tlaib in the November elections, supported Muslim protesters, reports Axios.
3321	43	The Muslim defenders joined the debate. The Michigan section of CAI (the Council for American-Islamic Relations), the largest Muslim group in the United States, has distributed tracks informing parents of their religious duties and parental rights. Despite this, progressive Muslim groups have supported the LGBT community and the leftists. Members of the American Federation of Teachers and Muslim Leaders published a joint statement: “Everyone thinks that our schools and classrooms must be safe, welcoming and solidary environments, free of any form of discrimination and intimidation... and that includes young people who identify themselves as LGBTQ. »
3321	45	Progressively, as they grow, the Muslims living in Western countries will rebell against all the Woke fantasies and impose a life closer to Islam.
3321	47	The leftists will be overwhelmed because the Muslims are motivated by religion and faith, and the leftists, only by the destruction of the bourgeois order (source: Jean-Patrick Grumberg).
3321	49	Zemmour: We must regain control of our country!
3322	1	The War in Ukraine to Forget the Crown Farce
3322	3	And of grace, let us not forget the most important thing. And the most important thing is that the true reason for the war in Ukraine (whose timing was, in fact, triggered by NATO gesticulations that forced Putin to react) is to make us forget, creating a large-scale distortion, that for three years humanity has been struck by the fake news covid and that the people who are responsible for this satanic disinformation, which has so much suffered, are still not judged and condemned.
3322	5	Without making an exhaustive list, let’s refresh the memory by reminding some disastrous consequences of the Crown Operation on the planet’s population:
3322	7	1) Double hunger on earth that led to the death of hundreds of millions of human beings (mort not from covid flu but measures taken to combat it).
3322	9	2) The collapse of human dignity with the imposition of the torch of submission (mask), which will leave long-term psychological traces, in particular by creating a “participative” submission precedent, which will make our next slavery even easier.
3322	11	3) Ethical awakening of humanity by forcing populations to be vaccinated with products not only dangerous, because not tested, but also that are made from lines of human embryonic cells (thus requiring, in advance, the death of embryos as part of abortions). We accept the idea of killing innocent beings to cure themselves... (intergenerational vampireism).
3322	13	Numerous deaths and very serious side effects due to the Big-Pharma vaccines.
3322	15	5) Everywhere in the world, countless number of dead elderly people hunted in the cold of hospitals without having the right to meet their loved ones for the last time (and all this so-called “for their good”, which makes things even more insupportable...).
3322	17	5) Failures, broken lives, suicides, clochardization, etc.
3322	19	6) Breakdown of the confidence pacte between the populations and their leaders in general (without which no society is viable) and the medical body in particular which, to say well, will behave at the time as a “puppy” (the one who, thanks to his knowledge, would have, on the contrary, had to be at the first lines of resistance, will not only be abandoned, but will even be actively placed on the side of the lie...).
3322	21	At a time when more and more evidence accumulates and the languages begin to spread around the world (including some of the Big Pharma’s executives) to denounce the farce of the crown, the racaille of the international establishment (bubble, without the knowledge of the Devil) has found nothing better than imposing us this war (which’s outcome may be nuclear) to escape its judgment.
3322	23	The disregarding reasoning of our tortioners is simple. They say, “Because the people have managed so easily to govern our invention of the crown, we will organize, so that it doesn’t come to the idea of asking us for accounts, the dramatic event,” which it will govern as well.
3322	25	Unfortunately, it seems to work wonderfully.
3323	1	Energy crisis and innovation
3323	3	Innovation, Innovation and Innovation?
3323	5	In Schumpeter’s analysis, innovation is the vector through which an economy is able to rebound after a crisis. Its analysis joins in this a cyclic vision of the economy in the sense that the economic actors are skilled in finding solutions to the problems posed as a result of a demand or supply shock that caused a crisis.
3323	7	However, the transition from analysis to practice is not as obvious and clear. While in the capitalist system it is commonly admitted that innovation is a source of new opportunities, the difficulties and means of implementation to promote the emergence of these innovations are more similar to a true path of the fighter than to a source-flowing achievement, to respond to an identified economic problem. In this, it seems very clear that the so-called capitalist system is in no way a practical system whose means are easily accessible and mobilizable.
3323	9	Let us take the following example to further illustrate this analysis. We will face an energy crisis in the coming months. The first effects are already felt on the tariffs and soon on the insufficient quantities of energy that can be mobilized to meet our needs. This seems, in the economic jargon, to a shock of supply.
3323	11	To answer this question, what solutions are presented to us?
3323	13	Consuming less? Government has never found anything better as a solution. The first measures of rationalization have already been voted by the Prime Minister, with possible electricity cuts for two hours a day...Is this the beginning? In that pace of course.
3323	15	To optimize the existing means of energy production using the maximum capacity of our means of production? Electric power plants, solar blocks, and others. Of course, this would be the most obvious immediate answer. The difficulty lies in the inadequate calibration of these methods of energy production with the real energy needs of the French population. On the other hand, a redimension of these networks would require colossal infrastructure costs and too long implementation times in time to meet the short and medium-term needs of the population.
3323	17	It remains the solution for innovation. The ideas for creating energy are not missing. Inventors in their garage are many, just see on Youtube, the ingenuity of “sunday brickers” to reduce their energy consumption for their car or the energy consumption of their home.
3323	19	The problem is that these inventors don’t necessarily have entrepreneurial fiber to put their inventions on the market, and that even when they have it, the financing difficulties for the development and marketing of these innovations are colossal. I don’t even talk about administrative and regulatory difficulties.
3323	21	In fact, we have long believed that to develop an economic activity, it was enough to identify an opportunity and offer a product that meets that opportunity to be able to market it. I am doing this for pedagogical purposes.
3323	23	But, in the present case, to propose a viable energy solution, it would be to re-establish a whole industrial economy in place, established, with its barons, we dare the word, its mafias, or related ones who would see with a very bad eye that we come to disturb their hunt guarded, with their regulated prices, their monthly subscriptions all this as says the EDF slogan because “they owe us more than the light.”
3323	25	Therefore, if your innovation is viable and feasible, your firm dossier and your competent team, it is not enough to present yourself before the bankier, the investment fund, or BPI France or the region for public financing.
3323	27	Innovation is the word cream cake promoted by public institutions and also from the business world but it should not be overwhelming.
3323	29	And in addition, if your innovation allows you to create energy without having to pay a monthly subscription that can provide tax revenues to administrations and shareholders in a recurrent way, then there you have not understood anything in the meaning of the word “Innovation”.
3323	31	Possible Innovation: The Water Engine
3323	33	The principle is to create the vapour in a container by creating the emptiness in it. You run a piston like on a classic steam engine that produces mechanical energy. You will then recover the steam to turn it into water into a distillation column. and so on.
3324	1	Denmark: Before the legislative elections on November 1, few candidates dare to offer relief to the conditions of reception of immigrants among the hardest in Europe, despite criticisms
3324	3	Shalini lives in a constant stress. To become a permanent resident, she must work at least three and a half years over four years before submitting her application. After two and a half years, I was dismissed. I knew that if I didn’t find a new job in six months, I would lose the years I had accumulated. If her husband is unemployed, she will be expelled. “I’m lucky because I can go to live elsewhere, but some remain in bad marriages because they don’t have the choice,” she says.
3324	5	Couples end up getting tired and leave Denmark, where it takes twelve years to get citizenship. Physiotherapist Miriam Thompson is one of the founders of the Fair Statsborgerskab! association, which advises candidates for naturalization. For more than three hours, through a video conference, she explains the details of a “Kafkaian” procedure. The rules change constantly, often retroactively.
3324	7	From 2021, for example, a prison sentence or with delay prevents the obtaining of Danish citizenship forever, regardless of the facts accused. Those who seek citizenship are also asked to list the least of their sins, at the risk of being accused of fraud. In 2018, the MPs decided to review 21,000 naturalizations. Some had cold sweats: having forgotten to declare an excess speed, they were threatened by a police investigation.
3324	9	For those who do not meet all the conditions, there is still one option: to appeal to the Parliament’s naturalization committee, composed of 17 members. But only 2% to 3% of the requests are completed. “Parliamentarians are not required to justify their decision,” said Thomas Borchert, German-Dutch journalist and co-founder of Fair Statsborgerskab! He describes a process “grotesque, stupid and random, intended to exclude as many people as possible, from certain origins and religions.” In an interview in November 2021, commission chairman Marie Krarup, a right-wing deputy, assumed to reject the demands of “Muslim” candidates.
3324	11	Since 2021, the bill classifies candidates into four categories, depending on their origin: the “Nordic”, the “Western”, the “Menap” (for Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan) and the “other non-Western”. Members vote on the full list, but the extreme right would want to organize a separate vote for the Menap. The naturalization is official only after the ceremony organized in the municipality, with mandatory hand. Faced with the complexity of the process, “many people end up wondering if they really want to belong to this club that doesn’t want them,” says Miriam Thompson. For young people born in Denmark, the effects are malicious: “They have always felt Danish, and suddenly they are asked to prove that they belong to society, what they thought obviously. This is not good for integration,” says Eva Ersboll.
3325	1	Social Media: A scientific study suggests that censorship is not effective and it only strengthens banal ideas
3325	3	The summary:
3325	5	In February 2020, the World Health Organization declared an “infodemia” related to COVID-19. This qualification makes sense that people are infected with “desinformation” as they would be by a virus. However, this metaphor carries a simplistic empirical understanding of communication, which can encourage responses in “information controls” mode. This article defends the importance of understanding the various factors that have an impact on the efficiency of communication – including the context in which it is received, and the emerging properties created by communication processes. By analyzing the activity on Facebook of “vaccin criticisms” in Australia between 1 December 2020 and 28 February 2022, we find that access control or censorship of the critical disinformation about the vaccine does not result in a reduction of the critical stories about the vaccine. On the contrary, the discussions continue on the basis of more defensive political and social arguments. In addition, the prohibitions disrupt Facebook users who criticize vaccines and encourage them to go to other platforms where they can radicalize themselves. It is important to note that recruitment on critical vaccine sites has accelerated as a result of the ban on “desinformation” and the introduction of vaccination obligations, suggesting that these answers can lead to increased dissatisfaction. As a result, we call on researchers, policy makers and platforms to engage in a more nuanced vision of communication, recognizing the powerful role of public uses and gratifications in determining the effectiveness of public health messages.

3327	3	The Quatennens and Bayou affairs shock the left. Some feminists ask themselves: Should they create a 100% feminist party?
3327	5	For a long time, La France Insoumise and Europe Ecologie-Les Verts have been seen, by many feminists, as the best-placed political vehicles to push their ideas. The recent affairs, and especially the reaction of cadres like Jean-Luc Melenchon, have come to question: are these parties really feminist? “We’re wondering,” the head of a collective confirms, which regrets that “our struggles are well carried only by ourselves.”
3327	7	"Psychological Violence: Julien Bayou ""instrumentalizes this case for political purposes"", says the lawyer of his ex-company"
3327	9	Should we create a feminist party? This is a repeated issue on the left. After Sandrine Rousseau failed at the primary ecologist, the temptation was already present. Feminist parties have existed in Belgium since the 1970s, in Sweden, recently in Spain. But in France there are only associative movements. Could the eco-feminism, more radical, go to seek a new electorate? To gather together, feminism should lift several barriers that prevent it from becoming an independent political force.
3327	11	Voyle, prostitution, trans: unbearable divisions among feminists
3327	13	"The first step is the ideological definition. Is there only one feminism? The historian Florence Montreynaud explains it very well: ""The feminist landscape is fragmented"" This historic activist describes three insurmountable divisions: prostitution, vessel, transgender. On these three points, the feminist currents are confronted, sometimes violently. This explains why Sandrine Rousseau was swept on Sunday during a protest in support of the Iranian women. It is sometimes considered pleasant with the Islamists on the vessel issue in France."
3327	15	"Another brake: a lack of confidence with the devices. “The parties are patriarchal and violent structures,” a associative official regrets. Struggles for power often result in the reduction of women’s role. But this does not prevent some activists from wanting to stay there: ""Without a relationship of force inside, nothing will change,"" says the Paris ecologist Raphaëlle Remy-Leleu, well determined to push the questions of equality within the EELV."
3327	17	"It is an enthusiasm that does not only make people happy. In the Greens, some executives would see almost with a good eye a split: ""They use ecology as a coke,"" a member of the federal council is troubled. The congress scheduled for December could clarify the line and, based on the results, restart the freedom of independence of the eco-feminists."
3328	1	Diseases, deaths, food insecurity... The consequences of global warming on health revealed by a study
3328	3	"The ""Lancet"" published this annual analysis conducted by 99 experts from 51 institutions, denouncing the world's excessive dependence on fossil energies, which causes climate change, which leads to harmful health effects."
3328	5	The heat wave that touches Europe this October seems to be a new demonstration: climate warming already hits the planet. How do we measure its impact on human health? This is the task to which a hundred scientists are dedicated to publishing their annual report (in English) on Tuesday 25 October in the British magazine The Lancet (PDF). “The health [is] at the grace of fossil energies,” they warn.
3328	7	“We see the serious impacts of climate change on health around the world, while the persistent global dependence on fossil fuels aggravates these harmful effects,” said Marina Romanello, executive director of the project at the University College of London, who supervised the work. Here are the main lessons.
3328	9	Populations much more exposed than before heat waves
3328	11	Scientists have developed 43 indicators in collaboration with 51 institutions, including the World Health Organization (WHO). They thus go to the cripture of data on health, economy, adaptation policies and the objectives of the States to reduce their CO2 emissions.
3328	13	The most obvious consequence of the climate crisis, the rise of temperatures, affects more and more people on the planet, the most risky. Thus, in the period 2012-2021, children under a year had to face an average of 4.4 days of canicule each year compared to the period 1986-2005. The figure is 3.2 additional days for people over the age of 65.
3328	15	High temperatures worsen some diseases
3328	17	High temperatures can cause heat strikes, but they also worsen cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. They also lead to deterioration of sleep and mental health.
3328	19	It also increases the risk of infectious diseases. Thus, the duration of malaria transmission increased by 31.3% in the altitude areas of North and South America between 2012 and 2021 compared to the period 1951-1960.
3328	21	Europe is not saved either. It has an increasingly favorable climate for mosquito-transmitted diseases such as dengue. Worldwide, the risk of transmission of dengue has increased by 12% over the period.
3328	23	Heat increases mortality
3328	25	The researchers are able to evaluate exactly the increase in mortality associated with these heat waves. The number of deaths was estimated at 68% in the period 2017-2021 compared to 2000-2004.
3328	27	The climate crisis kills us. It is harmful not only to the health of our planet, but also to the health of all its inhabitants (...) while addiction to fossil fuels becomes out of control,” the UN Secretary-General said. Antonio Guterres calls for investments in renewable energy and climate resilience. A year ago, the WHO estimated that between 2030 and 2050, 250,000 additional deaths per year would be due to climate change.
3328	29	Food insecurity is worsened by drought
3328	31	As the weather turns down, global warming increasingly fragilizes food safety. In 2020, 98 million more people suffer from food insecurity compared to the period 1981-2010.
3328	33	Scientists have managed to evaluate the consequences of increased temperatures on the increasingly shorter crop cycles. In a hundred countries, scientists calculated an average of 9.3 days less growth for corn, 1.7 days for rice, and 6 days for wheat.
3328	35	Extreme drought affected 29% more land areas in the period 2012-2021 compared to 1951-1960. “The drought causes risks to food and water access, threatens sanitation, affects the means of survival, and increases the risk of fires and the transmission of infectious diseases,” the Lancet report details.
3328	37	Political choices increase health crises
3328	39	The states contribute themselves to these health crises by subsidizing fossil energies, the researchers find. So, 69 of the 86 governments analyzed (i.e. 80%) subsidize the production and consumption of fossil fuels, for a net total of $400 billion in 2019.
3328	41	"""The carbon intensity of the global energy system [the sector that contributes most to greenhouse gas emissions] has decreased by less than 1% since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was established"" (1992) and ""at the current pace, a complete decarbonation of our energy system would take 150 years,"" the researchers say."
3328	43	“The current strategies of many governments and will lock the world into a fatally warmer future, linking us to the use of fossil fuels that quickly lock us the prospects of a viable world,” says Paul Ekins, Professor of Resources and Policy at the Bartlett School at the University College London.
3328	45	The authors therefore call for a “health-centered response”. Thus, improving air quality would prevent deaths resulting from exposure to fossil fuels, the number of which is up to 1.3 million for the year 2020. Furthermore, accelerating evolution to vegetable diets would reduce agricultural emissions by 55% and avoid up to 11.5 million food-related deaths per year.
3329	1	Did Greta Thunberg become favorable to nuclear power?
3329	3	Several political leaders have mentioned this change of opinion of the young activist. However, Sweden has not changed its opinion.
3329	5	"Did Greta Thunberg turn to nuclear power? This is what Francois Hollande says. The former head of state, invited from France 2, said he would like to ask this question to the young Swedish activist: ""Why is it now for nuclear power?"""
3329	7	“You have to take care of the little girl.”
3329	9	"It is not the only political leader to say that. Marine Le Pen also said from the banks of the National Assembly: ""I read this afternoon that their 15 and a half-year-old gourou just said that, in the end, she is for nuclear power. Thank you Mrs. Thunberg.”"
3329	11	Marine Le Pen talks about nuclear power by referring to Greta Thunberg at the Assembly pic.twitter.com/Veth3nsQKL
3329	13	We can also add several tribunes published in the French press that speaks of the turn-face of Greta Thunberg.
3329	15	The words of Greta Thunberg
3329	17	"But did the young activist really keep these words? No, Greta Thunberg has never said that she had ""changed opinion"" or that she was now ""favorable to nuclear power."" In fact, his statements were reversed."
3329	19	It all started from an interview she gave to Das Erste, a German television channel, a dozen days ago. During this twenty-minute interview, the journalist who asks him explains that the German government has just decided, in full energy crisis, to extend its last three nuclear power plants for several months and here is Greta Thunberg’s reaction: “If they are already in operation, I think it would be a mistake to stop them in order to turn to coal.” Getting on coal is a “bad idea,” she continues.
3329	21	Clearly, Greta Thunberg says it is better to turn nuclear power plants than coal plants, which are much more polluting and widely used in Germany, and even more in the last months since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, but she doesn’t say it has turned into nuclear power plants.
3329	23	Activists in favour of renewable
3329	25	"And the young activist has also denounced since the distortion of his statements. In a tweet, Greta Thunberg regrets that her words have come out of their context: ""We must be careful of those who listen to the truths that disturb only when it corresponds to their vision."""
3329	27	In the aftermath of this interview to German television, Greta Thunberg claims primarily for renewable energies.
333	1	Name of Birds and Bousculades in the Pro-IVG Manifesto: Progressive, Progressive and Half
333	3	Our bodies, our choices, your mouths. The tone is given, and it is not honestly open to the developed argumentation. On Wednesday evening, on the occasion of the World Day of the Right to the IVG, “a good thousand” people, according to Libé, “more than half” according to Inès Chopard, our local journalist, beat the Paris pavé to defend the right to abortion.
333	5	A right that, according to the protesters, would not always be guaranteed in France. However, in February last year, the vote of the Gaillot law acts the extension of the legal period of abortion from 12 to 14 weeks. But in the eyes of these feminists, that is still not enough. Then Célia swallowed her pancarte proudly: “I also had an abortion. She complains with Ines of the hundreds of kilometers that sometimes need to be passed to get access to the IVG and find it “scandalous” that nurses exercise their clause of consciousness. Having in mind the hardening of access to abortion in the United States or Hungary, they therefore demand, on the one hand, the constitutionalization of the right to abortion, and on the other hand demonstrate “their solidarity with all women around the world”. To do this, women scream their slogans in a micro, scratched on a truck next to what could look like a swollen sterile. Another one appears in the auréolate midst of a big red task, pancarte to the hand: “Avoring saved my life. »
333	7	On the margins of the demonstration, about twenty young people of Generation pro-vie are activated to defend the right of the youngest. Thro the convoy, they launch the pro-abortion slogans displayed on the walls.
333	10	If the feminists think very much about the peak of progress by protesting for these social advances, they are suddenly captured by more progressive than they are! The scene turns to surrealism. Radical activists are suddenly blurred and harassed by transidentitarian extreme-left youths who agitate with the sounds of “TERFs out of our struggles.” For memory, this neologism means Trans-exclusionary radical feminist, otherwise, the person who considers trans women as men (and, therefore, excludes them from the struggle for women’s rights). In summary, therefore, people are attended to demonstrate that men who have become women may have the right to abortion. The wokism in all its splendor.
333	12	This payout is obviously not enough, so the feminists have found a way to shake up with each other. Thus complaining to the organizers of the demonstration that they have not been protected from the aggressors, the tone has risen.
333	14	New sum returned to see the organizers asking them again to intervene and to exclude our aggressors in which case the attacks would continue.
333	16	And now, forgetting their common struggle, here is that all this beautiful world washes its dirty wash on Twitter.
333	18	"Finally, a great step for mankind consists, let’s remind it, with the deadline of fourteen weeks, to “destroy the fetus and crush its head,” explained Professor Israel Nisand in the FigaroVox. A medical gesture that the former president of the French National College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians describes as ""unsuitable for many professionals"". But as long as the feminists and all those who impose their new conception of femininity will beat the paved..."
3330	1	Climate: When Activists Degrade Art Works
3330	3	The Joconde, Van Gogh's Tournaments, The Coin Meals... These works have been the target of climate activists. Spectacular actions with a cake with cream or purée. Can climate emergency justify everything?
3330	5	“The time of words, it’s over, now it’s the time of action,” a climate activist says. Then another activist next to him throws a cake on the statue of King Charles III at the wax museum in London (United Kingdom), Monday 24 October. The Act is signed “Just stop oil” (Stop to fossil energies). On Sunday, it was a painting of Claude Monet worth 76 million euros that was covered by other German activists. “It will attract the attention but it will attract it in a bad way,” a man thinks. “I don’t know if art has anything to do with the subject,” another continues.
3330	7	“Moving the Fight”
3330	9	“Because, apparently, it doesn’t seem to be shocking, the fact that it makes 20 °C in Paris in October and 35 °C in the South, that we are attacking things that touch us more (...) it also has that value of visualizing that fight and that urgency to be carried out,” says Marie Chureau, ecologist activist. No work has actually been damaged because they are protected by windows.
3331	1	Pénuries: Macron decreasing, impotent and anxious president
3331	3	We may not have yet measured the extent of the great overthrow that constitutes the end of the abundance decreed by Emmanuel Macron, a month ago. And that has declined, this week, by the lunar presentation of the government’s sobriety plan by Elizabeth Borne, a plan that has already done “pschitt”, as Hervé Gattegno recognizes in The Point. Previously, politics presented action, production, and investment plans. From now on, our triade Macron-Borne-Le Maire, and all the other half-gods of macronism, have rave the political action to a vague Stoic wisdom, if we are gentle, or to the councils of memes who have known the war (they will forgive me). The macronism moves into the philosophy of the rolled col.
3331	5	What hits, in this evolution of the political current that has self-proclaimed “progress”, is paradoxically the absence of perspective, of “great intention”, as it was said before, of “project”, as it was still screaming in 2017. Even in relation to the Covid crisis, there is regression: faced with adversity, Emmanuel Macron had then promoted his confidence in science, the vaccine, renewing with a certain French tradition. Faced with the current crisis, the macronism is in dry break, dead point. As if we were condemned to a fate to Annie Ernaux, between the end of literature, social and manifest of October 16 with Mélenchon.
3331	7	But this week, France was crowned by another Nobel: Alain Aspect, in quantum physics. What France has always done best: provincial teaching center, ENS Cachan, Orsay, etc. It’s a very good way to get to that of Annie Ernaux. And this Nobel, which is so modest as charismatic, has just entrusted to the World one of the keys to the future, the lost puzzle of macronism: “My teaching parents have raised me in the belief that work must be done, and that science is part of progress. I am convinced that the climate crisis will not be solved without science. »
3331	9	Everything that seems to be forgotten by the macronism and its leader, who only swear by infantilisation, culpabilization, the rustines. And this rebounding of macronism and political action immediately, to the survival of the end of the month and how to pass the winter, in addition to the permanent anxiety it generates, constitutes a political fault.
3331	11	For Marian Tupy, a liberal researcher interviewed by The Express this week, Emmanuel Macron commits a majorly economic and almost anthropological mistake. His shock thesis, at the end of the macronic abundance, affirms, on the contrary, that we are in a period of “superabundance” and that demography is not an opponent but an ally to create wealth: “What worries us is that if the feeling of environmental apocalypse is rooted in society and people make less children because of fear of the end of the world, we will experience a population collapse that will lead to a decline in growth – there will be fewer inventions and in the end less means to fight climate change. »
3331	13	By the way, the essayist refers Macron to his own political mistakes that have created the current shortage, for example on nuclear: “Macron’s idea that the abundance would be ended therefore has no basis. This end of abundance could come because of political decisions, but not because of the limitations of human intelligence to find solutions. »
3331	15	Having taken responsibility for the current shortcomings on a paradigm change and on the irresponsibility of the French, Emmanuel Macron took the risk of increasing their anger towards him. Not only are they not fooled of this smoke curtain intended to hide his own responsibilities, but they are also entitled to blame him for his incapacity to invent the future. Dressing the decreasing president’s dress, Emmanuel Macron shows that he is failing as the manager of the moment and the future of France and the French. Passive for the one who, some say, dreams to be re-elected in 2032...
3332	1	Swedish elections: Multicultural disaster gives wings to Swedish Democrats
3332	3	A few days after the elections in Sweden, the “most dangerous country in Europe” for the German press, the Sweden Democrats (SD) became the second party in voting intentions, scoring 22% of popular support, which is 4% more than its 2018 election results. The Swedish Democrats is a national, conservative and social party that belongs to the ECR, the European Conservatives and Reformists group which includes Fratelli d’Italia and VOX. Known for its opposition to mass immigration, the party received the usual labels of “extreme right”, “ksenophobic” and “rasist”, and suffered a sanitary cord from other political parties. Saying that the king is naked has a high price.
3332	5	But the reality is hard and the situation has reached such a point that even the creators of the so-called “Swedish paradise”, the Social Democrats, now recognize its failure. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said in an interview with Dagens Nyheter that the ethnic ghettos of the big cities are a ground for organized crime: “We don’t want Chinatowns in Sweden, we don’t want ‘somalian villages’ or Small Italians.” A constatation of the failure of multiculturalism, even though, in reality, neither the Chinese nor the Italians are responsible for the shootings, rape and murders committed by gangs that are the bread and butter of the Nordic country. And, of course, neither the Chinese nor the Italians have to do with the application of sharia in increasingly major areas of the country.
3332	7	"Many have interpreted the Prime Minister's statement as a desperate attempt to ""stop the extreme right"" and to try to reduce the support for the anti-immigration measures of the Swedish Democrats. But the truth is that this is not the first time that Anderson acknowledges that progressive immigration policies have not worked. In 2017, while she was the Minister of Finance, Andersson regretted the decision of her government to allow 180,000 immigrants to settle in Sweden during the 2015/16 migration crisis:"
3332	9	“Integration does not work properly. It didn’t work until the autumn of 2015, but it’s obvious for me that we can’t have a number of asylum applications greater than we are able to integrate. This is not good for the people who come here, and it is not good for society in general.”
3332	11	Andersson’s latest statements have provoked the departure of the party of Saida Hussein Moge, the candidate of Somali origin in Gothenburg, who said the Social Democrats were “will become a more xenophobic party.” However, they go in the same direction as the Minister of Integration and Migration, Anders Ygeman, who said Sweden wanted to limit the concentration of people of immigrant origin in the most problematic areas of the cities. Despite this change, according to a recent survey, only 16 percent of Swedish people support the social-democratic immigration policy and only 9 percent the moderate party’s immigration policy. As we could expect, Swedish immigration policy was a major source of concern. No surprise, the most sustained immigration policy is that of the Swedish Democrats, with 35%. In the same survey in April, the support was 26%.
3332	13	In view of these figures, the social-democratic response has nothing surprising. Following the example of Joe Biden, Minister Ygeman and Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said at a press conference on Friday that the Swedish Democrats are a “threatening to the country’s security and foreign policy.” “There is no doubt that the links of the Swedish Democrats with Russia can pose a risk to Sweden’s security,” Ygeman said.
3332	15	The Social Democrats are lying.
3332	17	The Swedish Democrats, however, supported Sweden’s entry into NATO, leaving its position of neutrality after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And as to their views on Putin’s Russia, here is what their European deputy Charlie Weimers said to the European Parliament:
3332	19	“The Kremlin’s useful idiots are historically on the left. It is sad for me that some on the right side have shaken Putin’s featured conservationism. All conservatives should know that Putin is NOT a traditionalist bastion that opens the weak and “wained” West. Putin has built a bankrupt system. Systematic wins, corruption, murders, theft, lies, and now: send young Russians to die by killing their slaves brothers. Does Putin defend Christianity using Chechnya Islamist fanatics and Syrian mercenaries in Ukraine? Forcing 1.5 million people to leave their homeland and separating their families. Does this go in the sense of “family values” and respect for the love of his own home? What about the “love of the next”? Is the bombing of residential areas compatible with the command “You will not kill”? And wake up. The enemy of your enemies is not your friend. Imperialism is the antithesis of free nations.
3332	21	Using the map of Putin against the Swedish Democrats is completely absurd. The party leader, Jimmie Åkesson, replied in an article to this overwhelming press conference, emphasizing that the real danger for Sweden was the Social Democratic Party, a leftist party, favouring mass immigration: “We have seen a similar rhetoric from other autoritarian and powerful parties in the world. They are simply trying to spread fear, lies, and conspiracy theories about the opposition because they are afraid to lose power.”
3332	23	The surveys show a technical equality between the left and right blocks. On the left, the Social Democrats remain the first political force and are supported by the Greens, the Centre and the Left. In the right block, the Swedish Democrats would occupy the first place, followed by the Moderate Party, the Christian Democrats and the Liberal. So far, these parties have refused to form a coalition with national conservatives, but if the polls are confirmed and the Swedish Democrats get more than 20 percent, the other right-wing parties will have no choice but to seek an agreement if they really want to enter the government.
3333	1	Monarchy: Why England Understood Everything
3333	3	The popular emotional demonstrations in England, on the occasion of the death of the queen, find an echo here, though surdine. The message of the President of the Republic was at the height of the event: the theater, he knows how to do. The problem is not that; the problem is that it is all that he knows how to do. It doesn’t matter. In France, there are many citizens who have a real tenderness for the British royal family. They feel that their best enemies have lost a grandmother. This makes you close to families, despite the Brexit and the Calais migrants. We have good news at home. They incarnate the idea we make ourselves of England.
3333	5	But can you tell me what the British crown managed to maintain more than us? Diversity is the only criterion of the Truss government; “the wounds in the neck” are common currency; the Scots thought, not so long ago, to judge the statements held in private; the multicultural society is a disaster, the Commonwealth a failure and woke went to wish the queen to die in terrible pain. There is nothing to pavoise.
3333	7	The difference is not a difference of degree but of nature. The course of the world makes things bad, you see it perfectly. Everything will go worse until the last judgment, we know it very well. But we are not obliged, once the conclusion is made, to fall asleep while waiting for death to come to take us. Great Britain goes as bad as all the countries in the West decade, to a close difference: continuity.
3333	9	In France, there are immutable dynasties, in business, politics or newspapers, but not official, and pointing them with the finger would be conspiratory in the eyes of television. In Great Britain, all this is codified, protocolary, and above all not immutable, since the queen continued, and that the king will continue, to renew her nobility. In France, as Balzac said, the head of all the fathers of the family was cut by the king's head. The fraternity of the Republican motto (outside its obvious Masonic connotation): an assembly of brothers without a father, a coward without a head. In the British, everything can go to the water, and it hasn’t missed since 1952, but there has been on the bar, for 70 years, this shy and gracious young woman, becoming a touching and worthy old lady, solidly rooted in the earth with her Wellies, her Land Rover which led to every blind and her dogs. The governments went and came, the people were replaced, the greatness of what was the British Empire collapsed in whole: Elizabeth II remained in office, as she had sworn when she was only a royal princess of twenty years. It was an exciting promise at the time, which seems to us now shocking. The whole reign of this great sovereign is held in this few minutes video recording. Everything reigns, but also the secret of British royalism and its timeless side: a lifelong promise between a leader and a people; relations between people and not between “the Republic” and “all and all”.
3333	11	The power is made to be incarnated. Elizabeth II did the job, without complaining, without being justified. What is the difference between our two schemes? Nothing. And all.

3334	5	The sanctions against Russia: a hidden economic war against Europe?
3334	7	In response to the invasion of Ukraine, the most severe economic sanctions in history have been imposed on Russia. It is the West Europe, but above all Germany, who must bear the greatest of these measures, while the United States is only little affected. Could the anti-Russian policy be, like during the First and Second World War, a skillful maneuver of the American policy to bring out again great winners?
3334	9	In response to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Western politicians imposed on Russia the strictest economic sanctions in history, announcing as a consequence the upcoming collapse of the Russian economy. As Russia is indifferent and still continues the war, even Ukrainian President Zelensky now regrets the lack of effectiveness of sanctions against Russia.
3334	11	In Western Europe, their effectiveness is clearly perceived. Energy prices explode, inflation reaches a record level and European stock markets and the euro collapse. The latter has fallen to its lowest level compared to the dollar in 20 years, which, according to economic experts, constitutes a dramatic and unique evolution. This collapse is a direct consequence of the lack of energy in the EU. In May 2022, for the first time in 30 years, Germany’s imports exceeded its exports due to the energy crisis. The European trade balance also has a significant deficit, which already leads to massive problems for the German and European economy.
3334	13	However, these are only the direct consequences of the Russian sanctions. Their medium and long-term effects are even more dramatic and threaten the existence of. According to the financial and economic expert Folker Hellmeyer, the current sanctions are equivalent to a self-destruction of Western Europe.
3334	15	According to Hellmeyer, profitable energy supply security is the key to new investments. These represent an existential importance for stabilizing a country’s capital reserves. The building, machinery and technical facilities of a national economy, used for production, must be constantly modernized and replaced by new investments in order to maintain or improve productivity and competitiveness. In the absence of these investments, a country is inevitably poor. Hellmeyer compares capital reserves to a tree of life, a source of prosperity for all of us. If the sanctions adopted had to hurt this tree, Hellmeyer predicts economic damage as we have not seen since 1949.
3334	17	The collapse of the euro and the European stock markets should be a warning signal for the policy. If not heard, the European economy risks to suffer irreparable damage.
3334	19	Faced with these dark prospects of the future, if we turn to the United States, the picture is quite different. While the natural gas price has been multiplied by 40 in Europe since the beginning of the 2020s, it has not even tripled in the United States. This shows that Western Europe, and especially Germany, must suffer the main burden of sanctions against Russia due to their dependence on energy imports and the current flamming energy prices. The United States, on the contrary, is little affected due to its own large oil and gas reserves.
3334	21	Former CIA collaborator Graham E. Fuller assesses this inequal allocation of charges as follows:
3334	23	“The U.S. sanctions against Russia have proved much more devastating for Europe than for Russia. The day will come when Western Europe will bitterly regret having blindly followed the American flotta player in his war against Russia. »
3334	25	According to the financial and geopolitical analyst Martin Armstrong, the situation has returned to the same as in the First and Second World War. At that time, the European economic place had been massively weakened, while the money that had been invested in Europe so far was going to the United States. Before the First World War, the United States was almost in bankruptcy. After the war, as a result of the money flows, they had replaced Britain as a world financial place.
3334	27	With the Second World War, the United States acquired 76% of the world’s gold reserves, allowing the dollar to become the world’s reserve currency. The United States is the biggest winner of all conflicts in Europe.
3334	29	Could the current anti-Russian Western policy be a new skilled maneuver of the U.S. policy? The indicators speak in any case in this sense: Russia is militarily weakened by a significant military support to Ukraine, while at the same time the EU is eliminated as a powerful economic competitor and the U.S. economy in trouble is healthier.
3334	31	Unfortunately, the governments and the media of the European states do not question the doubtful utility of the sanctions imposed and even seem to approve the massive damage to their own economy, which actually resembles, as Hellmeyer describes, a self-destruction of Europe.
3334	33	The fact that European governments and media leave the public in ignorance of the serious consequences of the Western sanctions policy is a crime against the people. It is obvious that the well-being of the population is sacrificed to foreign interests. When such things happen, the people must make their voice heard and demand a broad public debate to force responsible politicians to change their direction.

3335	1	In Cuers (Var), the surprising installation of a migrant home creates controversy
3335	3	The list of cities affected by the forced settlement of migrants is extending. It is now supplemented by Cuers, a municipality of 12,000 inhabitants located between the Green Provence and the sea. On Thursday 29 September, Mayor Bernard Mouttet put the topic on the table at the municipal council... without even being specified this question on the agenda! A surprise that the Cuersois have not all appreciated, especially regreting the lack of transparency of the mayor on this topic that directly affects them.
3335	5	Joint by Boulevard Voltaire, Yann Bizien, who has lived in Cuers for a quarter of years, says: “Cuers is a city in trouble. There is no high school, schools and kindergartens are saturated. There is a lot of unhealth, unhealth, there is a lot of drug trafficking. Many people are close to the euro. This weakness is added to the home with its potential lot of violence and crime. People don’t want it. The Cuersois came here to be quiet, between the countryside and the olive trees. Today they want to leave. In the future, all of this can cause the price of the real estate to fall. “It is he, a simple citizen, who has warned the Cuersois of the presence of this new home yet installed since July,” he says. After seeing youth bands out of the Fasthotel in the periphery, he approached it to have its heart clear, last week. The new arrivals confirmed the change in nature of the hotel’s activity.
3335	7	Pierre-Laurent Chable, municipal counsel of the opposition (RN), confirms this version. It was by Yann Bizien that the elected learned the installation of the new home. Pierre-Laurent Chable strongly denounces the satisfaction of the local authorities. “There is a lack of problematic transparency,” he explains, the departmental services, the prefecture... everyone is aware and nothing is done. The mayor has allegedly launched an action in court to denounce this illegal installation, but there is in reality a laissez-faire, no vigorous action is launched to make the law respect. »
3335	9	Both see the change of face of this city where it was good to live before. “The atmosphere in the center has changed radically, says Pierre-Laurent Chable. Insults, threats and theft of scooters have become common currency, it becomes unbearable for the inhabitants. There is a slow breakdown in the city centre. Yann Bizien denounces, he, “a strongly communalized historical center over the past fifteen years with the opening of a cultural center for Muslims.” And adding: “I see a great level of exhaust. Coers cannot be a center of ethnic ghettoization. If there was a local referendum, the mayor would have lost and we would not have that project. We can no longer oppose it now that it is in place, while it is illegal. »
3335	11	The local elected members of the National Assembly, however, do not intend to leave the case and Frank Giletti, RN member of the sixth district of Var, intends to defend the identity and security of the village. “We’ve brought the contradiction in the municipal council, we’ll make a petition, try to get heard,” said Pierre-Laurent Chable, who is also his parliamentary attachment. Medium peripheral cities are taken for rubbish. We’re going to get to the prefect to have an explanation of the true course of the things. After Callac, fast, Saint-Lys or Cuers, what will the next city be?
3336	1	Racism in Italy: poison is not over
3336	3	The scene takes place in early September, in the center of Florence. Wiped head, in shirt arms, mafia sun glasses on the nose, Alessio di Giulio, municipal counselor of the extreme right-wing populist party La Ligue, films with his phone next to a Rom woman... and sits with a great smile: “Do you want to see her anymore? On the 25th of September, vote for the League and you won’t see it anymore. »
3336	5	More seriously, a few weeks earlier, Alika Ogorchukwu, a Nigerian street seller (also disabled, moving with a bag) was hit to death, early afternoon, in the center of Civitanova Marche, a tourist city of the Marches region, on the Adriatic coast. An aggression of a rare 4-minute violence, in general indifference, as shows the images that circulated on social networks. If they did not call for help, the witnesses took time to film.
3336	7	This is the atmosphere in which the last Italian elections took place. In these conditions, can we really be surprised by the victory of the right/extreme right alliance? Although, unfortunately, we have been accustomed for a long time to the xenophobic outrances of Salvini, Berlusconi and Meloni, this decomplexed, rampant racism has something to ice... especially because it has not raised, in each of these cases, large-scale opposition demonstrations.
3336	9	In Italy, this racism towards black or maghrib people is relatively recent. “We had no strangers at home,” reminds Erri de Luca, Italian writer and poet. For a long time, until the 1970s, we were a land of emigration. The inhabitants of our ancient colonies had no idea to come to settle here. There was, of course, the recovery of the colonial ideology of the other European countries of the supremacy of the white race. But it was far from us. »
3336	11	But if you imagine an Italy like the Garden of Eden where all human beings live in harmony with their differences and complementarities... you are immediately stopped! There are no strangers that can be identified as enemies. No matter what, the Northern Italians, richer and more industrialized, found a “other” to reject: the Southern Italians, the “teronians”, literally the “cuts-terreals”, these poor peasants from the bottom of the boat. “It will be theoretized by scientists, for example the anthropologist Lombroso or the statistical sociologist Niceforo,” explains Marie Anne Matard Bonucci, a contemporary history researcher associated with Sciences Po, an Italian fascist. “They will develop the thesis that, for genetic reasons, the southern population would be lower. And these anti-mortem predictions will remain. It has become cultural.” Erri de Luca, from Naples, personally suffered this: “When I was a worker in Turin, in front of the house where I lived, there was a pancarte saying, ‘We don’t rent the Naples.’ We found the same antimeridional posters in front of the bars for example. »
3336	13	This is how the 20th century passes in Italy, in this particular atmosphere... but without the question of the “real stranger” being really raised. And the myth of “Bravo Italiano” is gradually developing. “It is the idea that would want the Italian by nature and because he is Christian to be naturally warm, good, welcoming, by principle,” says Michela Marzano, Italian philosopher, professor at the University of Paris Descartes. “So there would be no question... In fact, the Italian people are not different from the others. We also had our racial laws, and even before that, the prohibition of metisage, which would have challenged the so-called purity of the so-called Italian race. »
3336	15	For although it began late, at the beginning of the 20th century, Italian colonial history well existed. With so much more violence that it was delayed. “There was this speech, especially of fascism, that Italy also had the right to its part of the cake, instead of the sun,” says Marie Anne Matard Bonucci. This is what we called the poor imperialism: the proletarian Italian nation needed colonies to feed its population. The other Nantes countries had to leave their share. And this is how Italy has both well and badly colonized Libya, Eritrea, Somalia and part of Ethiopia. With all the joy that accompanies the conquest: extreme aggressiveness, massacres of civilians, the use of gas in violation of international commitments... Part of the story that a lot of the Italians themselves do not know. “The problem with Italy is that it’s a country without memory,” said Michela Marzano. “People don’t want to remember. Amnesty is the general amnesty. I can testify, I only discovered at the age of 50 that my grandfather had been a convinced fascist. And I am not the only one. But we hide it, we don’t talk about it, we don’t discuss it. As a result, yet today, there are a number of Italians who consider that Mussolini did good things and that he missed because of Hitler. It is nevertheless incredible! But as long as we do not face our past, we will not be able to digest it. »
3336	17	The other problem of Italy in terms of racism would be that it has long been saved by... racism. “Unlike other European countries, there has long been no anti-Semitic or xenophobic conservative political party,” says Marie Anne Matard Bonucci. Add to this the absence of foreigners... and you will understand why it has not developed anti-racist movement or thought as it may be in France with the MRAP, the Licra or SOS Racism. So when racist acts or words began to become more common, the Italians found themselves poor. A little like a organism that has never been confronted with pathogens and therefore has not been able to develop the immune defences necessary to resist microbes.
3336	19	Italy is faced more directly with racism. When from the 1970s to the 1980s, this country of immigration began to welcome its first immigrants. And there, this people who personally experienced xenophobia and rejection, in France or in the United States in particular, suddenly passed on the other side of the mirror. “It’s a banal story,” Erri De Luca regrets. “They forgot that they were immigrants until a few decades earlier. They have passed the sponge on the past, as do all those who have improved their economic and social situation. And the more visible arrival of exiles on the Italian coasts since the beginning of the 2010s has only strengthened this trend. And release a little more this decomplexed rejection from the other. With Matteo Salvini and the League first. And now with Giorgia Meloni and Fratelli of Italy. “We will enter an era where it will become banal to say everything loudly,” says Michela Marzano. Even the most shocking things. The great fear of the left-wing people is that in Italy, we are passing from amnesia to the horrors of our past, to their amnesia. »
3337	1	In honor of the Queen, the new Prime Minister Liz Truss fixed the age of retirement to 96 years
3337	3	"Britain's Prime Minister Liz Truss said: ""Our sovereign deceased has proved one thing, that the value of work was not age, that at 96 years we were still perfectly able to take on a professional activity. I think, in honor of her, the least thing is to do like her: work up to 96 years old. On the other hand, at the age of 97, it will obviously be time to rest a little.”"
3337	5	A large part of the British opinion welcomed this news with euphoria: “Nothing is too beautiful for our Queen, so if she looks at us from above, I want to make her pleasure and continue the job until 96 years old! Finally, if I keep up to that, given that I already have a breath in the heart and rheumatisms,” William, a 37-year-old metallurgist, suffered in Brighton.
3337	7	However, some dissonant voices dare to rise against this next law, such as Chelsea, a 42-year-old London woman: “I’m shocked! I love the Queen, but I will see myself working more like King Charles III. That is, I don’t do anything in my life and start working at the age of 73. Everyone should do that, finally “everyone” except the bosses of pubs of course! “She leaves it by ending her dry ass beer before she goes to her office.
3338	1	63% of French people plan to put back a mask this winter to warm up
3338	3	Faced with the shortage, the French are ready to show themselves responsible but not at any price. If many of them have already followed the example of Bruno Le Maire and broke a rolled collar, they are aware that this may not be enough. According to an IFOP survey for the Le Point newspaper, they are therefore 63% considering to put a mask back this winter, an initiative facilitated by the number of unused masks that remained on their arms, 411 per home in average according to a study. 52% of respondents plan to put two, one in fabric, and 31% think to keep them to sleep. According to the same survey, 43% of the French will stop telecommunications “to benefit from the company’s heating.”
3338	5	A constructive investigation
3338	7	The survey reveals that our citizens already have a very precise idea of all the activities they will put in place to fight the cold. So, 73% of them consider cooking exclusively in the oven to heat the room. 25 percent are planning to wear a cagoule in the living rooms. More surprising, 58% of the respondents are decided to take Christmas races on December 24, preferably at the FNAC, “to give themselves a good sweat.”
3338	9	"Finally, 38% of the French are determined to do everything to contract the Covid ""to be warm at the hospital. »"

3339	1	Vladimir Putin withdraws troops from Ukraine after he learned about the presence of BHL
3339	3	Vladimir Putin announced the withdrawal of his troops from Ukraine this morning. In question: the presence of the philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy on the site. “A man capable of coming in a white shirt on a war zone is capable of everything,” he laconically explained at a press conference organized for the occasion. Then the head of the Kremlin added: “It’s a thing to have weapons and men, but it doesn’t do everything. You must be honest, you can’t fight your charism. »
3339	5	The Capitulation
3339	7	In addition to the announced defeat, the Russian president seemed affected by failing against stronger than him. “It’s very hard for me to recognize it, but I found it crazy and more determined than me. Asked about whether his decision was definitive, Vladimir Putin showed himself categorical: “I won’t return to my decision, this man has sowed desolation and chaos everywhere he has passed. I do not want Russia to become the new Libya. »
334	1	The notion “left/right” must be replaced by the scheme “post-west/pro-west”
334	3	Apparently, the political notion left/right dates from the 1789 French Revolution; the representatives of the future order were sitting on the left in the parliamentary assembly while the representatives of the former order were sitting on the right. Later, as a result of the western domination of the planet, the political terms “left” and “right” were used throughout the world. Though over time, the definition of “left” and “right” has evolved somewhere, we want to keep here the original understanding, i.e., left=representatives of the future order and right=representatives of the old order.
334	5	Today we are in the middle of a world revolution. The western domination of the planet reaches its end and is replaced by a new order. It is only logical that political forces should be differentiated accordingly. So the right forces are the forces that defend the old order, that is, who want the West to remain the dominant force of the planet. On the other hand, the left forces support that the new order stabilizes and takes shape; I want to call this new order post-western.
334	7	On February 20, 2017, at the Security Conference in Munich, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used the term post-West’ world order in his speech. Before, this term was practically unknown (I myself published an article entitled Post-Western Thought in November 2016). The French media had translated it as “post-western world order”. It can also be remembered that in March 2021, the Journal of National Defense (France) was published under the general title We entered the post-Western era?
334	9	"The Russians, Chinese and others often talk about a multipolar world. It can be said that, in our scheme, it is the position of the center, between left and right. If, in addition, the conception of a multipolar world is explicitly opposed to the idea of a one-polar world, I would speak of a center-left position. Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech at the 10th International Legal Forum in St. Petersburg (30 June 2022) is a typical example of this: ""A multipolar system of international relations is being actively formed. This process is irreversible, it takes place in front of our eyes and it is objective. In short, the domination of a country or group of countries on the world scene is not only counterproductive, but also dangerous and inevitably creates a global systemic risk. The multipolar world of the 21st century has no place for inequality or discrimination against states and peoples.”"
334	11	Let us continue to differentiate our model. I see an anti-Western position, which claims that everything that comes from the West is to be condemned by principle, as an extreme left position that I do not share. I would say that a position of the left defends a multipolar world, but, in addition, adopts the point of view that there are already countries with a better system than the Western model. A position that accepts that other power centers exist and, in principle, respects the independence of other countries, while preferring the Western model is a center-right position. On the other hand, as already said, the right position wants to keep the supremacy of the West. And I would talk about the extreme right if we want to actively change the direction other countries have chosen. In particular, illegal use (i.e. without the authorization of the United Nations) of sanctions to change the system established in another country is an extreme right-wing attitude.
334	13	Today, the ancient use of the terms “left” and “right” generally gives a misleading, even absurd result. For example, the current German government is, according to the former use, a central-left government. However, it is obvious that it is a right-wing government, or even the extreme right. Or French President Emmanuel Macron has, in fact, much more right-wing positions than his rival in the last election Marine Le Pen. But during the elections in Italy on 25 September [this text was written before 25 September], a victory is expected by the Fratelli d’Italia party with La Liga and Forza Italia. These parties are classified by most Western media as right-wing or extreme-right parties. However, in fact, the outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi is much more right than these parties; it is just because of his anti-Russian policy, including huge illegal sanctions (which have greatly increased economic problems in Italy), that Draghi was pushed to resign by the popular resistance. As for the results of the recent elections (11 September) in Sweden, a similar analysis is required.
334	15	On the other hand, the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Liz Truss, is, according to the old use as well as according to the new use, very close to the extreme right, but is not considered as the extreme right by the Western media; the latter is, in parentesis, so often very close to the extreme right. The same media classifies Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as an extreme right-wing man, while in reality, Orban is probably the most moderate prime minister of all EU countries.
334	17	In Switzerland, traditional neutrality can be considered a center-right position. However, the Swiss government, supported by most political parties, has joined the illegal sanctions of the West against Russia. Therefore, a number of countries, including Russia, do not most consider Switzerland a neutral country and a meeting between Putin and Biden like that of June 16, 2021 in Geneva will no longer be possible in Switzerland. In addition, there is now a trend in Switzerland that openly wants to redefine neutrality as pro-Western neutrality. This would be a shift to the right of Switzerland. The last word is not yet said and we will see how Switzerland will position itself given that traditional neutrality remains popular, especially in the so-called “conservative” environments and regions.
334	19	In the West, the word “democracy” has become a mythical, or even religious term. However, the Western model has never been based on the principle that all countries are sovereign and have the same rights. In general, when a U.S. president visits another country, he doesn’t miss to give the lesson to that country and tell him how he should behave. So, traditionally, the Western model is based on the principle of “democracy inside, dictatorship outside.” However, this model does not work anymore. In recent years, democracy within the Western countries has also weakened considerably.
334	21	The words that are used to classify political positions have a significant influence. It is absolutely crucial where the political center is located and which is considered extremist and which is considered moderate. The old concepts are no longer adapted and must be replaced.
3340	1	To earn more, Pap Ndiaye advises teachers to change the profession
3340	3	“I’m proud to finally announce that the faculty has unlocked a way to increase their level of life: change of profession. That’s why I’m going to put all the means of National Education to help teachers change their way as soon as possible,” the Minister of Education, Pap Ndiaye, said.
3340	5	“Let’s be realistic, a teacher will never earn his life well by teaching. We are already unable to offer them material, pencil, paper, ink, class heating, computers... So a good salary... Oh that would be the best! “The minister continues with a laugh.
3340	7	Melodie, a member of the SNES-FSU syndicate, considers this measure not sufficient: “One time again the ministry takes care of us! This will take a few months and nothing will change. We do not demand an increase in the salary of teachers, but also to receive the other salaries of the other professions that we are brought to practice, namely educators, nurse surveillers, nurses and social assistants.”

3341	1	To fight gender stereotypes, Pap Ndiaye promises that male teachers will be as badly paid as women
3341	3	Worrying about fighting gender stereotypes in school, the Minister of Education Pap Ndiaye made a great announcement in which he promises perfect equality between men and women: “I’m proud to carry the great reform of this new five-year year, making teachers men as badly paid as women! It is my priority to bring school and progressism back.”
3341	5	The news caused vibrant reactions among the faculty, as Annabelle, 32 years old, member of the SNES teachers’ syndicate confirms: “This is an immense progress for our profession. We saw too many men flaming with Celio clothes, from La Halle shoes to shoes or even riding on Twingo occasionally. At least, we are all on a foot of equality.”
3341	7	Sophie, a 27-year-old teacher, has been to the angels since Pap Ndiaye’s announcement: “We were equal in the number of burn out, depression and suicides, it was normal to be financially! And, honestly, in the teacher’s room, it makes more common stories to be told. Like the months when we can’t pay our rent, nor invite our spouse to the rest... We can even share the good plans of small bullets to do after the courses to round the end of the month! In other words, I let you, I have to jump on my bicycle, I have a boe bún to deliver,” Sophie says.

3342	1	Pension reform – Emmanuel Macron favors the advancement of several years of death age
3342	3	Working more or living less? This is the dilemma on which Emmanuel Macron and Olivier Dussopt are facing. According to their surroundings, the two men would be increasingly convinced by the second solution, an idea, directly drawn from a study published by several Syrian scientists that a death would cost sixteen times cheaper to the taxpayer than a retireer. In addition to the billions of economies planned, the adjustment of the age of death would help preserve the pension system without having to start a social iron arm with the syndicates.
3342	5	For many doctors, the importance of calculating the legal age of death remains very often underestimated in France. “Death often occurs too late, at a time when the health conditions are already largely deteriorated,” says Dr. Paidre, director of the Geratry Service at the Fernand-Widal Hospital in Paris.
3342	7	Olivier Dussopt appointed in all discretion Gérard Larcher to the head of a working group to work on the establishment of criteria of painfulness of life in order to find a right calculation grid to best assess the age of death. According to the minister, the announced goal is not only economic but also to enable every French to better benefit from death.

3343	3	"Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova replied to Zelensky's statements that Kiev has not received a penny for the reconstruction of the country, saying that ""until now, Ukraine has only received it to destroy the country."""
3343	5	The Ukrainian authorities only receive money from Europe to destroy the country. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on the statements of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
3343	7	So far, the Kiev regime is only receiving money for the destruction of Ukraine. When the West considers that the country is sufficiently ruined, then another story will begin. Not just reconstruction, but sharing the remains,” the Russian diplomat wrote on her Telegram channel.
3343	9	Vladimir Zelensky, during his speech at an international conference, which was dedicated to financial assistance to Ukraine, said that Kiev had not received a single penny for the implementation of the country’s fast reconstruction plan, a amount of $17 billion.
3344	1	Stones, degradations, black blocks: tensions on the margins of the demonstration in Paris
3344	3	Vandalised and kidnapped stores, stones and paves, tags on the walls... A demonstration once again experienced tensions in Paris. This Tuesday, October 18 is marked by a widespread strike throughout France, affecting several sectors such as energy, transport and education. And this, to demand a salary increase in the face of galopant inflation and while refineries have been blocked for several weeks for the same claims. The Ministry of the Interior has counted 107,000 participants in France, of which 13,000 in Paris.
3344	5	Meetings have been held in the country, especially in Paris. The courtier departed from the place of Italy around 14h, then riding up the boulevards Raspail and Montparnasse. He finished his journey in Vauban Square, in the 7th district. In any case, warms have occurred, it seems due to the presence of antifa protesters within the cortège. According to images from the Boulevard Voltaire, this slogan would have been scanded by members of the crowd: “Low the state, the police and the façades. “People also did not hesitate to throw stones and paves on the forces of law.
3344	7	There were brokers in the cottage. In particular, the vitrines were broken. BFMTV broadcasts the images of a BMW concession being vandalised after cagoulated individuals broke the glass. The police prefecture in Paris told the news channel that a black block of 200 people was detected. About 60 ultra-left activists have been identified by the prefecture. Police have arrested 11 people in Paris, the Interior Ministry said. The number is up to 15 at the national level. A total of nine police officers were injured in France, eight of them in Paris. No protesters were injured.
3345	1	Russia: Kremlin wants to strengthen its law against “homosexual propaganda” among minors
3345	3	The Kremlin is not ready to relieve its conservative line. On Monday, 17 October, the Russian parliamentarians announced their willingness to strengthen the 2013 law against “homosexual propaganda” among minors. As Le Figaro said, this text would create a ban on “negation of family values” and “the promotion of non-traditional sexual orientations.” In full conflict with Ukraine, therefore, Russia does not least forget its internal battles. Alexander Khinstein, head of the Douma Information Committee, even believes that “the special operation takes place not only on the battlefield, but also in the minds and souls of people.”
3345	5	Ukraine: Vladimir Putin swears to regain the territories recovered by Kiev

3345	9	The billionaire and ultra-conservative Konstantin Malofeev, on his side, has assured that “sodomic propaganda is truly at the heart of (their) enemy’s influence.” President Viatcheslav Volodine mentioned a law aimed at “protecting” the Russians. The Russian parliament is expected to approve this hardening of the text in the autumn. Vladimir Putin has announced the unlocking of 4 billion rubles – 64 million euros – for patriot and educational purposes. Themes that the Kremlin has only strengthened since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.
3346	1	Euthanasia: toward a recession of Macron?
3346	3	At the end of the interview of an hour in the Vatican on Monday morning, Macron told the Pope:
3346	5	“I don’t like talking about euthanasia. Death is not a technical matter. What is at stake is the dignity of life.”
3346	7	While he had promised to Line Renaud a law on active aid to die, the president now tries to calm: he claims that he has resisted throughout his first five years to the pressure out of his majority:
3346	9	“I’ve never talked about euthanasia. But there are cases of consciousness that come up, when there is no longer hope, pain and disappearance. There are no framework for these families. We need to provide them with the means of an intimate and unique meeting.”
3346	11	Favorable to the “Belgium model” in April last year, it is now more nuanced.
3346	13	“There are two deviations in the Belgian model: the minors, and those who have no judgment anymore.”
3346	15	This is the natural deviation of euthanasia: once we have crossed the border, there is no longer a limit.
3346	17	Is it necessary to make a new law? Macron acknowledges the risk of a “form of parliamentary hibride” and makes it clear that on the principle of a law, it is he who, in the end, will decide “to go or not”. There are more “adaptations” to the current law. He insists on the need to take the necessary time, while he had mentioned the end of 2023 as a butoir date.
3347	1	"Covid-19: Former Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn had ""prevished"" but ""all were missing it"""
3347	3	The former government member was investigated for his management of the first weeks of the Covid-19 epidemic.
3347	5	"“I had not only seen, but warned.” Examined for her management of the first weeks of the Covid-19 epidemic, former health minister Agnès Buzyn says she has alerted since January 2020 Emmanuel Macron and Edouard Philippe, but that she had ""not the impression of being heard"", according to elements published on Tuesday 25 October in Le Monde (article reserved for subscribers)."
3347	7	"“I’ve been, far from Europe, the most alert minister. But everyone was worried of it,"" she insisted according to statements by the newspaper, which says she had access to a newspaper written by the former minister during the pandemic. The World reports many texts addressed to the head of state and to its former prime minister, the first on January 11, 2020, about the epidemic that appeared in China, which then does not appear ""not yet in the media"" but which ""can rise,"" she writes."
3347	9	“I felt that I was no longer weighing anything and that I was talking in the empty.”
3347	11	Despite these elements, “I didn’t feel like I was heard,” adds Agnès Buzyn, who “no managed to have a meeting” with the President of the Republic, until a telephone interview on February 8. It was a week before he left the ministry to replace Benjamin Griveaux in the racing to the mayority of Paris. “I’t have ever had to leave,” she says, adding that “they were pushing to the wrong place at the wrong time.”
3347	13	"Until her cooking defeat in the second round, she continued to warn the executive. This message on February 29 to Emmanuel Macron: “We’re losing time on the epidemic (...) The country is not ready!“” Or even this, on March 10, at Edouard Philippe, to whom she orders “to stop everything, as in Italy, as soon as possible”, predicting that “this will be the berézina in the hospitals”. “I felt that I didn’t weigh anything anymore and I spoke in the empty. I was no longer in the business and they made me feel,"" she added today in speeches to the World."
3348	1	OPEC has reduced its production by 2 million barrels. The oil prices are rising!
3348	3	This is not a good news for the world economy.
3348	5	In fact, OPEC has reduced its daily quotas by two million barrels, which is the biggest coup since 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic.
3348	7	The OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) member states, meeting on Wednesday 5 October in Vienna (Austria), decided to draconically cut their production quotas to support prices affected by the fears of recession. Thirteen OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, and their ten partners, led by Russia, agreed to a drop of “two million” barrels per day for November, the alliance announced in a statement.
3348	9	Without surprise, the news caused a ice reaction from Washington. Joe Biden is “disappointed by the OPEC’s short-looking decision,” according to a statement released on Wednesday by the White House. “The U.S. president has been trying for months to stop the price flows that erod the purchasing power of households, even going to Riyadh in July during a very controversial visit.”
3348	11	The last big “green” candle on the price chart is the price rise of the barrel linked to this announcement.
3348	13	The rates rise.
3348	15	Oil remains high and OPEC countries don’t want to see prices collapse as in every recession. It is highly likely that they will continue to reduce production based on the decrease in economic activity to keep the barrel between $80 and $100.
3348	17	Producing countries do not want to burn their last drops of oil.
3349	1	and Ukraine. The evacuation of civilians from the Kherson region is completed, according to a pro-Russian official
3349	3	According to Sergei Aksionov, the leader of Crimea, the evacuation of civilians from the Kherson region is completed. Ukraine calls these transfers “deportations”.
3349	5	The evacuation of civilians from the Kherson region in southern Ukraine, occupied by Russia and facing an Ukrainian offensive, is completed, a pro-Russian official said.
3349	6	“The work is finished”
3349	8	“The work to organize the departure of the inhabitants of the right shore of the (the river) Dnipro to secure regions in Russia is completed,” said Sergei Aksionov, the leader of Crimea, the adjacent peninsula of Kherson annexed in 2014 by Moscow.
3349	10	Ukraine, which is carrying out an offensive in the region after inflicting serious reverses to the Russian forces on other fronts, calls these population transfers “deportations.”
3349	12	“I am happy that those who wanted to leave the territory bombed by the Ukrainian armed forces quickly and safely were able to do so,” Aksionov said on Telegram, publishing a photo alongside the deputy director of the Russian presidential administration Sergei Kirienko.
3349	14	On Wednesday, a Russian occupation official in Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, said at least 70,000 residents had left their homes in the region in less than a week.
3349	15	The “deportation” of Kiev
3349	17	The Ukrainian military command said in its daily report on the last 24 hours published on Friday that “the so-called evacuation of the temporarily occupied territory of the Kherson region is ongoing.”
3349	19	He noted a “enemy group strengthening on the right shore” of the Kherson region.
3349	21	Aksionov also said he visited with Mr. Kirienko the Zaporijjia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia and repeatedly targeted by dangerous bombings for which Moscow and Kiev reject responsibility. “The two men met the staff and evaluated the situation in the power plant area,” Aksionov said.
335	1	The European Union is becoming a military alliance.
335	3	20 October 2022
335	5	Brussels aims to increase the combat capacity of the Ukrainian army. The European Council has decided to set up a military assistance mission to support Ukraine (EUMAM Ukraine). With his help, Ukrainian soldiers will be trained in managing the weapons supplied by the West to their country. This is how the functioning of the European Union itself changes.
335	7	Through the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, the EU is becoming more and more, from a purely non-military organization, to a structure that deals with defence issues, not relying, as before, exclusively on NATO and the United States.
335	9	Ukraine as the launch ramp of the EU’s war policy. The country receives 500 million euros from the European Peace Facility (European Peace Facility). In the past, this financial structure was mainly funded by the EU’s peace-run operations in Africa. It is now working to help the Ukrainian army. This is the sixth aid line to Ukraine. In total, Kiev received a support of €3.1 billion from the European Peace Fund. Of the 500 million, about 490 for the purchase, maintenance and repair of military equipment allocated to the country by Europeans.
335	11	But, the most important decision of the EU Foreign Affairs Council is the creation of the mission EUMAM Ukraine with its operational headquarters in Brussels. “EUMAM Ukraine will operate on the territory of the EU Member States and its operating headquarters will be located within the EEA in Brussels in order to ensure comprehensive coordination at the strategic level,” the website of the European Council reports, precising: “The Vice Admiral Hervé Bléjean, Director of Military Planning and Driving Capacity (MPCC) within the EEA, will be the commander of the mission.” “The initial duration of the mandate of the mission, of non-executive nature, will be two years, and the financial reference amount for the common costs for that period will be €106,700,000.”
335	13	The mission will ensure coordination with the bilateral activities carried out by the Member States in support of Ukraine, as well as with other international partners sharing the same values, and will be open to the participation of third countries. “EUMAM Ukraine will provide individual, collective and specialized training to the Ukrainian armed forces, including their territorial defence forces, and will ensure the coordination and synchronization of the activities of the Member States aimed at facilitating the provision of training,” the European Council said.
335	15	Ukrainian soldiers will be trained to manipulate the equipment supplied to the Ukrainian army by the European States. “Today we intensify our support to Ukraine to help it defend itself against Russia’s illegal aggression. The EU military assistance mission will train the Ukrainian armed forces so that they can continue their courageous struggle. The EUMAM is not just a training mission; it is the undeniable proof that the EU will stand by Ukraine as long as it takes,” said Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. “The aim of the mission is to contribute to the strengthening of the military capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces to effectively carry out operations in order to enable Ukraine to defend its territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, to effectively exercise its sovereignty and to protect civilians,” the European Council stated.
335	17	From a “peaceful future” to a war entity. The EU is now war and not peace. Thus, the European Union, and not only the NATO or some European countries, is directly and officially involved in the military struggle of the Ukrainian armed forces. This is a very important change in the functioning of this organization which was based in its origin on a peaceful and prosperous will. The creation of the mission EUMAM Ukraine profoundly changes the face of the EU to take a military-political direction.
335	19	There is already a military alliance that unites the European States. It is impossible to separate NATO and the EU. Both organizations are mainly the same countries. In addition, the EU’s security and defence cooperation is already in place.
335	21	It is to be noted that this EU takes a new war structure that goes away from its primary values which are, according to the EU Charter, for example, the affirmation that “the peoples of Europe, by establishing each other an increasingly closer union, have decided to share a peaceful future based on common values”, that “the Union contributes to the preservation and development of these common values in respect of the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe” and “assures the free movement of people”.
335	23	"There was a tendency to solve defence issues also within the European Union. France is the traditional lobbyist for this. But the Ukrainian-Russian conflict has radically changed the European people’s attitude towards defence issues. With the rapid departure of the U.S. forces from Afghanistan, Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy had launched the slogan: ""A stronger defense Europe is in the interest of NATO."" He emphasized, “it will be each for himself and the return to the idea that security and defence competence belongs only to the States. Or we evaluate the threats together and organize ourselves to deal with them together.” Now the situation has changed, and this is reflected, among other things, in the EU’s defence policy change."

3350	1	Climate: “We’re close to several shift points”
3350	3	Greenland’s glaciary disappears, coral rivers die... Climate change points are numerous and could occur at 1.5°C of global temperature rise, scientists warn.
3350	5	The disappearance of the ice, the stop of the Gulf Stream, the disappearance of the Amazon forest... The occurrence of these events due to climate change increasingly concerns the scientific community. An international study published in Science on Friday 8 September makes the summary of scientific knowledge on these climate shift points, otherwise these drastic and irreversible earth transformations beyond certain temperature thresholds. “It becomes clear that we are already close to several shift points, some of which are little known to the public,” commented for Reporter David Armstrong McKay, a researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the first author of the study.
3350	7	In addition to listing sixteen shift points identified today by climatologists, the study precises the temperature thresholds to which these shifts become likely (see the map below). And it shows that several shift points such as the disappearance of the Greenland glacier calot or the death of the coral rivers will likely be achieved by a temperature rise of 1.5 °C. The global warming is now 1.1°C.
3350	9	Scientists have explained for several years that irreversible effects are predictable below the maximum 2 °C of warming, which is yet the target shown by the states. In its fifth report, the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (Giec) had thus revised its temperature range that could trigger shift points. Some phenomena could even occur as the global temperatures rise by 1 °C. In other words, we may have already triggered some shift points without knowing it. And because: with the inertia of phenomena, they will not be observable for a long time, or even very long.
3350	11	“This study provides solid scientific support to the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement.”
3350	13	In fact, if the coral reefs could disappear in a decade, the degel of pergelisol will be counted in hundreds of years and the fountains of the glacial calots will take several millennia. For each shift point, the study thus specifies to what time scale they will come. Knowing that the time range is often inaccurate: the disappearance of mountain glaciers could take between 50 and 1000 years.
3350	15	With this summary, the authors, however, show that, despite the strong uncertainty that weighs on the shift points, scientific knowledge progresses thanks to the advances in paleoclimatology, the accuracy of current observations and the improvements in climate models.
3350	17	Beyond the scientific elements, this is a political message that the Stockholm Resilience Centre wants to pass. “This study provides a strong scientific support for the more ambitious 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement, which would minimize the likelihood of triggering climate change points. However, several shift points are still possible or even likely at this level, making probably 1 °C a safer limit. Knowing that the current policies put us on the dangerous trajectory of 2.6 °C. »
336	1	Recalling the clandestines to the border: a macronist deputy admits that “this doesn’t work”!
336	3	Traditionally, the left and the media – pleonasm? They don’t like to have news about a real person who doesn’t end up contradicting them. However, there are exceptions, such as Jean-Carles Grelier. This macronist deputy of the Sarthe, this 20th October, came to say altogether on CNews and at Jean-Marc Morandini what so many French persist to think altogether.
336	5	It is no need to specify that, in full drama Lola, the question of the OQTF (obligation to leave the French territory) is more than ever. And here is our edile admits the sad reality: “There are 700,000 people under OQTF in France, says Jean-Carles Grelier. Where do we find the means, the time and the possibility to create 700,000 seats? And the best for the end: “I recognize that the procedures do not allow today to solve the problem. »
336	7	Jean-Marc Morandini says illico: “There are 700,000 people under OQTF today? So 700,000 people who should not be in France. We are sick in France, sorry. It is a catastrophe! In the face of this almost a million unwanted, Jean-Carles Grelier then has no other choice than to admit: “This is the reality of things today. The OQTF is a device that doesn’t work. “The confession is great. But this would not be the first time that Eliseo would send some affidates to the front, a story of calming the right branch of his electorate in order to hide the caca of the cat, as it is said in less hupped circles.
336	9	In this record, Gerald Darmanin, Nicolas Sarkozy’s “mini-me”, as in Austin Powers’ rejoicing saga, remains obviously insurmountable in the record of the Pyroman firefighter supposed to anticipate the upcoming fires. So, in Le Figaro of August 21, he said in a more than virile way: “55% of the criminals arrested in Marseille are foreigners. And this self-proclaimed child of immigration to marteler: “It would be stupid not to say that there is an important part of the crime that comes from immigrants. 48% of people arrested for crimes in Paris are foreigners. “These things said, he’s not wrong saying, ‘Naturally, the stranger is not by nature a criminal. But it is obvious that we have a foreign crime problem. »
336	11	Fortunately, he says, the “stranger” in question should no longer have the choice: “A stranger who commits a crime must be expelled very quickly, because he crashes on the ground that welcomes him. “If we summarize, this is what Gerald Darmanin would do if, by adventure, he was in power. The problem is that it is already there. With the results we know. And he also forgets other figures cited by criminologist Xavier Raufer, according to which “70% of individuals frequently interrogated by the police in the Paris region would have names with “non-European foreign consonance”.
336	13	On August 4, our multirecidivist Interior Minister added even a layer of it when, interrogated by Actu Lyon journalists, he assured that “40% of the crimes were committed by foreigners”, assuming thus a “link between immigration and crime”. Grégory Doucet, the ecologist mayor of the capital of the Gaules, denounces a “nauseabond instrumentalization.” In short, the “olfactive left,” so well described by the pétulant Elizabeth Lévy, in all its splendor.
336	15	In the meantime, we have the right to ask ourselves what this government plays: to blame Marine Le Pen for her alleged recovery from a more than worrying situation? Or simply give him the right by confirming the alarming figures that he advances? The question remains open.
336	17	For the French, the end of the month is hard. But for the government, the end of reign is not announced under the best wishes.
337	1	Macron and the demographic transition: confusion and betrayal
337	3	On September 15, the President of the Republic spoke in front of the prefects on the theme “Challenges and priorities of the new five years and the role of the prefects in the implementation of government policy.” Very good job for Sciences Po students. The statement was largely unnoticed until some journalists noted that among the challenges listed was the “demographic transition” associated, in the presidential statement, with migration flows. Was it an officialization of the “Grand Replacement”? It does not exist, but it is seen in some countries.
337	5	The presidential statement first translates a misuse of the concept of demographic transition which has a precise meaning in demographic science. This is the moment when the peoples pass from a situation of high mortality and high birth, which balances to a situation of low mortality and low birth, which also balances. But what Emmanuel Macron actually mentioned was, in addition to the question of dependence, what demographer and geographer Gerard-François Dumont called “demographic winter”, i.e. a low birth rate that no longer allows the simple renewal of generations, or even an excess of deaths compared to births. However, this situation characterizes the European continent, which in fact has slow deaths.
337	7	In the European Union, no Member State reaches the rate of renewal of generations. France approached it, but the harshness of the socialists and their allies to destroy the French family policy, one of the few national policies that was an example, to make it a simple social policy, led to an immediate drop in the birth rate. It should be noted that the conditioning of resources aimed in particular to disadvantage the middle class to reserve its benefit to the so-called popular classes. Definitely, the left has demonstrated a perverse logic to form a replacement electorate with the minorities of all kinds since it has decided to leave the world of workers and employees to their fate.
337	9	What’s curious is to see that Mr. Macron seems suddenly to discover this “demographic winter”, in fact a European crisis hidden for decades. Because talking about demography is talking about children, and talking about children is talking about parents as well. So of family, word honored by the progressists of all hair. Of the 27 EU member states, 16 have a negative natural balance, i.e. a higher number of deaths than those of births (Austria, Estonia, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Bulgaria). The remaining 11 Member States (Irland, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Sweden, France, Malta, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic) still have a positive natural balance but none reaches the threshold of generation renewal. For the European Union, the balance sheet has been negative since 2012. In short, the Old Continent becomes an old continent (Eurostat 111/2020).
337	11	Hungary, under the houlette of Katalin Novák, the family minister becoming the president of Hungary, has engaged in a vigorous, very concrete family policy, which has brought its fruits. From 1.25 in 2011, the fertility rate rose to 1.59 in 2020, which is the average rate in the European Union (Countryeconomy.com 2021). However, it is far from 2.1, which is the rate of population renewal. Conscious of the importance of the demographic issue, the Hungarian government organizes a global summit on demography every two years where, as a rule, the countries of Western Europe do not shine their absence, as if the issue did not concern them! Demography is the master of history.
337	13	It is true that the European Union has found the solution: immigration. And it is not unusual to hear in Brussels that the demographic crisis does not exist because there is a “human material” in abundance in the world. The vision is shared by Emmanuel Macron, which makes a link between what he erroneously calls the “demographic transition” and the migration flows.
337	15	The problem is that human beings are not interchangeable, just like peoples. They are not pions, as the peoples are not just indifferent aggregates. They have stories, cultures, languages, customs and customs that differ and make the world rich. In fact, denying or underestimating it is inhuman. To repair our demography, and it’s a long-term matter, we could imagine brave family policies, to value family and life rather than to develop a culture of death that tends to make exceptions to respect for the right to human life. Fight also against the political, social, historical and cultural death which is the deconstruction of nations. People who doubt themselves end up doubting their right to exist. They are mature to be replaced. But would the role of the President of the Republic not be to ensure the durability of the nation? Is it not a betrayal?
338	1	Why does anti-white racism cause indifference?
338	3	Ten years ago, the idea that anti-white racism could exist was intolerable.
338	5	SOS Racism, very theoretically supposed to fight racism, despite its call that would make it thought it would want to save it, considered this idea a devil invention of the extreme right. When I made in 2011 my Reflections on the White Question that proposed to dissolve the pathological hatred of the West, some of my friends feared my social death. Today, when the cruel reality is more often overwhelming than ever before the allegedly anti-racist ideology, it is more than ever possible to mention this phenomenon, which remains unelected in the salons that live on the left edge or in some editorial rooms.
338	7	But since 2020 and the George Floyd case, this racism that dislikes this anti-racism that secrets it in secret has taken a bad turn that surprises me myself. This article will provide some recent examples as well as incandescent. On Tuesday, October 4, France Culture dedicated a show to “deconstructed men”. To make the economy of an intellectual speculation, I reproduce below in extenso and without other comments, the quote that our public service radio station chose to post on Twitter to illustrate the position of 54-year-old Sebastian, who tries to “deconstrue his sexist reflections”: “I am a man, I am heterosexual, I am white, I am bourgeois, so I represent the class in which all the oppression mechanics are found.”
338	9	The lawyer who signs this chronicle claims that such essentialist generalization is, in theory, passible for the courts. In practice, the practitioner could not claim that, when it comes to heterosexual white men, a condemnation – on the contrary of other categories – would be obtained. It can only conclude that there is racism under racism. Without a doubt, what makes the specificity of anti-white racism is that it is often the emanation of self-preciation for historical reasons that have become cultural, political and now psychic. Not to write psychiatrics.
338	11	Second example: Boris Venon, the socialist deputy mayor of Mureaux, announced his resignation and his decision to leave the city due to the threats, homophobia and racism he has suffered for years. Let us listen to him, “The white, leave my city! We are at home here... That’s what I heard of myself before I was persecuted to my home to threaten me to death. Yes, citizens of European origin can be subject to racism.” The idle who exiles believes to have to add, “And it’s a man whose entire political path goes on to the left who tells you.”
338	13	As if it was necessary for the victim to clarify it to be apologized. As if this constatation was also acceptable when he came out of the Camp of the Good while he was guilty, coming from those who did it before him but who received only lazzi. The third example. Per the most troubling thing: Rudy’s calvary. This little disabled is constantly harassed and brutalized by a horde of foolish learners disbanded inside and outside his Creil high school. But let’s dare to say the things yesterday unacceptable, since this is the subject of this chronicle that would want to be liberating.
338	15	Rudy is not just a little disabled. He is also a little white. The majority of those who are martyrs are not. Speculations without great risk after George Floyd's horrible death induces for the whole world that racism niched under its skin color: my imagination is unable to describe the media and political reactions if, by hardy hypothesis, black-colored Rudy had been. The figure of Rudy’s tormenters, whose torments have been abundantly transmitted on the angry sphere, clearly explains the discretion of our great consciences. But Rudy's color is his second hidden disability when his aggressors are neighborhoods.
338	17	Beyond this affirmation, there are more hardly controversial figures about the now massive perception by the French of their sad situation. According to an exclusive survey by the CSA Institute for CNews published on October 5, 80% of the French respondents think there is anti-white racism in France in some communities. So what to do if not to name the evil and denounce it without fard or deviation? A great foreign author has shared this opinion. Douglas Murray, in a documented and intriguing book, describes this anger against the white evil that took over the Anglo-Saxon countries in Abattre l’Occident (Editions L’Artiller, 2022). As the author of these lines, Murray is convinced that the sick West has become a psychiatric hospital. Between Camus and Ionesco, between La Peste and Rhinoceros, all are hit. From universities to museums through the Anglican Church and the Botanical Gardens. All the great white men are decreed racist, from Socrates to Shakespeare. Not to forget Churchill. It is enough to have a father or uncle that may be criticized to be criticized and listed on the list of white racism.
338	19	Or even an imaginary parent. Among the countless examples, I indeed keep this mad anecdote in support of my thesis. I quote Murray about the British Library converted to the foolish anti-slavery trace: “The blacklist has become more and more ridiculous. Among the people who guarded it was – to the surprise of many – the former winner poet Ted Hugues born in 1930... The British Library added it to the cohorte of the salads because the investigators who were employed at the expense of the taxpayer claimed that they had denied one of Hugues’ ancestors, Nicolas Ferrar, who would have been “breadly involved” in the London Company of Virginia and thus in the colonies in North America. Of course, this didn’t mean Hugues had any connection with Ferrar since Nicholas Ferrar was born in 1592, and even the British Library research team couldn’t find a way to poison Hugues by establishing a direct connection. However, they recalled that Hugues was one of those who corresponded to the criteria set to make their blacklist as that person was “connected to slavery” or to someone who “has taken advantage of it”. However, “some true researchers, not employed by the British Gallery, produced the basic research work. They emphasized that beyond the absurdity of trying to condemn Hugues by association with a man who had lived from Shakespeare’s time, the statement of the British Library raised another problem, Ferrar was dead without children so well that Hugues could not be his direct descendant. »
338	21	The British Library, Murray reveals, was therefore forced to apologize plainly for contaminating one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century by linking him with someone with whom he had no relative and who, in addition, had published anti-slavery pamphlets! Murray takes two lessons from this crazy story that I am pleased to do my own: “People who claim to know what they’re talking about often don’t have any idea of it...The other lesson to get is that a small strong reaction is enough to trigger retirement. “I will say the same otherwise. In the psychiatric hospital in which crazy antiracism now makes us live, against the black lists drawn by demons, we resolutely wear a white shirt.
339	1	Transgender children and adolescents: a manna for laboratories and clinics
339	3	“Transgender wrath”, “transgender phenomenon”, “transgender wave”... Not a week passes without the word “transgender” arising up in the news. Behind the growing visibility of transidentity to one of many media is hidden a juteous business for the industries of the medical and pharmaceutical world.
339	5	Patients live
339	7	“Children and adolescents who have a healthy body are transformed into lifelong patients. Aude Mirkovic, the legal director of the Childhood Lawyers, is concerned about the future of children engaged in a transitional path. Affirming their desire to change gender, young people find themselves caught in a long and sometimes painful medical follow-up. After a meeting (not mandatory) with a psychiatrist, an endocrinologist can choose to administer puberty blockers to the child, only 10-11 years old. bone fragility, sterility, emotional disorders... these hormone inhibitors are not without consequences on the development and health of the child and can prove irreversible. Later, from the age of 16, the teenager will have to start following hormonal replacement treatment to begin the transition. Finally, in most cases, several repair surgery operations will be needed to permanently transform the body. Vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, mastectomy... “There will be repeated operations because the result will never be fully satisfying,” says Aude Mirkovic.
339	9	A flourishing market
339	11	The whole of this medical course is largely beneficial to labs and specialized institutions on the issue of gender change. In the collective book Gender Questions in Children and Adolescents (in Artège Editions), the authors explain: “For pharmaceutical laboratories, children who are oriented towards a medical transition path is a manna. They will consume lifelong hormones, molecules whose cost is high, generating significant benefits for these laboratories. “Laboratories are not the only ones to benefit from this juicy market. The market of sex change surgery is experiencing a strong expansion. According to a recent report by Grand View Research, this market would represent $2.1 billion in the U.S. by 2022. Analysts expect an increase of more than 11% by 2030. Another study, published this time by Market Watch, highlights the elements necessary to continue this growth: supporting surgery by health insurance, developing the training of specialized physicians and surgeons, adopting policies favorable to gender change surgery... So many elements have already been taken into account by many developed countries.
339	13	But the business doesn’t stop here. Once the gender change is completed, the transgender individual becomes a future client of the fertility industry. From their most gentle childhood, it will be offered to children who decide to commit to a sexual transition to take and retain their gamets so that, later, they can reproduce. Thus, at Tenon Hospital, in the heart of Paris, the Reproduction Biology Service proposes to gather the gamets of patients who want to engage in a path of gender change. Other establishments throughout France offer the same services.
339	15	Laboratories and institutes specializing in gender transition have no worries to do. The market is flourishing. In the United States, 1.4 percent of 13-17 years old are transgender. In France, according to a report submitted to the Minister of Health in January last year, 9,000 people – of which a very majority of 18-35 years – were admitted to long-term illness (ALD) for transidentity with the health insurance. The promoters of the transgender market, driven by a strong and powerful lobbying on social networks and in culture, are now seeking to push to the transition from the youngest age, to further expand their life of potential customers. Business is business.
