371	1	The “green” load falls over the weakest
371	3	"Rural Comarcas, which combine agropecuaria production with the tourist attraction of its serras and parishes, its fauna and its flora, and to which it is threatened to embark on the future on the basis of a ""electric monocultive"", scarce, even, in jobs"
371	5	On Teruel and other comarcas of Lower Aragon, archetipes of the most empty Spain, the threat of a landscape buried under the shadows of giant aerogenerators and enormous photovoltaic plaque parks, whose fruit, the “green” energy, has distant consumers, in the industrialized and well-populated areas of Valencia and Catalonia, also, of the Aragon itself, called to continue prospering, while the energy load falls over its weakest neighbors.
371	7	Thus, what the Aragonese president, Javier Lambán, considers a great success – taken by the hand of a company “friend”, Florestalia, to which his government has favoured with ad hoc autonomous decrees since 2016–, the Turolans suffer it as a direct assault to his way of life, strongly incardinated in one of the most beautiful landscapes in Spain, and seed of future population shifts.
371	9	And it will not be because the province does not contribute to the unstable process of replacing conventional energies by renewables. As today publishes LA RAZÓN, in Teruel there are currently installed 22 wind parks, in front of the 12 of Catalonia, and are in processing a total of 336 wind and photovoltaic parks, with a total power of 19,000 megawatts, i.e., twenty times more than the consumption of the entire province. With a problem added, the authorization of a very high-tension line is ongoing, projected by Florestalia to serve the Valencian community, which, if approved, would serve as a magnet for the installation of more eolian and solar macroparks.
371	11	Of course, it is not about rejecting the development of renewable energies, more in a country like Spain that lacks solid fuels, but to recognize that green energy also has environmental impacts, not only landscaping, which must be taken into account by the responsible of Spanish energy design. Because, otherwise, the burden will end up regaining, as it already happens, on the most displaced comarcas, with municipalities in chronic deficit and without the capacity of political pressure, precisely, because the number of their voters makes them prescindible in the electoral offer.
371	13	"Rural counties, which combine agropecuary production with the tourist attraction of its serras and parishes, its fauna and its flora, and to which it is threatened to embark the future on the basis of a ""electric monocultive"", scarce, even, in jobs. As the neighbors of Teruel demand, it corresponds to the central government the elaboration of a plan of the territory ordering for the purposes of energy production, which guarantees the greatest environmental conservation and quality of life in the rural world. Or, expressed otherwise, the solidarity due among all the Spanish, live in peoples or in the big cities."
3710	1	Poland'sells its border' and lifts a barrier with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad
3710	3	"Poland ""sells its border"" and lifts a barrier with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad"
3710	5	Since September 19, Poland does not grant entrance permits to Russian citizens, with the exception of humanitarian cases, political dissidents, diplomats or travellers in transit.
3710	7	"Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak on Wednesday announced the ""immediate"" construction of a provisional barrier along the border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and the beginning of the work to raise a permanent wall."
3710	9	"Blaszczak explained on Wednesday in a press conference in Warsaw that the barrier that will begin to be built today will consist of a triple row of ""like those used by the armies around the world"" and that will extend along the 210 kilometers of the land border perimeter of the Russian province of Kaliningrad."
3710	11	"According to the minister, the decision to ""sell the border"" between Poland and Russia as soon as possible was taken during the ministerial council last Friday."
3710	13	"In addition, Blaszczak said that today the Polish Army's snorkeling body will begin its telemetry work for the construction of a permanent border wall on that border ""of the same type as that already exists on the border between Poland and Belarus"", which is about 2.5 meters high and 3 meters wide and is equipped with electronic surveillance measures. The wall is expected to be completed by the end of 2023."
3710	15	Recently, Polish authorities expressed their fear that Moscow could trigger a migratory crisis against Poland from Kaliningrad similar to which it lived until a few months ago with Belarus as the protagonist.
3710	17	Since the end of 2021, thousands of migrants from Asia and Africa have concentrated on the Polish-Belarusian border with the intention of illegally entering the European Union (EU), which has caused a strong diplomatic tension between Minsk and Warsaw.
3710	19	Poland accuses Aleksander Lukashenko’s regime of attracting thousands of people from countries such as Iraq or Syria and of inciting them to cross Polish territory to destabilize and provoke Poland.
3710	21	"Krzysztof Sobolewski, a spokesman for the Polish government party, said a few days ago that ""Moscow could plan a similar operation"" from Kaliningrad and said that the city's airport has begun to receive from recently flights from the Middle East and Asia."
3710	23	Since September 19, Poland does not grant entrance permits to Russian citizens, with the exception of humanitarian cases, political dissidents, diplomats or travellers in transit.
3710	25	Moreover, since last week, Russian citizens are denied to obtain work permits in Poland and those currently holding it will not be able to renew them.
3710	27	"Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak on Wednesday announced the ""immediate"" construction of a provisional barrier along the border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and the beginning of the work to raise a permanent wall."
3711	1	Lukashenko raises the bet on his 'chantage' to the EU with a new wave of migrants
3711	3	The migration crisis on the border between Belarus and the European Union causes new tensions. Poland and other countries call for European funding to build valleys or walls
3711	5	They travel by aircraft from Istanbul or Lebanon. They arrive in Minsk and, from there, they are taken to the border of the European Union, in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. This is what the heads of state and government of the Twenty-six have already qualified as a “hybrid attack” by the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, in response to the sanctions that the Union imposed on Belarus for the repression of the democratic opposition after the electoral fraud orchestrated by the regime in August 2020. The objective, the EU bloc points out, is to destabilize the European Union.
3711	7	The crisis has been a marea that has gone up over the past few weeks. Migrants began to reach the EU borders in summer, especially Poland. But in recent weeks, the number of illegal entrances in the European territory has dramatically increased. Many migrants spend days in the forests that separate Belarus from Poland waiting for their time to be able to follow their journey toward their true goal: Germany.
3711	9	“What we are seeing on the border is an attempt by Lukashenko to destabilize the European Union and its member states,” a spokesman for the European Commission said. Another spokesman recalled that, in any case, migrants should be treated in a “human and worthy way based on European values.” The objective of Minsk is that the European Union lifts the foot of the accelerator in the sanctions imposed on the regime and that worsen the country’s economic situation. In front of this intention, the European Commission reminds that the government of Lukashenko keeps the repression against the Belarusians themselves and any kind of opposition.
3711	11	Lithuania and Latvia, which are also suffering this migration pressure, have closed lines with Poland and show their support for Warsaw. Artis Pabriks, Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister, said on Monday that “there is an ongoing escalation of the Belarusian hybrid attack on the Polish border.” “We demand that the EU and the EU nations support Poland in these difficult hours,” he said via social networks.
3711	13	The images of hundreds of migrants arriving at the border with Poland on Monday have scattered concerns in Brussels. The migration crisis of 2015 and 2016, during which millions of migrants and refugees entered the European territory and especially Germany, left deep scars in the European Union, caused a genuine ‘shock’ in many Member States — even those who were not affected by it — and has become the rotating axis of the national political debate in many capitals.
3711	15	The whole neighborhood of the European Union knows well that migration is the talon of Aquiles of the community club. Belarus only does what Turkey has already done at the beginning of 2020 when it threatened the EU with a new migration crisis with the aim of launching cessations from the EU club. The fact that the Twenty-seven do not have a common asylum policy especially complicates the management of migration flows and exposes the Union even more to the use that third countries such as Turkey or Belarus make of migrants and asylum seekers.
3711	17	Frontex as a solution?
3711	19	“The best way to manage joint borders is with joint resources, and Frontex and Europol are ready to attend,” the EU Executive spokesman said, recalling that the Lithuanian and Latvian authorities are already attending, but not the Poles because the government has not requested it. “Poland has to ask for that presence and we have encouraged them to do so repeatedly,” the spokesman said.
3711	21	The Polish government is asking that the construction of physical barriers on the border may be funded with European funds. Warsaw has approved the construction of a wall worth 350 million euros. But the Polish government is not for anything alone in this petition. Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia joined Warsaw at the beginning of October in a letter sent to Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President of the European Commission, demanding that “this legitimate measure [the construction of a veil or wall] should be funded additional and adequately with the EU budget as a priority issue.” Some voices within the Brussels bubble, such as Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People's Party (PPE) in the Eurocam, have joined this petition.
3711	23	This group of countries brought the proposal to the last meeting of heads of state and government. But soon it is still receiving a noise from the European Commission and other capitals. “I made it very clear that there is a well-established opinion in the European Commission and in the European Parliament that there will be no [European] funding for spine and walls,” said Ursula von der Leyen, Chairman of the Community Executive, after the meeting. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, was also very contundent: “I would be ashamed to see a valley with a letter ‘Financed by the EU’.
3711	25	They travel by aircraft from Istanbul or Lebanon. They arrive in Minsk and, from there, they are taken to the border of the European Union, in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. This is what the heads of state and government of the Twenty-six have already qualified as a “hybrid attack” by the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, in response to the sanctions that the Union imposed on Belarus for the repression of the democratic opposition after the electoral fraud orchestrated by the regime in August 2020. The objective, the EU bloc points out, is to destabilize the European Union.
3712	1	Moscow deployes troops in Belarus after increased tensions on Ukrainian border
3712	3	The decision was taken, according to the Minsk version, in the face of NATO’s increased potential along its borders, especially by the rearmament of Poland and the Baltic countries.
3712	5	The Ministry of Defense of Belarus announced today the arrival of the first Russian military group that will form a military group alongside the forces of Belarus in the face of the increased tensions with neighboring Ukraine. “The first trains with the Russian military that will integrate the Regional Military Group arrived in the Republic of Belarus,” the Belarusian command said on its Telegram channel.
3712	7	“The military was welcomed with joy, bread and salt,” according to the traditions of Russian and Belarusian hospitality, the Defense Ministry said in a message, in which it published a video of the arrival. Víctor Tumar, representative of the State Mayor of the Belarusian Army, announced the next arrival of the Russian military, a decision taken by both countries in the face of the increased NATO potential on the border with Belarus, the rearmament of Poland and the Baltic countries.
3712	9	“The regional military grouping of the State Union is a strictly defensive project,” Tumar said. Last week, Lukashenko announced that he agreed to establish the group with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
3712	11	"""In view of the worsening of the situation on the western borders of the State Union, we agreed to deploy a regional (military) group"" of both countries, he said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg asked Minsk to stop supporting Russia’s “special military operation”. Ukraine accuses Belarus of complicity in the current Russian military campaign by giving its territory to the invading army to launch attacks in the neighboring country."
3712	13	The Ministry of Defense of Belarus announced today the arrival of the first Russian military group that will form a military group alongside the forces of Belarus in the face of the increased tensions with neighboring Ukraine. “The first trains with the Russian military that will integrate the Regional Military Group arrived in the Republic of Belarus,” the Belarusian command said on its Telegram channel.
3713	1	Russia calls 120,000 young people to military service promising they will not be destined to war in Ukraine
3713	3	"Russia began the autumn settlement phase for mandatory military service on Tuesday and said recruits will not be sent to the area of the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine."
3713	5	In total, 120,000 Russian citizens are called, 7,500 less than in the same period last year, and the process of their incorporation into the Armed Forces will be extended until next December 31.
3713	7	“The military that fulfils the mandatory military service fulfils tasks according to the type of unit to which they are assigned, but will not be sent to the area of the special military operation,” Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a meeting with the high Russian command. At the same time, he recalled that those who have already completed their year of mandatory military service will return to their homes this autumn.
3713	9	The Russian military command has assured that the recruits will not be sent to the territory of the popular republics of Donetsk and Lugansk and the regions of Zaporiyia and Jerson, recently annexed by Moscow.
3713	11	However, the U.S. Institute of War Studies (ISW) has warned that the recruits will “ almost safely be deployed to Ukraine around March or April 2023”, once they conclude their instruction period. According to the ISW, the sending of the recruits could occur even earlier, depending on the situation in the battlefield.
3713	13	The autumn call in Russia usually starts on 1 October, but this year it was postponed a month due to the partial mobilization decreed on 21 September by Russian President Vladimir Putin, to face the military reverses in Ukraine.
3713	15	On Friday, Shoigú gave for fulfillment the order of the head of the state and announced that the plan to mobilize 300,000 reservists was fulfilled, of which 87,000, according to the statement, was already sent to the area of the military campaign in Ukraine.
3713	17	The call to rows for mandatory military service is carried out throughout the Russian Federation, except in 25 municipalities of five federated entities located in the extreme east of the country due to its geographical location and climate conditions.
3713	19	“Most recruits will be sent to instructive units, where within a period of up to five months they will learn how to use modern weapons and train in military specialties,” said counter-almirant Vladimir Tsimlianski, from the Department of Mobilization of the General Mayor. According to Tsimlianski, the more than 25,000 accommodation committees have all the elements to equip the recruits.
3713	21	During the partial mobilization for the campaign in Ukraine, the complaints of reservists over the lack of the most elementary equipment and that they were forced to buy it with their own money were multiplied.
3713	23	The Russian law stipulates that all Russian citizens aged between 18 and 27 are obliged to perform military service, which has a duration of one year. The evasion of the mandatory military service is punished in Russia with up to 2 years in prison.
3713	25	Between 1 May and 20 September of this year, 410 criminal proceedings against evacuates of the mandatory military service were initiated, according to the informative portal RBC, which highlighted that it is the largest number of cases in the last ten years in the same period.
3714	1	Trans violence, leftist violence
3714	3	The totalitaries are comfortably installed here, in the West, among us.
3714	5	When an idea or an ideology has to be imposed by means of violence – whatever it is – that gives us two fundamental clues about them: that they are wrong and that they are very bad.
3714	7	This has been in history and especially in the history of the last two centuries, when the promise of the paradise ceased to be religious, it became ‘scientific’ and, with that new legitimacy, it was allowed to be much more brutal than religion had been in its worst moments, already practically forgotten.
3714	9	It is true that modernity has almost completely liberated us from that brutality – at least in the West, that phrase cannot be written in Xi’s China, Putin’s Russia or the Iran of the Ayatolls – but instead the totalitarian temptation continues to enjoy a very regrettable good health and not only in the disregardable regimes of the second and third world, not: the totalitaries are comfortably installed here, in the West, among us.
3714	11	Of course, all that violence – according to, not all, I’m going to accept that only 99% – comes from the left, but it’s to be understood: it’s their habit more or less since someone thought it’s a sad thing to waste the guillotines leaving them just as an artillery to cut pure. A story that doesn’t shame them at all: remember that that “our cuts will be with guillotine”; they’re so: they can’t avoid it nor really want it.
3714	13	It is more, if in something they are virtuous is about finding new reasons for pressure, cancellation, threat, for violence in sum. The last of the long list is the trans, by calling it somehow, the imposition to blood and fire of an ideology so radical that it does not even admit the discussion, that it does not tolerate the intellectual confrontation.
3714	15	I will not go into the irreversible damage they are doing to hundreds or thousands of confused teenagers who have no problem in ruining their lives, because they have not come here to worry about the lives of no one; I will not comment on what can suppose for so many women the practical deletion of their reality, their difference and in many areas their rights.
3714	17	"No, let us focus only on what we could call side damage, on what they are doing already to impose what otherwise could not be admitted: the cancellation to those who dare to explain the reality, the pressures to the professionals, the threats in which, again, they are proud of the most violent and disregardable past of the left: ""You have a gift under the car,"" they say to professors of the Complutense University, here, in Madrid, not in a poor and violent society, at least for now."
3714	19	Even in the Inquisition they claimed the or the or the very discerebrated, not that they don’t have the least pudor: that they look their totalitarism with an incredible breakthrough.
3714	21	I know that what is good today is deeplyconcerneate for the advance of the extreme right, insulting Vox and being all as very compounded because Meloni has won the elections in Italy, but neither the almost inexistent extreme right, neither Meloni nor of course Vox are the responsible for the pending by which we are sliding and that leads us to a very ugly site and in which, above, we have already been. It’s time to really worry.
3715	1	Abortion: More Socialist Propaganda
3715	3	The absolute lack of Pedagogy of the PP not only makes it difficult for the transmission of much more valid values than those of the left, but it makes it easier for people to identify the right with the caricature perpetrated by their ideological adversaries.
3715	5	Despite the fact that, according to the CIS, only 29% of socialist voters accept abortion without any legal reservation and despite some surveys estimating 500,000 the potential loss of voters, the Socialist Youth (JSE) has spread another of those videos so manicure to which we are already accustomed.
3715	7	"In it, you can see a teenager back that thanks the family and social support to his decision to abortion while, as a background, a series of images appear that, in theory, come to transmit all the opposite to the good desires that the girl is expressing: Rajoy, Aznar, Rouco Varela and various anonymous protesters happen as representatives of what, for the JSE, would come to be the ""right"" ranch. These dogs of progressism have it clear: they are with women and their “right to decide”; the ultramontane right, instead, postulates the need to criminalize and imprison abortionists."
3715	9	It is interesting to observe how this progressive radicalization of these left-wing young people who, given the almost functional structure of our political parties, will undoubtedly be “the leaders of tomorrow” (here is the paradigmatic case of Leire Pajín) does not worry anyone within the PSOE nor its related media. Per it is because they have conceived from the beginning the need for their youth to be a crowd of propagandists and fanatics – two qualities that these rapaces will refinate with time to become ministers and presidents of the Government – or, more likely, because socialists are convinced that they can approach the majority of the population to their radical positions and, therefore, to win their vote by persuasion, not by assimilation.
3715	11	Attitude that undoubtedly contrasts with the arriolian strategy of calming and low profile that in this and in many other topics has chosen the PP of Mariano Rajoy. An absolute lack of pedagogy that not only makes it difficult to transmit a message and a much more valid values than the left, but in this case makes it easier for people to identify the right with the caricature perpetrated by their ideological adversaries. If a party does not boldly fill out their program, if it does not clearly express what they are and what are not their ideas, it is leaving the rival to distort them conveniently. And for this it is not enough to appear to be a moderate conciliator, since the figure of the wolf with lamb's skin is sufficiently disseminated in the popular imaginary as to four beautiful words can cancel the propaganda efficiency of socialism.
3715	13	In the video, for example, it is again insisting on the inexistent right of the woman to decide, that is, to abortion, that is, to end with the life of the nasciturus. If it is not sufficiently repeated that not all right implies an extension of freedom, but that many of them are a mere screen to secure it, and that the parents are not only rights holders against the nasciturus but, especially, obligations (because they are responsible for placing it in that particular situation of dependence and indefence), the battle will be lost in advance. Because a society is much easier to digest the distribution of prebends than the assumption of duties. It’s so simple and very bad they have to have done things from the political pulpites when the left continues to triumph at the time of disseminating such false consigns as that the right wants to imprison women, without actually having been a single imprisonment of an abortionist since the approval of the Constitution.
3715	15	But there are the youths of the PSOE: defending the free bar against the rights of the nasciturus as if a sign of progress was treated. It is not, therefore, that the PP responds now with another video of the opposite sign, but that its ideas are not hidden but are transmitted with sufficient clarity as so that manipulation exercises such as those of the PSOE only find the emptiness and rejection among the population.
3716	1	91,000 signatures in just a week against abortion
3716	3	The response of the associations provided to the public consultation of Equality on the new Law shows the opposition of a part of society
3716	5	“We are David in front of Goliath, we will always look small, and we will always look few.” With these words defines María Sánchez Galindo, one of the spokesmen of the association provided “Right to live”, its struggle without a break to freeze the approval of a law – that of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy – “contra the one we are the majority of the Spanish society, although they are not here today physically”.
3716	7	The metaphor perfectly represents what happened yesterday at the doors of the Ministry of Equality. A twenty people – in representation of many more – responded with 91.0000 signatures, collected in just seven days, to the public consultation that the Minister of Equality, Irene Montero, opened to citizens to express their opinion on the new Abortion Act. It should be remembered that, the Council of Ministers recently approved the draft reform of the Organic Law 2/2010, of 3 March of reform of the Law of Sexual and Reproductive Health and of Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy, which will expand “rights” and eliminate obstacles to abortion (it is extensive to minors of 16 and 17 years, or persons with disabilities, without the need for permission of the parents or legal guardians) or, as it is officially expressed “to exercise the right to the voluntary interruption of pregnancy”, regulating also the individual and constitutional right to the objection of consciousness of the health personnel.
3716	9	“Every progressive government radicalizes the law of abortion. A law that boasts the murder of 90,000 children every year in Spain, and that now wants to also disprotect the minors and the objection of the doctors’ consciousness,” said one of the spokesman for Right to Live, Miguel Tomás.
3716	11	The volunteers of the platform made a scenification in front of the Ministry of Equality in which they represented the minister surrounded by bags of money, because they consider that “the true goal of this law is to enrich the business of the abortion centers.” “Millions of people want to say to Minister Montero ‘No’ to abortion and ‘Yes’ to life. And we would have liked to be able to talk to her and present her our posture, but it seems that she has no time to address the associations that defend life, as yes she has it to receive those that defend death,” Thomas said.
3716	13	Equality not only did not want to receive them, but has not accepted the physical delivery of the signatures, apologizing in the argument that “this Ministry has no physical registration, so all the records have to be electronic”, in the words of the building security manager. “This draws a lot of attention because, in addition, I, as a citizen, can enter a public administration. There is no public administration that can close the passage to me,” says María Sánchez Galindo.
3716	15	“Roe vs Wade”
3716	17	The unprecedented filtering of the American Rotative Political in early May on the existence of a deletion – signed in February of this year – in which an agreement is signed between Supreme Court judges, which aims to revoke the current abortion law – coming from the Roe judgment against Wade – has generated a social, media and political revolt of incalculable magnitude, within and outside the United States.
3716	19	In that historic case of 1973, the country’s highest judicial institution dictated that the Constitution protects the freedom of a pregnant woman to choose to interrupt her pregnancy without excessive government restrictions. What has been a constitutional law for more than half a century seems to be a punishable crime.
3716	21	“We’re at the right time to fight because it’s now when there’s a social debate against abortion, which didn’t happen neither in 2010 nor in 1985. Not only in Spain but in the rest of the world. “We, from the Citizen Go platform, which is the international branch of the ‘Do Hear’ platform, are also releasing a battle in Washington,” said Sánchez Galindo.
3716	23	“We’re going to be pressing to get to the Constitutional Court, we’re not going to stop.” The associations are preparing a joint demonstration for June 26th.
3717	1	My abortion
3717	3	The logic would be that man could decide and choose what they call “financial abortion,” which is nothing more than discouraging of the embryo and what it gives itself.
3717	5	"A shocking scene, one of so many, of the Monty Phyton's ""Brian's Life"", which these days is sent by whatsapp: one of the insurgents confesses he wants to be a woman. “From today I want to be Loreta, it’s my right as a man,” and they ask him, “why do you want to be a woman, Stan?” to which he answers, “because I want to have children, men also have the right to have children.” At the end they come to the conclusion that they will struggle before the Romans for the right to parry from men even though they cannot have children. This absurd sequence, which today would seem out of the real press wheel of the Council of Ministers when it speaks Irene Montero, continues to make us laugh, fortunately, although the reason for the chant now is a philosophical and progre soflama that demonstrates how ridiculous it is able to breathe the new left."
3717	7	The same goes, you apologize, with the supposed right to women’s abortion. In order to be equal before the law, abortion should not be only a right of the woman, that the subscriber does not consider it so, but also of the man, since, in case of getting to good port the pregnancy, the man must comply with the obligation to keep, at least with one part, the newborn, until he is older. If sex has been consented, yes it is yes, and both are equal of conditions, the logic would be that man could decide and opt for what they call the “financial abortion”, that it is nothing more than discouraging of the embryo and what it gives of itself, for otherwise we would not be equal before the Law, which would make men victims of the most rancy rules of the heteropatriarchate. This point, which won’t emphasize the C.C., and which, of course, does not deal with the Supreme Court of the United States or the Church, would imply a liberal request that has nothing to do with religion or decimononic moralities, so it’s not right to explain why the left doesn’t make a Monty Phyton, this time seriously.
3718	1	British court investigates alleged supply of uniforms to Islamic State
3718	3	Sources close to European intelligence services confirmed to MIL21 that the English Court has been investigated in relation to the supply of the modern uniforms used by the Islamic State in the wars in Syria and Iraq. Various intelligence services, which try to uncover the supply networks of the jihadists, placed the large Spanish warehouses at the point of view for their specialization in manufacturing military uniforms and for Qatar's entry into its administration council, the country whose jeaks finance the terrorist Islamic State.The company created by Ramón Areces in 1935 has been making tens of thousands of uniforms for the armies around the world, including the Spanish. They are contracts that bring millions of profits to El Corte Inglés, as clothes are manufactured in countries where the cost of work is very low.
3718	5	The governments of China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia, among others, with salaries of less than a dollar a day and sun-to-sol hours that use in many cases minors as workforce, do not put traps to large Western textile companies for military clothing.
3718	7	The modern pixeled camouflage uniforms used by the Islamic State have been funded by Qatari Jeques
3718	9	European intelligence services such as the German, Austrian, Dutch and Italian have long investigated the network of suppliers of the Islamic State or ISIS, an aspect to which little attention is paid because the focus is always on weapons.
3718	11	However, the avitualling – the Toyota picpuk family in which terrorists, mobile phones, radiotransmitters and uniforms are deployed – is essential for the support of the jihadist military machinery.
3718	13	Psychological weapons
3718	15	The uniforms represent a powerful psychological weapon for any regular army or armed movement: the uniforms project an image of cohesion and discipline, infund fear to the opponent, and raise the fighter's morality and self-esteem by feeling part of a respected or feared organization.
3718	17	More than 60,000 jihadists are currently fighting in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen, according to estimates from U.S. and Russian intelligence.
3718	19	With its modern military uniform, the Islamic State tries to convince the public that the Caliphate has a powerful army.
3718	21	The executives of the Daesh’s propaganda videos know the importance of uniforms to implant in the world’s public opinion the image that the self-proclaimed “Califate” has a powerful regular army.
3718	23	He called the attention of the secret services that uniforms appear in videos and photographs as if they were just released, despite being used in the battlefield, which led them to think there was an abundant supply.
3718	25	The English-Qatar connection
3718	27	That “abundance” led to investigating the large textile companies that would be behind the clothing for the Islamic State. The entry last summer of Qatar's capital to the Spanish textile company El Corte Inglés shot all the alarms, the aforementioned sources say.
3718	29	The double circumstances were given that the English Court has specialized in the manufacturing of military uniforms in China and that Qatar had entered the Spanish company’s shareholders, initially with a 10% of the capital (billion euros).
3718	31	While Saudi princes and institutions are responsible for financing the arms of the Islamic State, Qatari jeques have specialized in the chapter of the avitualling of the jihadists.
3718	33	50,000 uniforms
3718	35	The investigation by European intelligence services on companies allegedly providing uniforms to the Islamic State remains open. The jihadists would have stored more than 150,000 desert-pixeled camouflage uniforms like those that appear in the photographs that accompany this information.
3718	37	The published article is dated December 2015. Your sources close to European intelligence services are due to TBO, for not to know in 8 months who manufactured and marketed the uniforms mentioned. With the desire to hurt El Corte Inglés that I see there is already you would have published the result of such hard research. I smell all of this.
3718	39	Well, I don't understand that if they're so bad these of their Caliphate - that they're - we sell them or their friends anything, that it's not poison for them to eat it and all the imbeciles that trade with them, and if the English Court does it, I want to know it to never buy it anything. The stupid jealousy.
3718	41	I find that everything I have read is very difficult to understand by the chaotic, and that politics and religion have me harsh.I only want the whole earth to have peace, and that we continue to evolve after a better life among the peoples because only freedom will make us see the light of reason.
3718	43	Not coincide the numbers... abundance of military clothes... 300,000 jihadists fighting... 150,000 clothes. Something is wrong, or they don’t enjoy the abundance they say in the article (because it touches a uniform for each two :s) or the numerical data are wrong. Could it be alarming?
3718	45	I don’t know.
3718	47	I condemn the DAESH or ISIS as the one more, but I attracted the attention that. ...

3718	51	We only have to try to change the direction and our best weapon is the protection of human rights.

3718	57	The foundation of the issue is... money.
3718	59	Why so scandalous? The Holy Mother Roman Catholic Church is involved (as an actionist) in known weapons company, and no one puts the cry in heaven.
3718	61	Well, yes; “God” cursed the English Court for his alleged sale of uniforms to Daesh, something that seems formidable to me (call it for such action), but no one opens the mouth for the construction of 5 fragatas for Saudi Arabia that, let’s not forget is who more supports the terrorist group because, who assures me that at a given time these characters that even our King laughs them thanks, don’t “leave the fragatas to those fans?
3718	63	It is unbelievable, but it is necessary to make laws that if they are vulnerable, they are responsible as it is not said that European companies can and cannot do.
3718	65	The English Court is a multinational that has known wue is doing
3718	67	It’s a solemn bubble, perfectly it could have sold any other company.
3718	69	The problem is knowing who organized, funded and armed the Islamic State, not who sells uniforms, and that we will know within a few years.
3718	71	I don’t think there is a Western state that has not done business with them.
3718	73	What we can expect from a company like El Corte Inglés whose current general director, Dimas Gimeno, nephew of the deceased Isidoro Álvarez, formed part of the candidatures of Falange Spanish Independent in the general elections of 1996.
3718	75	The terrorist group was formed by the United Kingdom, the United States and Saudi Arabia. What they need to investigate is that countries that are the ones that will have made the order of uniforms. Or do you think that these terrorists have been formed by some furriel cable?
3718	77	To see if one day all this underlying and immoral economic system ends, which is reduced to the numerical balance of profits and losses. Let each of us do everything that is in hand to not benefit it. Happy Christmas!!The!
3719	1	The Lies and the Climate Change Staff
3719	3	The so-called climate change, previously known as global warming, seems to be a great business for numerous institutions, although it is true that we approach an important climate change, in no case it is due to the human hand or the so-called greenhouse effect produced by CO2.
3719	5	There are significant interests, taxes, taxes and sanctions for those countries, industries and even you if you have a vehicle or company that exceeds the permitted CO2 production limits, behind all this maremagnum of scattered data, sensationalist news from the big media and unreliable climate models, hidden enormous amounts of money that jealously distributed institutions such as the UN IPCC among others.
3719	7	About this, we talk in the program of Lights and Shadows, we hope that you like it and serves as another point of reference alien to the so-called unique thought.
372	1	The PP disappears and is now at 36 seats of the absolute majority.
372	3	He won the left for the first time and the coalition’s parties explode: they lose 1,639,154 votes and 40 members.
372	5	The change of trend in the distribution of supports between the two blocs that have marked Spanish politics in recent years continues to consolidate after the historic majority that popular Juan Manuel Moreno achieved in Andalusia in the last autonomous elections.
372	7	According to the latest survey by NC Report, the first carried out nationally after these Andalusian elections, the PP disappears up to the 138-140 seats, remaining in its highest hole at only 36 seats of the absolute majority. This was an unthinkable scenario for both the PSOE and the PP at the beginning of this year, when the elections in Castilla and León had not yet been held. The Pact in this autonomous community of the PP with Vox has not had any collateral effect for the popular, as they predict from the Government, and yes for the party of Santiago Abascal, which has entered also in a phase of slurry.
372	9	If general elections were held today, the PP of Feijóo would obtain 32.2 percent of the votes, and would recover up to 2.741.603 votes with respect to the previous general. With a lot of difference, it is the party that grows most, and on account, in addition, of winning supports at the expense of Citizens, mainly, but also of Vox and the PSOE. In parliament, its growth would be between 49 and 51 parliamentarians. Mariano Rajoy, in his last election as a candidate, won and ruled with 137 members: his party would already overcome that barrier today.
372	11	The popular growth goes linked to the practical extinction of Citizens, which only retains an acta of the ten that it achieved in the general elections of November 2019.
372	13	Change in Vox
372	15	But the most striking thing in this first survey after the Andalusian autonomous areas is the trend change in Vox. His resistance, which seemed to be a bomb test, gives his first symptoms of weakness because he begins to suffer losses in his electoral camp, up to 173,859 votes, and between seven and nine Deputies.
372	17	The two parties would overcome the absolute majority, but if the electoral radiography announced by this survey was confirmed the most likely is that Alberto Núñez Feijóo would force a government in solitary, as the PP has done in Madrid and in Andalusia. At least with that goal he would sit at the table of negotiation in the absence of seeing the position that the formation of Santiago Abascal had fixed.
372	19	On the left, the decalabro leaves them without an alternative majority. Neither by adding all the nationalist, independentist and other minorities, Pedro Sánchez would be able to form a government.
372	21	This is due to the fact that the PSOE continues to leave supports on the way, which in numbers involve up to 866.058 votes and between 25 and 27 members. In fact, today it would be in the hole of the 93-95 members. But the votes that lose the socialists don’t go to the brand of Unidas Podemos, not even under the expectation of that new platform “Suma” which has already been presented by the Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Labour, Yolanda Díaz. The residents leave another 773,096 votes and between 10 and 12 members. A breakdown in all the rules of the coalition's experiment.
372	23	The data that they handle in Ferraz are not more optimistic, on the contrary, they confirm this state of “free fall” in which they lose votes on all sides, therefore the strategic urgency of finding formulas to mobilize the left voter. By the way, the survey was elaborated coinciding with the debate of the State of the Nation and when the popular announcement of Sánchez was already known to impose new taxes on banking and energy. However, the estimates do not yet detect any effect in favour of the PSOE thanks to these announcements.
372	25	In those days also was known the resignation of Adriana Lastra as the party's vice secretary and was on the street the expectations of changes in Ferraz's organigrama to strengthen the structure after the Andalusian debacle.
372	27	Fidelity of the PP voter
372	29	In this context, the PP strengthens the fidelity of its voter, unlike what happens to the rest of the parties. The popularists retain 95.7 percent of those who trusted in it in the last generals, a percentage that in the PSOE case roots 80 percent. But it still goes to Podemos in this field, as 30 percent of its voters are escaped. The formation of Santiago Abascal, on its part, retains 83.5% of his faithful.
372	31	And of the “trips” of the survey, the most favourable data for Geneva is its ability to steal right and left votes. The PSOE captures 8.9% of the supports the socialists received in the last general elections. From Vox, a 14.8 percent. And of citizens, up to 67.5 per cent. Precisely, this fact, tested also in the internal surveys managed by the popular, is the main reason for the growing optimism in the PP about its electoral expectations.
372	33	In a complicated economic context, and with the flying goal of the autonomous and municipal in May of next year, in which they believe they will also play with advantage, they begin to propose the possibility of achieving a solid majority that approaches the absolute.
372	35	After so many years of political fragmentation, this hypothesis implies a radical change of trend, as it would be a consequence of the deflation process of the new policy, both right and left.
372	37	By ages, the People's Party appears in this survey for the first time as the most voted party in all segments, also among the youngest, where it is imposed on Vox, PSOE and Podemos (which until now was the preferred option among voters of 18 to 29 years). Their highest number of votes is among those over the age of 45.
3720	1	The patronal calls on the administrations to establish labour couples for migrants in sectors such as rural
3720	3	CEOE Vice-President, González de Lara, is favorable to rational migration processes, as long as “there are job offers for those who come to sit down”
3720	5	It is not a few times that the informatives get to reluce the labor exploitation to which certain entrepreneurs submit immigrants. too much. The socio-economic inclusion of this collective remains a subject pending in Spain. Their labor and salary stability is scarce.
3720	7	According to the study 'Un arraigo sobre el alambre' presented by Cáritas in September of the year 2020 along with the University Institute of Studies on Migrations of the Pontifical University of Comillas (IUEM), 75% occupy forced and poorly paid jobs. The migrant population arriving in our country is mostly young, with an average age of 36 years.
3720	9	As for the level of studies, migrants have a formative level very similar to those of the Spanish population, since while 29% of the nationals have higher studies, the percentage is of a 23% among Latin American foreigners, a very similar figure. Data on human capital that do not marry with their bad working conditions and with precary labour development.
3720	11	Employers call for governments to establish labor couples for immigrants
3720	13	In this sense, the Vice-President of the CEOE, Javier González de Lara, has shown favour in ECCLESIA that Spain drives processes of rational immigration “where there are job offers for those who come to sit.” A set of actions that Spain does not end.
3720	15	For the number two of the representative of the business sector, it is the public administrations to which it competes to help to establish “cups in certain activities such as the rural area, where there are increasingly fewer Spanish workers who want to work and allow certain cups of immigration to do so normally. There are provinces in Spain that do so,” González de Lara expressed in ECCLESIA.
3720	17	At the thread of this demand, CEOE’s vice president has put as an example the U.S. model that, according to his opinion, has managed to settle its labour market “thanks migratory processes that have enriched jobs and social integration”, he considers.
3721	1	VOX seeks to palliate the effects of the “nefaste energy policy” of the last decades
3721	3	The VOX parliamentary group in the Cortes of Castilla and León has registered two parliamentary initiatives today in the situation of economic emergency that Spain lives, motivated by the lack of energy sovereignty and the erratic political carried out by the different governments of the nation in the last decades in everything related to the management of this strategic sector.
3721	5	For this reason, the parliamentary group has registered a Proposal of Law of Modification of Law 7/2021, of 20 May, on Climate Change and Energy Transition, for the inclusion of the concept of energy sovereignty and the reversion of the ban on exploration, research and exploitation of the own, mineral and energy resources.
3721	7	Spain has the possibility to produce a large part of the energy needed for its needs, thus reducing the energy dependence and the negative effects that this implies. Therefore, the legal arrangement must correspond with a legislation that is favorable to the research of new energy plants, as well as their exploration and exploitation.
3721	9	Although VOX considers that the national legislative initiative corresponds to the General Cortes, we contemplate the resource of autonomous legislative initiative as a useful way to open, in parallel with the actions of the Parliamentary Group in Congress, a parliamentary debate on a proposal that is crucial for the economic and social development of Spain. Faced with the current situation, all the political force that VOX has is necessary to a progress in everything related to our energy sovereignty and reject the negligent decisions that have deindustrialized and weakened the nation. For this reason, VOX will present in all Autonomous Communities where it has representation a Proposal of Law to be submitted in the Congress of Deputies in the terms already expressed.
3721	11	On the other hand, also today, the parliamentary group has registered a Proposition No of Law in favour of the prospection and exploitation of the mining resources of Spain for its debate and approval before the Plenum. It is known the posture taken by the European Union and followed blindly by the Government of Spain that advocates for the total dismantling of the carbon sector, completely renouncing one of the energy resources with which our country has. A policy that time has proved wrong and that only obey the impositions of climate fanatism and the interests of ecologist lobbies.
3721	13	The energy emergency we are currently suffering has revealed a reality denied by many for years: that the closure of the coal and thermal power plants sector was a precipitated and wrong decision that was made without thinking about the interests of our region. The reality is demonstrating how coal can serve as a reserve element to cover crisis situations like the current.
3721	15	Therefore, the VOX parliamentary group in the Cortes of Castilla and León urges the Board of Castilla and León to urge the Government of Spain to take the following measures:
3722	1	The'silent invasion' begins to be noisy with an increase in arrivals that exceeds 700%
3722	3	Vox calls ‘invasion’ what has happened during the last months in the Canary Islands, where citizens and the State Security Forces and Corps are in a situation that they call ‘unstable’. Last weekend, it was a victim of the worst data so far, with the arrival of more than 2,000 illegal immigrants.
3722	5	The wave began during the first hours of Saturday, when the arrival of 16 ships that transported 643 illegals occurred. Hours later, two cayucks with 271 people entered the coast of Tenerife. The Iron, at the same time received a cayuco with 159 immigrants on board. During the last hours of the day, another ship was landed, which carried 23 illegals.
3722	7	The day of Saturday finally came out with more than 1,100 immigrants arriving on our coast.
3722	9	Sunday began very early for the members of the State Security Forces and Corps who, during the morning, received the notification of the arrival of 3 pateras with 600 immigrants on board the coast of Gran Canaria. After the first hours of the day, 85 illegal people landed on the beach of Santiago, in La Gomera. Later, in another expedition north of the Iron Island, Maritime Salvation had to assist a ship with 45 illegals. Later, the Civil Guard and Maritime Salvation received the worst news: 115 immigrants divided into six pateras, in groups of 30,29,25,23 and 4 were to get to the mole of Arguineguín, one of the hotest points of illegal immigration, where thousands of illegal people are stolen.
3722	11	The day ended with the arrival of 900 illegal immigrants. However, the 112 has confirmed that the morning from Sunday to Monday did not cease the activity for the Corps and Security Forces of the State, which continued to work on the rescue of pateras and cayucos. In total, around 2,500 illegal people landed in the Canary Islands in a little more than 48 hours and 7,000 in the last four weeks. Currently, health authorities are doing PCR tests to immigrants. So far, 45 have given positive in Covid-19.
3722	13	The National Police Syndicate, Jupol, published a statement by being aware of the events experienced this weekend, denouncing the situation in which the police, who works day-to-day at the reception of pateras. In him the lack of means, both human and material, was condemned, something that prevents them from working in good conditions, as is the case of the Arguineguin mould, where they are forced to double their turn.
3722	15	On the other hand, the police denounces that, while immigrants are performed PCR tests completely free of charge, the State Security Forces and Corps, who are in continuous contact with the illegal, are not provided with such tests, which puts both them and their families at risk of contagion. They say they have “destroyed, unattended and unable to react” to the mission-enforced agents.
3722	17	To the government’s already permissive policy with illegal immigration, it is necessary to add also the situation that lives one of the countries from which most immigrants rise: Morocco. And it is that, by having a special restriction in border policy, it makes it very difficult to return the illegal, something that the mafias take advantage of.
3722	19	Santiago Abascal, more than a year ago and being aware of the problem, qualified the wave of illegal immigration as a silent invasion, and stated that measures should be taken immediately, as it is a serious threat to the health, security and coexistence of the Spanish.
3722	21	In fact, Vox demanded months ago to the Executive a protocol for the receipt of pateras with the aim of identifying the positive cases and preventing outbreaks that may not be controlled.
3723	1	Why will not 5% of illegal immigrants return order be executed from 2020?
3723	3	The national deputy of the formation by Ceuta, Teresa López, denounces this situation after checking with the data provided by Interior that, since 2019, the percentage of immigrants expelled has fallen in pic and come to execute in what goes 2022 just a 2.8% of the orders of return dictated.
3723	5	The parliamentary ceutini had already asked about the orders for the expulsion of illegal immigrants in June. Then the National Executive's response was that the orders of return dictated by irregular entry were executed within their period of validity and that they were in accordance with the provisions of the regulations. However, from Moncloa they did not provide data.
3723	7	For this reason, López registered a new battery of questions to know how many return orders have been executed in the last three years, as well as in what goes from 2022. Also how many have been dictated and how many returns have been unestimated in the last three years and in the course of 2022. To this latter, the Government does not respond, but the other data it offers are revealing and so VOX regrets it.
3723	9	Of the 27,821 return orders dictated in 2019, 5,393 were executed, which is 19.37%. A percentage is already low for the VOX national deputy, but it falls down from 2020. And it is that, the Government reports that this year 37.287 orders of return were dictated, of which 1.623, which represents only 4.35%.
3723	11	In 2021 the situation continues to get worse and so it denounces López, who regrets how despite the considerable increase of the return orders, the number of those executed falls in the same proportion. According to the data of the Government of Sánchez, last year 42,614 return orders were dictated of which only 1.417 -3,32% were executed and in 2022 18,678 of these orders have been registered, but barely 539 return -2,88% - have been carried out.
3723	13	“Despite the government’s reticence to give us these data, and others still don’t offer us before my questions, the ones we have in this response are very revealing,” López says. And this, she points out, is because fleet flights from Las Palmas and Melilla, or transfers from Ceuta to the peninsula are usual, while the Ministry of the Interior, with Marlaska headed, does not execute orders of expulsion of people in illegal situation in Spain. Thus the Executive facilitates that, after the transfers, immigrants disperse, as they have ambulatory freedom as long as the expulsion is not executed. “Something intolerable,” López warns to add that VOX will continue to claim that these orders are executed in compliance with the law.
3724	1	Gamarra to Sánchez about the nationalists: “Are they ceased to be investigated once they got their votes?”
3724	3	“What you can’t deny is that, as a president of the Government, I was aware of who was investigated and why,” she said.
3724	5	He added that “one of the doubts that everyone has and has to clarify is, knowing what he knew, what kind of political relationship he established with the investigated and what agreements he reached with them.” “This is the key and this is what we ask you today,” he emphasizes.
3724	7	The popular leader highlights that, according to the published, “his Government knew weeks before its investidura that, by judicial order, it spies outstanding ERC leaders for their connection with violent revolts in Catalonia.”
3724	9	On the other hand, he reminds Sánchez that, in January 2020, “he was invested president for a narrow margin: 167 votes for against 165 against. The key was 18 abstentions from two parliamentary groups: Left and Bildu.” “It’s for them who you should be president today,” he emphasizes.
3724	11	“Have you already made enough concessions to independentism for your parliamentary support or you still have a lot to do and what are they?” he asks to answer.
3724	13	He replicated the head of the Executive that “it is an authentic disparate negotiating the investidura of a Government with whom they were being investigated for the danger they supposed for the State of Law in Spain.”
3724	15	Gamarra asserts that “there is no greater concession to the independentists than to deliver the governance of a country to those who are the threat to the constitutional order.”
3724	17	“If you knew they were a danger and they were being investigated, how is it possible that I opened the doors of the Moncloa and sat down with them to negotiate?” “This does not happen in any democracy in the world,” he said.
3724	19	“But, did they stop being investigated once you got your parliamentary votes or did you decide after meeting with them in La Moncloa?” he asks showing a picture of a meeting of the Dialogue Table in February 2020. “Contact, because this is one of the keys to your legislature,” he says.
3724	21	“Their government was born of a devil pact. You knew with whom you agreed and that it couldn’t go well. And you were able to assume a lot of debt. The big problem is that he is willing to dissolve them all. To see if it tells us today here to all the Spanish what it will deliver in its next meeting to the spy Pere Aragonés,” he concludes.
3725	1	Law of Abortion, or the photo that avoids Feijóo and that will portray his synthony with Abascal
3725	3	Last week it transcended that Alberto Núñez Feijóo met in secret with Santiago Abascal, hiding the date to avoid photographs that show the synthony between the opposition chief and the ultra-right. Even, it was told that he also met with the Minister of Labour, Yolanda Díaz. But there are scenes and moments much more powerful and revealing than a photograph. On Thursday, the Bank of the People's Group will merge with Vox's during the debate on the reform of the abortion law.
3725	5	The plenary will address straight amendments of return registered by PP and Vox to the Organic Law on Sexual and Reproductive Health and of the Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy. The article, driven by the Minister of Equality, Irene Montero, was approved last August 30 in Council of Ministers and collects, among other issues, access to abortion without paternal permission for the minors of 16 and 17 years. Three days of reflection are also suppressed and the public hospital network will always have staff available to practice pregnancy interruptions to women who require it.
3725	7	Geneva rejects the rule, but does not propose an alternative. The reason is obvious: avoid generating an internal debate that opens in channel to the party. In the PP, different sensitivities coexist with diametrally opposite opinions about abortion. There are Deputies who integrate the hardest core that bet directly for prohibiting that practice, while the most liberal wing, where by the way is Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who advocate for allowing minors to abortion even without the father's consent.
3725	9	Alberto Núñez Feijóo, in May, rejected the proposal of Irene Montero. According to their criterion, women aged 16 and 17 should need the authorization of their parents and, in case they refuse, it would be a family judge who takes the final decision after studying the case.
3725	11	Feijóo avoided the photo, but the scene that evidences his synthony with Abascal is inevitable
3725	13	Impossible for the PP
3725	15	The PP avoids at all costs the debate scuding that the Constitutional Court still has to resolve the appeal presented by its party 12 years ago on the law approved by the PSOE. The people intend to return to the deadlines and assumptions law of 1985, which did not contemplate abortion until the 14 weeks, but until the 12. The Organic Law 9/1985, the first that regulated the voluntary interruption of pregnancy, was acknowledged by Felipe González. He penalized the abortion in three cases: at any time as long as the life or physical or psychic health of the pregnant woman is seriously at risk, in the first 12 weeks in case of rape and in the first 22 weeks if the fetus is expected to be born with “grave physical or psychic taras.”
3725	17	In 2009 the Government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero approved a new abortion law. The Organic Law 2/2010 on Sexual and Reproductive Health and the Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy, which allows free abortion in the first 14 weeks, in the first 22 if there is a risk of “graves anomalies” for the fetus and at any time if fetal anomalies are detected incompatible with life. The minimum age for abortion without paternal permission is 16 years. It is only obliged to inform one of the representatives of the minor except if there is a risk of “gravely conflict” or a risk of “intra-family violence”.
3725	19	With the arrival of the People's Party to the Government, with Mariano Rajoy in front, the Executive decided to reform the law. It is then when Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón proposed through a bill to eliminate free abortion and was limited to the cases of violation within the first 12 weeks or in case of risk for the physical or psychic health of the mother. It eliminated, thus, the assumption introduced in 1985 that took into account possible fetal anomalies. The anteproject was withdrawn and abortion was only reformed in the cases of minors, whose parents would have to give their consent.
3725	21	Vox, Death and a Discovering Frame
3725	23	As long as the PP titubes, Vox doesn’t tighten his voice. The ultra-righteous formation rejects the reform of the abortion law because it understands that it “desprits the most fundamental of the rights”, the “natural right” of human life. “Fronting the culture of death, Vox defends life from conception to its natural extinction.” Whatever it is, PP and Vox will be positioned on the same side not only in this matter, but also in the veto to the lower by incapacity derived from painful menstruation. Feijóo avoided the photo, but the scene that evidences his synthony with Abascal is inevitable.
3726	1	The two political options that the war of Ukraine left us
3726	3	The two political options that the war of Ukraine left us
3726	5	Tensions in international relations continue to rise. We are in a complex geopolitical moment dominated by two different ways of seeing the world, also in the West.
3726	7	Germany is in the middle of the storm. It occupies a relevant position at this geopolitical moment and the direction it takes in the coming years will be crucial: it is a country in which the dilemmas of the time are well synthesized.
3726	9	In first instance, the closure of the Russian energy supply, which convened especially to Berlin, has led the country to a new scenario. It’s not just about having enough energy, but it’s available at an affordable price. The impossible medium-term replacement of the Russian sources by others of similar cost implies a remarkable damage to the German state, its citizens and above all to its industry, a fundamental sector in its dominant position in Europe.
3726	11	This change obliges Germany to rebuild its economic priorities. And the direction he has taken did not like in the EU. France is increasingly discontented, and the rest of the countries don’t see much less with good eyes the measures taken by Berlin: the large amounts it is investing in its economy to compensate for the rise in gas prices and to help families and, which add to those already put in circulation during and after the pandemic, constitute a large competitive advantage over its European partners.
3726	13	Visit to China
3726	15	In that reorganization scenario, Scholz’s visit to Beijing, the next staircase, has occurred. In this new Cold War, Berlin is under pressure to reduce its trade relations with China. At the same time, incentives lead to strengthening it, because China is its main trade partner, and renouncing that relationship, or weakening it, would be an additional damage to a country that will have to face complicated times.
3726	17	The Chinese market is part of the foundations on which the foundations of German economic prosperity were placed.
3726	19	Fruit of these contradictions we had industry leaders pointing as very relevant Scholz’s visit to Beijing, as Europe and the world depend on China in many aspects, also to solve problems such as climate change and food security, while Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock showed a much more hostile attitude to those relations. The official Chinese media proclaim that Germany’s disconnection with its country is not realistic, as the Chinese market is among the foundations that set the foundation of German economic prosperity. The result of the visit was exposed by Global Times, the official Chinese newspaper, in this way: “Germany and China put the emphasis on increasing mutual understanding and confidence, on adherence to economic globalization, promoting practical cooperation, opposition to block confrontation and intensification of coordination and cooperation in international affairs. Scholz again made clear his opposition to the decomposition.”
3726	21	The German version of this visit has not been so pleasant. Probably the best summary of the situation has been made by Wolfgang Münchau: “What is happening in Germany is that all the economic model, based on cheap energy and machinery exports to countries like China, has reached the limit. Germany will need to diversify in a direction that Scholz and its industrial friends are largely unknown.”
3726	23	The two ways to see the world
3726	25	So that Germany has to move on a number of pantanous lands: internally, because the disappearance of Russian energy causes problems and because its economic model is now much weaker; with its EU partners, who demand a better exit from the crisis together; and with the U.S. and China, who demand opposite things.
3726	27	Scholz's role is complicated because geopolitical demands push him in one direction and economic demands in another. Do whatever you do, you will receive criticism: it is not possible to satisfy everyone at the same time.
3726	29	However, it would be unfair to focus exclusively on Germany, because the dominant country in Europe is nothing more than the living expression of a symptom, the one of the Western contradictions.
3726	31	The U.S. is playing its cards to strengthen and to stop the emerging power
3726	33	In essence, in our political and economic systems, two logic, two ways of thinking are confronted. The first sees the U.S. hegemony in danger, observes with great concern the Chinese rise and tries to establish a powerful dicket that prevents that growth leads Beijing to lead the world. We cannot forget that the confrontation with Russia is part of this. For this kind of mentality, it is not just the military front. The open and globalized world in which we have lived would lead China to sit firmly, so, already with Trump, the U.S. initiated a protectionist turn, which Biden has implemented. There are many elements linked to energy, to the defense of the dollar and to strategic goods, but basically the U.S. is playing its cards to strengthen itself and to remove the emerging power.
3726	35	The other type of logic, more financial, desires that capital flow, that cheap and regular production continues to foster exchanges between countries and that investment opportunities and dividends increase. For this way of thinking, it is natural that a good part of globalization is preserved, that Chinese markets are opened, that hostilities are ceased, and that the open world of the past is preserved as much as possible.
3726	37	The problem is that both logic clashes: you can’t have both things at the same time. To make that happen, Beijing would have to adopt a very different perspective, and in Moscow it would have to live Putin’s defeat and his replacement by a more friendly leader with Washington. Both things would allow globalization to have a big path. Since it seems very unlikely, we will live a shock between both ways of seeing the world that will define our future.
3726	39	A disagreement without desire
3726	41	Until now, we are not living a decisive confrontation between these two positions, but it is attempted to make balances between one and the other. There is a sort of dissociation: while in the military and technological, the Cold War is already declared, with an obvious disintegration in some strategic sectors, in the economic, the steps that are being made are very enduring. It is as if a very firm rhetoric was intended to be used on one ground while on the other it was intended that things would continue to develop in the same way, but by applying small adjustments; as if deglobalization could be selective.
3726	43	Global bankers are “very pro-China,” UBS President Colm Kelleher said.
3726	45	That attempt to play with two bars at the same time becomes complicated, and especially for the West. It is seen in Germany, but also in the United States. A few days ago, Biden pointed out to the oil companies, of which he claimed that they were taking advantage of the circumstances to obtain great profits, sometimes going against interests of U.S. consumers and the same state. Biden looks little patriot to get out of the crisis and destroy it to dividends and rewards of shares, but his companies answer that, in the end, what is more American than earning all the money you can. The U.S. government insists that its country’s companies are away from China, something many deny, because it would mean losing the advantages of that cheap production that Asia provides. And the global bankers are all “very pro-China,” as UBS president Colm Kelleher said. That explains that, while in the discursive field, in the technological and in the energy, the battle with China is launched, in many other areas things have changed very little. In the end, a country’s strategic needs often confront the interests of its main economic actors. Germany is an obvious case, but it is also the US.
3726	47	At the same time, as the U.S. has decided to strengthen itself in national terms to face China, tensions with its Western partners are increasing. The Fed’s insistent rise of rates and the demands that Europe leaves China are complemented with incentives to locate companies in the U.S., also with the promise that they will have enough energy and a good price. That attitude is causing dissatisfaction in Germany and France, which warn that if Washington goes on that path, they will have to do the same. Without going further, Macron bitterly complained that the U.S. was offering Europe liquid gas at a price four times higher than that it sells in his country and Bruno Le Maire, French Minister of Economy, pointed out yesterday that “the real risk for Europe is that it remains behind technologically, industrial and economically, leaving the free field to the U.S. and China. Let us give us the means to reindustrialize Europe.”
3726	49	In other words, the contradiction between the two logic, which leads to national reinforcement and which aims to preserve as much as possible the global order so far in force, is operating first and foremost in internal terms, causing differences within the Western countries and between those same countries. It is natural, to the extent that in this new Cold War there are many things to decide yet, and the European role is one of them. It is normal that the coming years bring the priority of the strategic, in a very broad reading of the term, especially because China and Russia, as well as the US, are operating in those terms, and that changes the passage of the rest of countries.
3726	51	Germany is in the middle of the storm. It occupies a relevant position at this geopolitical moment and the direction it takes in the coming years will be crucial: it is a country in which the dilemmas of the time are well synthesized.
3727	1	Full to Zero of the Progre Left
3727	3	"Last week we submitted a survey on the so-called Pine Parental. We ask the listeners, in particular, ""Do you agree that parents are asked for authorization before giving children no moral talk in schools? “”"
3727	5	We rarely have had such an overwhelming response on a tweet. More than 95% of the 3,800 people who responded did it afirmatively. Only 4.5 percent disagree with the advice of their parents. What comes to demonstrate that this of the parent pin is one more of those topics where society goes on the one side and political parties on the other.
3727	7	That’s why the battle of public opinion is winning in this matter: when you tell people to choose between the freedom of choice and the impositions, they usually prefer the freedom of choice. How rare are these human beings, right?
3727	9	And what’s curious are the effects of this type of polemics, because what the PSOE is achieving is that those of Vox, with Santi Abascal in front, appear as the flags of freedom. So much effort to present them as dangerous fascists, to ultimately give them the image of defenders of the rights of the people in front of the impositions of the politicians! It cannot be more torpedo than this progre left.
3727	11	And not just that: Sánchez has managed to get naked to himself, making the contradictions blow out. His announcement of bringing the decision of the Murciano government to the courts makes his bet for “desjudicializing” what relates to the ‘process’ remains as what it is: a gift to those who humiliate and insulate daily Spain and the Spanish.
3727	13	"Thus, the pro-left has achieved a ""fill to zero"": it remains as a totalitarian, it places Vox as a defender of freedom and its discourse on the Catalan topic is self-destruction. Who could ask for more?"
3727	15	This leads us to the final conclusion. Contrary to what has happened in the last 15 years, we have to do all the ideological battles. All of them. Winning them is much easier than it seems. The pro-left, with its tendency to social engineering, is ordinancy by definition. Not to mention his passion for taking advantage of anything to mount a chiringuito. Both things (impositions and tendance to chiringuito) have very bad press. Let us take advantage of it.
3728	1	Calentologists Making Egypt
3728	3	This summit, in particular, exceeds in a degree of stupidity to all the previous ones, a merit that is not unthinkable because the list was very high.
3728	5	"The ""climate summit"" that the unforgettable Moratinos would say, started last Sunday in Egypt and will last for fifteen days, because in less time it is impossible to concentrate the talks, bilateral meetings and round tables of so much importance that will take place. It will be two weeks, throughout which world leaders will reign the foolish humanity while enjoying the goodnesses of the climate of Sharm el-Sheij, a well-known beach city on the shores of the Red Sea that is really precious at this time of the year."
3728	7	The UN Secretary-General says that “we are on a road to climate hell with the foot on the accelerator” so “humanity has only one option: cooperate or die.” If he believed what he said, he would have to put him a shell and lock him in a shelled room, because it would be obvious that the guy has crazy. But in reality it’s a script imposed to fulfill the role that is expected from the institution he presides, a dark international organization dedicated to large-scale corruption, the promotion of climate terror campaigns and to the massive rape of minors where he has presence on the ground.
3728	9	This summit, in particular, exceeds in a degree of stupidity to all the previous ones, a merit that is not unthinkable because the list was very high. The 150 aircraft that will carry and bring dignataries from all corners of the world will throw more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than all the Spanish agriculture in a year, which gives a measure of the degree of hypocrisy of all these characters. But if it comes to reducing CO2 from the atmosphere, there can be nothing more absurd than calling for a summit in which countries with the highest emissions of the entire planet do not participate, starting with China, which alone cuts a quarter of all greenhouse gases produced by mankind.
3728	11	But what is dealt with in these socialist aquelarres is not to study a real threat, but to feed planetary psychosis to justify the eradication of spaces of freedom and, in the meantime, to enrich the elites better connected with power. From that point of view it is very appropriate that the meeting is made in the land of the Pharaohs because, in fact, their participants are there to make Egypt: with the hand in front they threaten you and with the hand in the back they drink a coin. Almost half of what the government has previously stolen you. The other half is to make campaigns calling “derrocholics” the elderly who will go cold in winter; not for climate change, but for the decisions of all the unwilling ones that these days will enjoy the goodnesses of global warming in one of the world’s most luxurious bathrooms.
3728	13	You’ll be back, Sanchez, you’ll be back.
3729	1	My carbon footprint and I
3729	3	We don’t all leave the same carbon footprint throughout our consumer, insolidate and sinful life.
3729	5	The Government and big IBEX companies promote that each person calculate their carbon footprint, so that eco-stressed idiots determine the degree of bad consciousness that each one should assume for being contributing to global warming. Here there is no distinction between the inhabitants of the cities and rural areas, since ultimately we are all sinners and what is concerned is that we all fust for breaking the commandments of a climate cruise that already preaches until the Pope of Rome.
3729	7	But not all of us leave the same carbon footprint throughout our consumer, insolidate and sinful life. The people of the countryside, obviously, not only cause a carbon footprint of less depth than the urbanites, but, in fact, their is clearly negative. Let us make some simple numbers.
3729	9	A farmer who will spend 50 years of his life working on the countryside will have spent 125,000 hours to increase the planet’s green mass, planting and taking care of trees. In the case of plant injection, which is fundamental to create fruit or citrus trees that then fill hectares and more hectares of land, it is a fundamental activity that contrasts the carbon footprint to its negative levels. For example, during the injection season (August-September) a farmer produces 6,000 new trees, which after 40 years will have become 240,000. Let us keep this data in mind.
3729	11	The Ministry of Ecological Transition, university departments dedicated to the environment and ecologist organizations have established equivalence tables to encourage all of us to compensate for our carbon footprint. Thus, we are told that a tree compensates the emissions of CO2 of 100 cars in a day throughout its life, or that one hectare of tree is equivalent to a person’s carbon footprint for a year.
3729	13	Making some simple calculations, we have that the farmer of our example has balanced the carbon footprint of 6.575 cars for 10 years or that of 6.4 people throughout their lifetime. Multiply this product by the entire population that is dedicated to agriculture, livestock, forestry or any other activity intended to keep the rural environment alive and we will have a pretty precise image of who has to do act of contriation and suffer the consequences of the delightful regulations that impose us to delay the inevitable climate apocalypse.
3729	15	In my particular case, after spending 6 years of my youth to work in the field, I have compensated the pollution of 1.644 cars for ten years. Arrived at this point, the question is obvious How many aerogenerators of those that shake the mountains and destroy the birds can I dynamite?
373	1	Ayuso also becomes echo of the bull on the Animal Protection Act
373	3	The President of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, participated this Saturday in a few days of the People's Party under the name 'Ecology and climate change', where he has protagonized a controversial intervention where he has continued spreading the bull about the new Animal Protection Act.
373	5	His participation was based, primarily, on criticizing the President of the Government, Pedro Sánchez, of which he has assured that “ments, lies and lies”, to go to denounce the action of the left at the time of facing climate change, intervening, according to her warning, in the economy or establishing “a asphyxiant, liberticated control, on the life of the people, imposing without criterion a new way of thinking, consuming and living.”
373	7	Keeping the speech, the president has accused the coalition government of “setting the panic” and establishing the “interminable list of prohibitions they have prepared.” This means that children can adopt a hamster.
373	9	This bull appeared for the first time this week in the program of Ana Terradillos, Four to the Day, when the journalist alarmed her audience with a completely false news about the Animal Protection Act, assuring that it intended to withdraw the condition of domestic animal to the turtles, hamsters and perishes and that, in addition, “the pets of all life are about to disappear from our houses.” Source from Unidas Podemos, they had to go out publicly to deny the news and tacted the journalist as “one of the most obvious examples of waste journalism.”
3730	1	The Western Invention of Moderate Islamism
3730	3	Summer Diary: The Western Invention of Moderate Islamism
3730	5	I still don’t understand why you have to choose between pest and cholera.
3730	7	"A group of about 60 liberal-conservative intellectuals, namely Bernard Henry-Levy and a lot of U.S. academics have addressed a letter to Obama encouraging him to punish the feathers of the Syrian tyrant and proposing him, as it could not be less, a future plan for after the armed intervention that passes through the agreements of the laic and liberal in Syria with what is usually called ""moderate Islamism"", a fat ally necessary to avoid the luculous path of Libya, Egypt and other spring Arab areas, now damaged and bursted by the civil war."
3730	9	The problem of moderate Islamism is that it does not exist. There are Islamists, such as the Saudis who are allies of the USA, but whose liberal civilization fight in their country at blood and veil. There are Islamists who proclaimed themselves moderate and compatible with the democratic and laic political forces, but who as soon as they came to power from their hand, they left and pulled out the fanaticism they carry inside, bringing in Egypt the turn of the military supported by those same laicists who believed possible the pact with that they call moderate Islamism, and that it is not very well known what it is.
3730	11	I imagine that they refer to those Islamic countries under Western influence in which the corruption of political, civil and military regimes as in Morocco or Egypt, allow certain sectors of society to escape the shocking theocracy. But that’s not Islam or moderation, it’s an absolutely arbitrary tolerance and managed by corruption. Better than the mulas, of course, but very far from that moderate Islamism, which, to political-military effects, only exists, yes, outside of Islam. And that it will now serve as an intellectual coartade to help the wildly immoderate Islamists fighting against the wildism, not precisely an anti-Islamic or free-thinking, of Assad and its allies from Tehran, Moscow and Havana. I still don’t understand why you have to choose between pest and cholera.
374	1	Climate change: the lessons learned by the world
374	3	Someone has always to pay the invoice, whether it is companies, consumers, taxpayers or politically indefenced.
374	5	If it is not broken, the government will break it. This seems to be the lesson to extract from other nations that have launched energy plans against climate change similar to what Obama recently proposed in his Climate Action Plan.
374	7	and Australia. The Australian carbon dioxide tax boosts as the costs and difficulties to manage it are causing damage. Many companies that already suffered by the hard economic situation were brought to the limit by higher energy prices, in part due to mandates for renewable energies and carbon tax. Last year, Australia saw 10,632 companies break down, a record for a single year. Approximately a fifth of them belonged to the large energy consumer and construction industry. The Australian Tourism Service also expects the tourism industry to pay $155 million annually in extra costs for the increase in energy prices, specifically due to carbon tax. As a result of this and with the September elections approaching, there are doubts that the tax will survive much beyond its first anniversary.
374	9	• Germany. After the nuclear accident in Fukushima (Japan), the German government committed to replacing nuclear energy with renewables, setting the goal that 40% of the nation's electricity comes from renewables by 2020. Electricity prices have increased by 10% since the current government came to power and it is expected that the recharge in the electricity bill to subsidize the renewables will increase again. It is also increasing the number of unemployed and low-income families that are being left without electricity, as well as the wool robbery in the forests. In Germany, electricity is on the way to quickly become a luxury. Meanwhile, the relatively low energy prices in the United States have attracted at least one of the leading chemical companies in Germany, BASF.
374	11	"and Spain. While the German government has caused the costs of the obligation to use renewable energy in electricity users, Spain has transferred that load to electricity companies. The combination of a highly-subsidized renewable energy generation and the requirement for electricity to buy renewable energy left in 2012 these companies with a deficit of $7.3 billion, which are added to the deficit accumulated during the last decade of $34,040 million. In addition to all that, green jobs still have to cause an impact on unemployment in Spain and in fact it is calculated that 2.2 jobs have been lost for each ""green"" job created by the subsidies. Spain is only behind Greece in terms of unemployment in the European Union. Therefore, it is not a surprise that the Spanish government has gone back in the exorbitant subsidies to wind and solar energies, thus exploding the solar bubble and leaving those who invested in solar energy (including those who saw it as a practically risk-free investment for their retirement) without anything."
374	13	and Africa. Unlike other countries that have created their own problems, many African countries have fallen victims of carbon dioxide reduction plans. Carbon dioxide emitting fuels have taken millions of people out of poverty, but not in Africa, where some governments and environmental groups have worked with developed countries to try to “compensate” their own carbon dioxide emissions and divide the land into “carbon grasses” and forestry projects. In some cases, this has forced farmers to sign strict land use contracts that excludes them from a more productive agriculture. Other programs have even expelled people from their homes to leave space to CO2-friendly forests. Basically, rich and developed nations have paid the Africans to continue to be poor and help developed nations feel better when emitting carbon dioxide.
374	15	With both anticipated and unexpected costs of climate change programs becoming patents worldwide, the United States should reject such economically temerary plans in favor of environmental benefits on the other hand unpreciable from reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Someone has always to pay the invoice, whether it is companies, consumers, taxpayers or politically indefenced. This is one of the reasons why it makes sense to let the market (i.e. companies and their customers) make decisions about how our energy is obtained and how much it costs.
374	17	And another good reason is this: no matter how well intended it is, when it comes to planning and ordering our energy options in a centralized way, the government does a better job by ruining things than by arranging them.
375	1	Zelenski “The Evil”
375	3	There are people who, when they don’t like a person, try to discredit her at any price, even if they have to invent disparate issues that, apparently, there is no one who creates them.
375	5	This is what happens now with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenski and a supposed translation of his surname and name, in that order. On social networks we can find a capture of a alleged conversion from the Ukrainian to the Spanish that would result “the evil is the owner of the world.”
375	7	"It is assured that the phrase arises if the surname is part and then the name and is placed on an Internet translator in this way: ""zele"", ""nsky"", ""volody"", ""myr""."
375	9	"If it is true, that it is not, since it is a bull, Volodimir Zelenski would be ""the evil"" from the cottage and in general also his father's family, at least. Furthermore, his parents would be fully in the need to demonize him, since they would have been bothered by completing his satanic circumstances with the right name."
375	11	"It’s all false, in addition to a rush. Volodímir Zelenski does not translate into Spanish as ""the evil is the owner of the world"" under no logical circumstances. You can try to put the name on the Google translator or in which it is and leave it in the way you want, that a translation will not appear in such a way. Moreover, it does not have a literal translation to Spanish, although it can be searched on the basis of parts of the name."
375	13	"This issue is seen on social networks, especially on Twitter, since this month of October, sometimes adhered with a phrase like ""Someone has seen this??? You have to separate the name of the dicious president from the country of fashion and then translate it!!! It is literally translated ""The evil is the owner of the world."""
375	15	As we see, the “bad” Zelenski doesn’t fall well to those who are spreading this bull, but manipulating a capture is very easy, and bringing him false arguments, too. Trying to convince the world of this, it seems that the same, because actually there are dozens of people who have believed it and did it yours.
375	17	Since Russia started the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the bulls that have served Volodymyr Zelensky have been crowded, as we have been able to verify in Bulocracy.
375	19	He has exalted his false gay past in New York, he has been called a murderer for shooting in the Ukrainian Parliament, when it was a picture of a film in which he participated in 2016, he has been dressed with the SS Nazi uniform and a football shirt with the swastika on his back, or he has been said he participated along with his wife in a musical called Endless Love.
375	21	"This now satanizing him directly is a new round of torture and puts it in a very high list for future bulls about Zelenski, because finding something to attribute him worse than being ""the evil"" seems difficult."
376	1	Erdogan 'convences' Putin to regain grain exports
376	3	Ukraine-Russia War: Last Minute
376	5	Russia recruits Afghan soldiers for invasion of Ukraine
376	7	The fear that Russia would withdraw from the agreement for the safe circulation of agricultural products through the Black Sea was dissolved thanks to the decisive intervention of the President of Turkey. After days of intense contacts between Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the de facto mediator between Ukrainians and Russians, and the main stakeholders in the mechanism approved last July, the Kremlin has confirmed that it will resume its participation in the agreed device. The decision reduces the risk of a rise in grain prices.
376	9	According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia through a statement, its government obtained the “necessary guarantees” from Ukraine of “not using the humanitarian corridor established by the agreement, and the Ukrainian ports designated for the export of agricultural goods, to launch military operations against the Russian Federation.” The message also detailed that Turkey, and a non-mentioned international organization, helped launch such commitments by Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenski.
376	11	"A renowned Turkish journalist, Ragip Soylu, told Putin that ""taking in mind the Turkish neutrality in the conflict and the capacities of Turkey's grain processing industry,"" his country would not hinder the grain exports, of which the Turks benefit singularly. Erdogan has confirmed that, from midnight in the afternoon of Wednesday, merchants will return to circulate through the established route. This was the case with Putin and Zelensky."
376	13	On Sunday, after a massive air and naval drone attack on the port of Sebastopol, Moscow said it was suspending its participation in the agreement. According to the report, Russian and Ukrainian officials must be present at an inspection center based in Istanbul. There they inspect the ships that come out and enter the Black Sea, which runs on a safe route. The aim is to ensure the safety of the ships and that they do not carry weapons to Ukraine.
376	15	In the talks that allowed the signing of these pact, the UN and Turkey played a preponderant role. Since the beginning of the invasion, Ankara, which has remained on the edge of the wide front of sanctions approved by the West, has tried to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. Conscious of how much he can lose in this war, and taking advantage of his proximity to both Russians and Ukrainians, Erdogan’s government has even managed to gather foreign ministers from both countries.
376	17	His success as a mediator has been uneven. Although it has failed to stop the invasion, and the political contacts between Kiev and Moscow are almost broken before the successive Russian massacres or the Ukrainian refusal to make territorial concessions, the agreement for the export of agricultural products has resulted, so far, a success. The contacts of the last days have allowed to confirm, in addition, the Turkish ability to overcome a crisis that threatened directly the global food price.
376	19	"The UN, the other relevant actor in this crisis, welcomed the march behind Russia. Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, stressed that Guterres ""continue engaged with all the actors in the full implementation of the initiative and its renewal"", scheduled for the end of this month. He also expressed his commitment to “eliminate the obstacles to the exports of Russian fertilizer and food,” one of the Kremlin’s demands as a counterpart to his support for the pact."
376	21	But, in this war, nothing more to sort a crisis another takes over the horizon. According to U.S. intelligence sources, cited by the New York Times, Russian generals discussed the possibility of an attack using nuclear weapons of the so-called tactical. The White House spokesman, John Kirby, said that “there is no sign that Russia is preparing for such use.”
376	23	In the same press conference, Kirby wanted to make it clear that his country “continue monitoring in the best way possible” the movements of Russia, which this week ended the partial mobilization of Russian men announced last September. “We have made it clear from the beginning that Russia’s comments about the potential use of nuclear weapons are deeply concerning, and that we take them very seriously,” Kirby said.
376	25	In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, the Russian government also seemed to want to transmit some calm around its military discussions. “We fully reaffirm our commitment to the joint statement of the leaders of the five nuclear weapons holders on the prevention of nuclear war and avoiding a weapons race from January 3, 2022,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
377	1	Russian forces launch projectiles against a experimental nuclear reactor in Jarkov
377	3	- Consequences Nuclear power plants as a strategic weapon: Is there a risk of another Chernobyl in Ukraine?
377	5	The IAEA proposes a meeting in Chernobyl with Ukraine and Russia to pact security guarantees on nuclear plants
377	7	Russia bombs Zaporiyia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, and is under its control.
377	9	Authorities in the Ukrainian province of Jarkov on Sunday denounced the impact of projectiles launched by the Russian forces on the National Research Center of the Institute of Physics and Technology, where there is a experimental nuclear reactor.
377	11	"""On March 6th, the Russian army shot with a rocket launch on the Jarkov Institute of Physics and Technology where there is a nuclear research facility,"" the Ukrainian secret services branch (SBU) said in a statement. There are 37 nuclear fuels on the site, so it could cause ""a large-scale ecological catastrophe,"" the SBU warns, so a criminal investigation for an ecocide crime has been opened in accordance with article 441 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code."
377	13	The SBU has stressed that it continues to collect information for its subsequent presentation in the Hague, headquarters of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (TPI).
377	15	"The OIEA, ""deeply"" concerned about Zaporiyia"
377	17	"The International Atomic Energy Organization (OIEA) on Sunday expressed its ""deep concern"" for the information that the communication with the Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporiyia, the largest in Europe, which Russia took on Friday, had been interrupted."
377	19	The IAEA, the United Nations nuclear activity surveillance agency, said in a statement that the Ukrainian government informed him that the headquarters of that central, located in the southeast of Ukraine, were under the orders of the Russian forces.
377	21	Kiev also said that the Russian military had cut down some mobile networks and the internet and that the telephone lines, e-mail and fax had ceased to work.
377	23	According to Ukrainian authorities, only mobile communications could be carried out, though of poor quality, the OIEA said.
377	25	“I’m extremely concerned about the events I’ve been today,” said OIEA Director-General Rafael Grossi. “To be able to operate the plant with total safety, the management and staff must be authorized to perform their tasks, vital, in stable conditions, without an undue intervention or external pressure.”
377	27	In addition, the IAEA indicated that the Ukrainian nuclear regulator had explained that he could only communicate by email with the staff of the Ukrainian central station in Chernobyl, which was taken by Russian soldiers on February 24.
377	29	As it appears, employees can no longer make turn rotations, so Grossi insisted on “the importance that workers can rest to perform their important tasks with total safety.”
377	31	Ukraine has four active nuclear power plants, which produce half of the country’s electricity consumption, and several nuclear deposits such as Chernobyl.
378	1	Ukraine strikes Russia by inviting Putin to a wedding
378	3	After tripling the airstrikes on Ukraine in October, Russia has been forced this week to reconsider its military strategy after Vladimir Putin has received the invitation to a wedding that will be held in Kiev within a month. The Kremlin suspects that the ceremony, which will force Putin to move to Ukraine in order not to get bad with the boyfriends, has been orchestrated by the army of Zelensky.
378	5	"“To the wedding you’ll have to go because they don’t have any fault and my wife would not accept any excuse because she always says that if they invite you to a wedding you’ll have to go,” Putin acknowledged, without hiding his frustration. Russian intelligence services admit that ""there's no way to prove"" that the wedding is a farce, but it's clear that the invitation forces Russia to interrupt its offensive and clearly threatens Putin's integrity, forced to enter enemy territory with his best gals."
378	7	“The worst thing is not to stop the war, but to decide the gift and organize the agenda.” She also suspects that “the money we pay for the wedding cover will be used to finance the Ukrainian troops.”
378	9	While protesting for the “dirty game” of Ukraine, “which violates all the rules of a combat confrontation”, Russia acknowledges that “not attending the wedding of Anastasia and Davyd would be a dishonour and would harm the image of our country, transmitting weakness.”
378	11	At the end of the edition, Volodymir Zenlenski was still unconfirmed whether he has also received the invitation, but sources from his surroundings promise that, if he coincides with Putin at the ceremony, “will keep the forms” because “wives don’t have to pay the price of a war and it’s the most important day of their lives.”
379	1	The desolation leads governments to ask citizens to accommodate the glaciers in their homes
379	3	“In the mountains they can no longer be because they disappear.” According to global warming experts, glaciers have lost an average of 267 gigatonelates of ice each year over the past 20 years. There is no more remedy than to act, and the emergency solution agreed by the main Western governments is to ask the citizens to accommodate at least a glacier in their home.
379	5	Experts explain that “this winter people will go cold because there is no gas or it’s very expensive, so private houses are now a more suitable ecosystem than ever to host glaciers.”
379	7	Among the recommendations provided by experts, the need to take the glacier to walk at least three times a day, cover it with aluminum paper to keep the temperature, ensure that they don’t lose a lot of water or a lot of ice, remove them from any source of heat and, in general, keep them in a fresh and dry place.
379	9	“To be blocks of a billion tons doesn’t mean they’re not fragile or they don’t need care,” they remember.
379	11	The governments point out that this urgent measure should be compatible with other equally essential practices, such as glass recycling. “Glass packages don’t need to stay living at home; when used, they have to move to the iglu,” they explain.
