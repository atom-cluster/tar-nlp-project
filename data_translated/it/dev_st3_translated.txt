2610	1	More than 1 million illegal immigrants from the U.S. since Biden is at power
2610	3	You can legitimately wonder how can a head of state want to stand on the battlefields when he is unable even to control his country? This seems like Joe Biden’s case with a problem that Americans feel much more pressing than the conflict in Ukraine. According to a survey conducted by the Quinnipiac University of Hamden, Connecticut, the first place in U.S. concerns would be inflation (31%), the second uncontrolled immigration (10%), the third electoral laws (8%) and only the fourth conflict in Ukraine (7%). The respondents' hearing is not camped in air, since Democratic Joe Biden was president of the United States the number of illegal immigrants in the country has increased by 1 million, arriving to cost citizens' pockets $9.4 billion. The data was released by Fox News, which obtained them from a U.S. Federation for Immigration Reform study. The research estimates that there are about 15.5 million immigrants living illegally in the United States, compared to 14.5 million in 2020. Other estimates have set the number to about 11 million. The U.S. Federation for Immigration Reform analysis also conducted a study of the tax costs of the phenomenon, finding that illegal immigrants are imposing a net tax burden of at least 143.1 billion, with an increase of $9.4 billion compared to 2020.
2610	4	According to the study, the reasons for this increase in illegal immigration should be investigated in three factors. The first, the improvement of the American economy that has attracted hundreds of thousands of immigrants, from Latin America. Secondly, the re-opening of the borders, expected by many after the health crisis by Covid19. This has led to a large number of illegal people in the United States who did not wait until Washington reopen the borders. Finally, the most important reason, the fact that the Biden administration has abolished much of the laws promulgated during the administration led by Donald Trump. To make a quick comparison, between 2016 and 2019, the number of immigrants who have become indetermined residents has decreased by 13%, from 1.18 million to 1.03 million. The geographical area most highlighting this decline is Asia: immigration has decreased by 21%, from 450,000 to 350,000 people. Between 2016 and 2019, arrivals from Yemen are -71%; from Iraq to -67%; from Buthan to -63%; from Iran to -53%; from Somalia to -40%; from Pakistan to -29%; from Afghanistan to -16%.  These data are the result of travel ban, also known as Muslim ban, President Trump’s executive orders to limit the entry into the United States of potential terrorists from countries to Islamic majority. “President Biden and the people he appointed for key positions in his administration have pursued the most radical border opening policies in the history of any sovereign nation, and these new numbers confirm it,” the President of the Federation for Immigration Reform, Dan Stein, said in a statement accompanying the report.
2610	5	The study says that the states with the largest number of illegal immigrants are California (3.3 million), Texas (2.2 million), Florida (1,2 million) and New York (1,1 million). The countries with the lowest number of illegal immigrants are North Dakota and West Virginia, with 6,000 each.
26100	1	It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do.
26100	3	Milan is in poverty. And all the welfare goes to immigrants. Not only clandestines, even the working immigrants do underpaid jobs in which they replace the Italians just for this their availability, and then their children must beined by the subsidies paid with the taxes of the Italians themselves unemployed because of them.
26100	5	They are almost a thousand. At almost a hundred euros a day they make more than 30 million euros.
26100	7	“In Milan we have about 950 unaccompanied foreign minors, and with the summer they will increase: numbers are very high that make it difficult to give a quality response. “Milan is an attractor, it needs a national government so that every local entity makes its own part.” This is more than that of at least eighty thousand arrived in the city from Ukraine, hosted “90% by families to which a support is needed”, the urgent problem “of welcoming, also educational” by the municipal counselor to Welfare Lamberto Bertolè. It is not a case if the municipality has frozen for two months 49 million Welfare spending to be able to close the budget in red: every minor immigrant costs the double of an adult. and huge numbers.
26100	9	To respond to the “social misfortune,” Minister of Labour Andrea Orlando emphasizes, “is also a way to take care of the difficulties of democracy.” In Lombardy in January more than 95 thousand families received citizenship income, for a total of 188 thousand beneficiaries; about 23 families and 42 thousand people in Milan. “The 40-50% of the Rdc spectors in Italy have a contract of employment,” the minister clarifies. “The poor work is even more dramatic where the cost of life is higher.”
26100	11	They import slaves and then complain of the ‘ poor labor’. The Deficient.
26104	1	Maskerine and school: how do you not get angry?
26104	3	"With the ocean crowds at recent concerts or celebrations in Milan and Rome, the accent on the use of masks in school makes it clear that there is a clear message of the ""best"" to the new generations. A way to punish and educate them as it would demonstrate the famous photo of Draghi and Zaia, strictly without, tormented by children of the masked elementary."
26104	5	It takes a reflection if, as it is almost certain, the “best” have not even managed to remove the absurd obligation for maturity exams!
26104	7	No internationally accredited study, so far, has managed to establish a correlation between the obligation of women in schools and the effectiveness of protecting themselves from covid infections. Even the latest Danish study did not find significant differences in the percentage of infected students between school districts with duty of maskery and districts where children can attend without any presidium.
26104	9	So why take our kids away from oxygen and freedom of expression, sociality and movement? This was explained by the sub-secretary to Health, Andrea Costa, in a statement that did not raise the due indignation and the deserved scalp: “The obligation of masking at school I don’t think it’s a thoroughly scientific choice, but it’s more a political interpretation.”
26104	11	Is this a kind of educational experiment?
26104	13	We have already been able to talk about the psychological bonus as a form of individual psychiatrization of a merely social discomfort, but we have not yet read the shame, worrying, conclusions arising from the joint meeting of Sinpia (Italian Society of Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) and Sinpf (Society of NeuroPsicoFarmacology) with the title: “Clinical Psychopharmacology in evolutionary age: effectiveness, safety and implications in the subsequent ages of life” which took place yesterday in Cagliari.
26104	15	"The discomfort of children and adolescents, turns into a ""disability of resilience"", which presents the prodroms of a future serious psychiatric disease, if not treated in time with medications."
26104	17	Let us take a few steps:
26104	19	“The pandemic not only increased the cases of psycho-emotional discomfort in young people but also doubled the access of patients to specialized centers and hospitals – explains Alessandro Zuddas, Vice President of SINPIA and Professor of Childhood and Adolescence Neuropsychiatry at the University of Cagliari –. In the absence of adequate social or health support from the teacher and other adults of extra-family reference (e.g. At the end of the day, we will be able to get a lot of money, and we will be able to get a lot of money and a lot of money. There have been various criticisms regarding this latter aspect: for example, unconformed prescription choices, aimed at effective and safe antidepressants or antipsychotics in adults, much less in children and boys.”
26104	21	Maybe after this premise the child neuropsychiatrist warns that it is NOT necessary to treat social discomfort with medications?  It is not the case, but it is not the case, it is not the case, it is not the case.
26104	23	In fact, it recommends other ad hoc drugs for children. “Today, however, we also have an important therapeutic armament for young people, of safe effectiveness as literary data show. This is the need for (in)education between the medical class and the population, parents and children.”
26104	25	"""If not treated, the disorders persist in adulthood"""
26104	27	Claudio Mencacci, Co-President of Sinpf and Emerite Director of Psychiatry at the Fatebenefratelli-Sacco Hospital in Milan, explains that “the prevalence of these disorders tends to increase with the growth of the child to reach a peak in adolescence and transcend in adulthood. However, it is estimated that only half of these disorders are properly diagnosed and that only a fifth of these can be taken into charge by the services of Childhood and Adolescence Neuropsychiatry. In addition to the lack of dedicated services, this is aggravated by the persistence of disinformation, taboo and social and cultural stigma that are difficult to overcome, with significant consequences on the child/adolescent; the frequent condition of comorbility with other psychiatric disorders contributes to complicating the clinical picture and the response to treatments.” “In addition, if it is true that with the pandemic the mental disorders in children and adolescents have increased, and that not rarely they go into acts of self-lesionism and suicide attempts, it is also true that an important role is that of parents, who should not hesitate to ask for help but address an expert dedicated to the emergence of an initial symptom or in the presence of difficulties in evolutionary age, to avoid the evolution towards a concluded pathology.”
26104	29	In other words, land land: if you experience discomfort, suffering, fear, depression, for having lived 3 winters between distant teaching and school masker, for not being able to play with your couples or celebrate a birthday, if you were no longer able to get to school or go to the cinema without leaving pass, if you were no longer able to see the grandparents because you are a possible enthusiast, if you are also experiencing a family and social climate of stress, hypocondria or apartheid, if your family is facing the dramatic consequences of pandemic management at the psychological and socio-economic level and now look with fear the future of a war economy....
26104	30	"Therefore, you are potentially a psychiatrically ill adult and it is best not to waste time, you need to take psychopharmaceuticals ""adjust to your age..."""
26104	32	We approach more and more quickly and unconsciously the U.S. social model, where a living child is treated with the diagnosis of hyperactivity, where those who fail with the goal of success are guilty, disadapted, unapproved, to marginalize, dangerous symptom of a way of feeling unconform.
26104	34	It is the case of a child who has been arrested with his handbags and placed in the gonna by a video recorded and broadcast on the net by the same forces of the order.
26104	36	"The child had sent SMS to the school threatening to make a strike. According to Skytg24, “the threat follows the strike at the Uvalde primary school in Texas, where a twelve-year-old opened fire and killed 21 people. It was the same sheriff to publish on the social officials of the police station the video of the child’s arrest. In the film you see an agent carrying the baby handmade inside the police car. “This student’s behavior is disgusting, especially after the recent Uvalde tragedy in Texas. “To ensure that our children are safe is crucial. We will have law and order in our schools. My team did not hesitate a second,"" Marceno wrote on Facebook. "
26104	38	"But do you doubt that the true guilty is this social model, which would also want to be an example to the world, is so difficult or is it incapable of the ""novax-Putin"" stigma?"
26107	1	99% did not want the Green Pass to be extended, and they actually extended it. Democracy in Europe
26107	3	As you know, since we have dedicated to the topic several articles, on the proposal of the European Commission, the European Parliament voted yesterday, as planned, the renewal of the EU Digital Covid certificate for another year. The vote was 453 favored, 119 against and 19 opposed.
26107	5	The expiry of the certificate regulation was scheduled for June 30. Earlier this month, a Parliament delegation had already reached a “political agreement” with the Commission on the renewal of the certificate, making yesterday’s vote practically counted.  The fun thing, and that makes it clear how much people are interested in the EU, is that the Commission had held a public consultation whose results were extremely negative. The consultation collected more than 385,000 answers, almost all against the renewal!
26107	7	In a letter to the European Ombudsman which the French deputy Virginie Joron posted on her Twitter profile, Joron writes:
26107	9	I read hundreds of answers by chance with my team. I did not find any of them in favour of the extension of the QR code [i.e. the digital certificate]. Based on this extensive survey, it seems obvious that almost all the answers were negative.
26107	11	The negative tendency of the answers has been evident from the beginning. The first full page of answers, all from February 4, is available here. I am, of course, in the different languages of the European Union: French, German, Italian and also one in English.
26107	13	To give readers an idea of the content, here is the translation of one or two lines of the first answers (from the bottom of the page):
26107	15	I am completely against the creation of this certificate, given what is currently happening with the disastrous management of Covid by the EU.
26107	17	I want this cst [probably a reference to the “Covid Safe Ticket” of Belgium] or vaccine passport to be simply removed...
26107	19	In the document box there are statements that are not scientifically supported. For example, it is claimed that the Covid certificate represents an effective protection against the spread of the virus – what data can support this claim?...
26107	21	Hello, I am shocked and disgusted by the decisions that kill the freedom taken in the EU... as regards this “European certificate”...
26107	23	I will never be subject to a discriminatory certificate again.
26107	25	And so through 385.191 answers, almost all negative.
26107	27	Of course, as the answers are almost all negative and opposite, the Commission has decided the opposite: it has reached an agreement to continue it. Because, in the end, nothing interests what Europeans think of the Commission. What is important is your agenda.
26108	1	Netherlands: 30,000 farmers around with tractors to protest government’s environmental policy loyalties
26108	3	The imposition of the environmental policies of the government Rutte, a minority, telecomanded by Brussels, is creating profound protests in the country, because it risks to eradicate a consistent part of its agricultural economy. This brought 30 thousand farmers on the highways with so many tractors. Here are some videos, which were obviously ignored in Italy of the impressive gathering.
26108	5	The protests arise from the imposition of an absurd regulation by the government against the emission of greenhouse gases, in this case based on nitrogen and ammonia, compounds that are essentially derived from the breeding of animals. The government’s goal is to reduce the raised heads by 30%, but this, of course, would result in the closure of a large number of farms, some of which multi-centenary. All this will be sacrificed in the name of the ideology of the new European Soviet Union and its centralized programming.
26108	7	The Netherlands are traditional meat exporters to the rest of Europe, so there will be heavy declines on the prices of these foods in other countries. The Rutte government is well aware that there will be very heavy crashes on these companies, but it has nevertheless stated that... nothing interests him, that companies have to change and that the legislation will be implemented anyway. What will these farmers sacrificed on the altar of climate change do? They will attack the tram, or they will move to even stronger forms of protest.
26108	9	Of course, of these declines of the Commission’s environmental policies you’ll never hear anything in Italy, where they invite on TV only extreme environmentalists who don’t live from their work.
2611	1	Washington is ready to make sanctions wars until the last European war
2611	3	Even the closest U.S. allies are starting to escalate while trying to avoid the fate of those who will be sacrificed in the sanctions wars with Russia.
2611	4	This situation is already causing a particular anger both in Washington and London, where they are proposing with force and determination to “punish” those countries that are not actively “fighting” against Russia.
2611	5	British economists ask Germany to impose an immediate embargo on Russian hydrocarbons. They define their purchases of Russian gas and oil as the funding of the Russian army.
2611	6	In case of rejection, Berlin is threatened by sanctions by Washington, London and Brussels. And it doesn’t matter that the sanctions have already led to an increase in manufacturing inflation to 31% – and the embargo on oil and gas could buri the German economy.
2611	7	Similar threats are also sent to Hungary, which has also been prevented from receiving financial assistance from Brussels, and threaten consequences forining neutrality in Ukraine.
2611	8	In London, they are already ready to say that the purchase of German goods is becoming like supporting Russia, since they were produced with the help of Russian energy carriers. If so, then it is time to limit their access to the markets of the United States and Britain.
2611	9	Similar reports have already been made in Washington regarding Israel, its closest ally. The “falches” in Congress, usually pro-Israelians, changed the tables in the conditions of the Ukrainian crisis and began to threaten Jerusalem with the imposition of sanctions and the freezing of U.S. military aid for a amount of $3 billion a year. The reason is Israel’s refusal to adhere to Western sanctions.
2611	10	India, which remains neutral and purchases oil from Russia, is under no less pressure. The United States has suddenly begun to accuse her of human rights violations. We can soon expect threats of sanctions, already applied in the past against India because of the allegations of discrimination against Muslims.
2611	11	As the consequences of sanctions wars affect the economy, the desire to participate in these wars is rapidly decreasing. Also in the UK the share of supporters of sanctions has decreased from 50% to 36% in a month. And the more insistent will be the pressure of America, which acts according to the well-known logic: you die today in the war with Russia, and I will die tomorrow. If necessary, Washington is ready to launch sanctions wars until the last European.
26112	1	“The Great Game” II: British activity in Ukraine
26112	3	Geopolitics is a game on a fixed shaker in which not only the main players change, but also the colors of the pieces, and the rules themselves are fluid. Although the basic mechanisms remain unchanged and some plots return years or even centuries later to remind us that the Game of Thrones takes place invariably in front of our eyes, usually too distracted to notice the contours. Again, British agents appear in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to persuade natives to declare war to Russia so that Britain regains its dominant position, first in Europe and finally in the Middle East. The game continues.
26112	5	Distribution of Roles
26112	6	Only people who fail to recognize the changes in international politics can still think that the Ukrainian game is implemented by (only) Russia and the United States. for nothing. Of course, the American hegemony stillins general control over the entire geopolitics of the Western Hemisphere, but its stumbling economy forces the division of labour. The reality is that if the U.S. will not focus on the Chinese issue, they will not only lose the primate (now broken) of the world’s largest economy, but will also be detronized as the most important center of the global capital, which is already considered in the process of change from the supported side.
26112	8	If Wall Street once replaced (partly) the City, today the possibility remains on the table to move the main weight of global finance over Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing. Since China is already the world’s main industrial center, the concentration of elements of the great capital decisions could save the consumer form of capitalism known as Fordism, dominant since the end of World War II. And all this while the United States and the UK are already implementing a major transformation of capitalism under the shoulder of the COVID-19 and the climate crisis. The Americans have to turn to face these challenges, by focusing on the Far East and the Pacific, otherwise they can get a almost deadly football in their back.
26112	10	The Empire continues to hit.
26112	11	However, Washington has not dominated and paralyzed Europe for so many decades to leave it today without the illuminated guidance of the Anglo-Saxon. History and geopolitics have closed the circle, as we see a bizarre, but absolutely serious attempt to restore the British Empire. Not the Americans, but the British are the main opponents of Russia in Ukraine. In fact, Westminster has taken full control of the foreign policy (including energy security) of Poland and the Baltic states. The British presence is more than visible on the historic Battlefield of the Great Game, i.e. in Central Asia. Every week it brings new evidence of Britain’s increasing involvement in the conflict with Russia.
26112	12	A further Boris Johnson’s visit to Kiev is recognized in the UK as a proposal that cannot be rejected by Volodymyr Zelensky: that the Ukrainians don’t even think of any other scenario than entering the organized blockade under British leadership with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (and probably Moldova and Romania). The second level of the same plan would be UkroPolin, a Polish-Ukrainian hybrid state, promoted in Polish and Ukrainian politics, especially by politicians openly controlled by the British Embassy. And, of course, the last act of the operation would probably be to launch all this alliance against Russia.
26112	14	New Colonies of the Old Empire
26112	15	England is increasing its assets in Ukraine. While Kiev was preparing to attack Russia, the British trained at least 22,000 Ukrainian soldiers (Operation Orbital). Now Prime Minister B. Johnson has promised to form 10,000 more, probably in Poland. Since February, Westminster has transferred £1.3 billion to Kiev, supplied thousands of NLAW missiles, launchers and artillery systems, including NATO’s M109. The foolish final of the Eurovision Song Contest, which will be hosted by Ukraine next year, will also be on stage in the UK. Moreover, Ukraine will emerge with Poland in UkroPolin, but only to turn it into British colonies.
26112	17	War propaganda in the UK may not be primitive as in Poland or Lithuania, but almost as intense, although at least there are some independent voices tolerated also by the left (the British Workers' Party of George Galloway, the Corbynists of the Resistance of Chris Williamson Movement), that by the right ( popular writer and blogger conservative Peter Hitchens ). However, censorship reaches universities and mainstream media pursue with passion any public criticism of the rise of imperialism.
26112	19	The Russian-British War?
26112	20	However, the pro-Kiev wave in the UK seems to fall down and common English and Scottish families are wondering about delays in paying the so-called “thank” for welcoming Ukrainian immigrants in their homes (many English and Scottish families are still waiting for the 350 pounds promised a month). It doesn’t matter much, because “the oldest (liberal) democracy in Europe” is no longer democratic, nor favourable to freedom of speech, and the political and financial establishment without means affirms that the United Kingdom itself is in war with Russia.
26112	22	The game is back. Today it plays not only in the diplomacy, on the battlefields and in the fighting of the secret services, but also in a virtual dimension. The techniques vary, but the domain is always in order. Only one empire can survive and, when it cannot, it prefers to divide to prevent the end of the Anglo-Saxon hegemony. As Sir William Harcourt once said to the young Winston Churchill, “Nothing happens...”.
26116	1	Bonino: Italy must import 400,000 migrants a year to replace Italy
26116	3	Bonino and Calenda should be arrested for great betrayal. Those who propose ethnic subversion through immigration – which is genocide by other means – should not have a place in civil life.
26116	5	Integrate more immigrants to save the Italian demographic balance. Italy is a sovereign country. Japan, with zero immigration, has no security and social status issues.
26116	7	If we just wanted to ‘save the demographic balance’ with immigration, we should only allow time-to-time workers to enter and then they would be replaced by rotating every five years by younger workers. Instead, we host 2.5 million unemployed immigrants: children, wives, parents and various parasites. It is a cost, not a balance.
26116	9	Italy does not need any other immigrants. It has been released from 2.5 million economic and social parasites. And to replace the remaining 2.5 million with unemployed Italians and the descendants of Italians in South America.
26116	11	The Bonino, for years with the Radicals funded by Soros, has been one of the artifacts of the demographic emptiness that now denounces.
26116	13	Thanks to you and those like you we lack a few million Italians. That now you and those like you want to replace with Africans from the IQ that would make us slide into a future well painted in the movie Idiocracy. It was wrong before and it is wrong now. Otherwise we would not have 30% of young people unemployed. The reality is that, despite the demographic emptiness, we still have “too many” young people. 
26116	15	We need a Nuremberg, not a Draghi government.
26118	1	Orsini at Draghi’s Attack: “The Brake in Meeting with Zelensky”
26118	3	Professor Alessandro Orsini, professor of Sociology of International Terrorism, has no doubt: “Draghi is cheating the Italians in agreement with Biden.”
26118	5	A concept that the teacher, accused of being a putinian thread and practically at the top in the various “prospection lists” that have come out in these months on some intelligence bodies and journalists considered friends of Moscow, reiterated yesterday evening in the point of Non is L’Arena conducted by Massimo Giletti on La7.
26118	7	Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, Professor Orsini has denounced what he believes is the false narration of the West about the true reasons of the war, demonstrating how the United States and NATO have actually been provoking Russia for years and causing its reaction to Ukraine. It was not the only one to say it, but it has become the symbol of the Italian intellectual to be hated as capable of defending what the West has now identified as the “new Hitler.” He was attacked to the right and to the lack, with so many parliamentary courses to ask for his obscurity from the television channels, to begin with those of the public service, adding the pretext that Rai is paid with the money of the Italians even though some pseudo-liberal politicians remember it always when it makes them comfortable.
26118	9	Orsini, however, did not let himself be intimidated and continued his crucifixion, denouncing the guilt of the West and dismantling what the narrative defines as farlock about the Ukrainian conflict wrapped by the mainstream system. According to his judgment, there would be “a obvious gap between what we feel and what really happens” and this because there would be power centers that would manipulate Western information. And yesterday night from Giletti he started the attack of Prime Minister Draghi.
26118	11	He said, “Mario Draghi has fooled the Italians.” Why? How to?“I would like the president of the Council to put himself in the shadows of the Italians,” Orsini explained, “in Italy there is a very clear command chain, with Biden making decisions, then there is Stoltenberg and then Draghi.”
26118	13	“Every time Zelensky meets a flower, he asks for weapons, especially heavy, but we don’t talk about it with the heads of state.” The reference is to the meeting that Draghi had with the President of Ukraine together with Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany, and Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic.
26118	15	“At that time, the President of Ukraine did not ask for weapons – said Orsini – and did not because they agreed.” And here is, according to the professor, Draghi’s “blind” that he would call Zelensky asking him not to advance the request for other weapons, considering the problems that the topic raises in the parliamentary majority that supports the Italian government (this is yesterday’s confrontation between the Minister of Foreign Affairs Luigi di Maio and the M5S that would even want to challenge him). At least until the next parliamentary passage when, as always happened, the prime minister will try to make the minestry off to the parties that support it.
26118	17	Orsini finally explained that Draghi’s is just a tactic to take time and overcome any crisis in Parliament: “To make the perfect embrace, what must Draghi do? He must authorize the Parliament, scaval it,” he attacks again, and then continues: “In other words – he added – he must put himself in the perfect condition to genufle in Biden. And to do this, he must make sure that the Parliament does not put a mouth on the conduct of the war in Ukraine.” The goal of the prime minister in the end, according to the teacher, would only be to “fregate the Italians and find an escamotage to send heavy weapons every time the U.S. asks for it.”
26118	19	It is a serious accusation that would demonstrate the degree of Italy’s submission to the United States. First of all, it is the economic interests of Italy. For, as Orsini always explains, “the more the war will go ahead and the more problems will be for the Italian economy.”
26118	21	One thing is certain, Orsini doesn’t seem at all intimidated by the attacks received, nor by inserting Putin’s friends lists. He then launched a challenge to Giletti: “Pray paper and penna, let’s make the calculation of international policy experts who in Italy speak well about the government saying that Draghi doesn’t make anything wrong and who does the opposite,” also denouncing the consequences and intimidations that would be subjected to those who like him reason differently. But this is not a novelty, since since the times of the war in Iraq has always been hard the lives of the correspondents who came out of the seed of the official narrative. The real news is that there are those who resist, despite everything.
26119	1	St. Petersburg puts the foundation for the Economic Corridor War
26119	3	"In St. Petersburg, the new world powers gathered to capture the ""rule-based order"" chosen by the United States and re-connect the world in their way."
26119	5	The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum has been established for years as absolutely essential to understanding the evolving dynamics and the evidence and tribulations of the integration of Eurasia.
26119	7	St. Petersburg in 2022 is even more crucial as it connects directly to three simultaneous developments that I had previously defined, in missing order:
26119	9	"First, the arrival of the ""new G8"" - four BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), plus Iran, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico, whose GDP for equal purchasing power (PPA) already makes the old, dominated by the Western G8."
26119	11	"Second, the Chinese strategy of the ""Three Rings"" for the development of geo-economic relations with its neighbors and partners."
26119	13	Third, the development of BRICS+ or BRICS extended, including some members of the “new G8”, to be discussed at the next summit in China.
26119	15	There was no doubt that President Putin would be the protagonist of St. Petersburg 2022, speaking a brief and detailed speech at the plenary session.
26119	17	Among the highlights, Putin has destroyed the illusions of the so-called “billion of gold” that lives in the industrialized West (only 12 percent of the world’s population) and the “irresponsible macroeconomic policies of the G7 countries.”
26119	19	"The Russian president noted that ""EU losses due to sanctions against Russia"" could exceed $400 billion a year and that the high energy prices in Europe - something that actually started ""in the third quarter of last year"" - are due to ""blindly believing in renewable energies""."
26119	21	He also duly rejected the Western propaganda of “Putin’s rise in prices,” saying that the food and energy crisis is linked to fucking Western economic policies, for example, “Russian grain and fertilizers are sanctioned” outside the West.
26119	23	In short, the West has badly judged Russia’s sovereignty when it has sanctioned it, and now it is paying a very high price.
26119	25	Chinese President Xi Jinping, referring to the forum via video, sent a message to the entire South of the world. He called for “true multilateralism,” insisting that emerging markets must have “voices in global economic management” and called for “a better north-south and south-south dialogue.”
26119	27	The President of Kazakhstan Tokayev, the deeply strategic partner of Russia and China, is expected to express personally the final battle: the integration of Eurasia should progress alongside the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China. This is the closed circle.
26122	1	NATO promises to defend Melilla from attacks but not Lampedusa
26122	3	However, an attack on the coast of Italy has been ongoing for decades from all sides. One of the “Allies” of NATO, Turkey.
26122	5	The ships arriving in Almeria witness Alger's intention not to control immigration, in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with Spain.
26122	7	Algeria sent a new warning to Spain on its “disappointment” in political matters, confirming the threat of not controlling the clandestine maritime route. The arrival of several small boats along the coast of Almeria showed the permissibility of Algeria, as expected by the state security forces when the Spanish government decided to renew diplomatic relations with Morocco last March and changed its position on the Sahara.
26122	9	In order to satisfy one supplier of clandestines they have disappointed another. It happens when you limit yourself to ask others to do what you should do.
26122	11	The migratory episode of yesterday in Almería – “which will not be the last,” according to the sources of the Civil Guard consulted by this newspaper – took place parallel to the closure of the NATO summit, whose order of day provided for the protection of the borders of Ceuta and Melilla, after the armed attack of the previous days.
26122	13	Nothing about Lampedusa. 
26122	15	What is it for Italy, an alliance that ‘defences’ us from an imaginary danger, the Russian tourists, and not the African-Islamic invasion? The only threat to the future is African-Islamic immigration. This must be combated, not Vlad.
26126	1	Great reset: at the end we will ask him for the lockdown
26126	3	The Italian information lies knowing how to lie, telling us the story of a Russia that would lose the war militarily and economically, to hide the catastrophe of a strategy that is putting on the knees the most fragile peoples in the West, among the first our, part of a front led by an old gentleman unlucky and telecomanded, literally placed at the head of the most powerful and at the same time decadent country in the world.
26126	5	It is all a lie: about the beginning and the origins of the conflict, about who is exacerbating and prolonging it, about who is losing and winning it. Even on the values that we Westerners will represent: as if the stories of Julian Assange or Shireen Abu Akleh could be deleted with scary and banal words.
26126	7	But what once again greatly affects is the ability of a dark (little) rule to take advantage of emergency parentheses to continue their class struggle from above to below, stealing the poor to give to the rich, re-designing the society in general to the image and resemblance of their squallid interests.
26126	9	As Draghi encounters the top of Uber and completely ignores the protests of taxis in the main squares of the country, he is preparing to pull off Italian beaches to small and medium-sized enterprises to trust them to large foreign multinational companies. And well on the point says Alessandro Somma, in the special of Byoblu to sign Gianuario, when he emphasizes as such measures if they had had the same impact on countries such as France or Germany would have been unthinkable: in fact, in light of the need to eventually review the conditions of the concessions, the change of model will mean shrinking and throwing away a century of Italian tradition, history and customs. What is bad, ask almost basics the usual narrative servants to unified networks, in wanting to entrust this sector to free competition? There is so bad: first because of the crucial nature of the industry in the culture of our country, second because it would compare our small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, who in many cases have realized those structures with the aspro sacrifice of several generations, with the large international multinational companies.
26126	11	I look forward to an Amazon-beach that puts on the roof Luca, the manager of the factory where I go to the sea every summer: simply unacceptable.
26126	13	And then the cost of life explodes: with fifty euros you go to the supermarket and just pay the air conditioned to keep the room fresh for a half hour, admit that you can’t get to reason even that. We then talk about the ration of energy, because of the sanctions that we would impose on Russia (it may seem a paradox, but on TV they teach us that freedom is paid, it is a privilege), and the last of the ration of water, because of the drought that divers us. In short, we will very likely have the CO2 emissions settlement for the next emergency parenthesis of environmental stamp.
26126	15	All possible forms of social control because someone will have to rule these rationals and nothing new under the sun or of annoying: after all we have even been accustomed now to the rationalization of civil rights, as decreased during the health crisis for years... and it vocifies that in autumn it starts like that. of course.
26126	17	And think about us a moment, taking for example the worker and the average worker: affected by a expensive unstable price, with stagnant wages because they ask the EU, the ECB and the Bank of Italy (although the trade unions silence complicated and guilty!With gasoline to the stars, with you that you have to do at least fifty kilometers a day to go and go back from work, what can be more providence and saving than a beautiful lockdown in autumn? We will surely find someone happy to satisfy us, in tremendous waiting for that moment.
26128	1	Population through vaccines
26128	3	After Germany where in the first three months of this year births have decreased by about 13 percent, making immediately think of a role of vaccines that have already known consequences on the reproductive system both female with known cycle disorders and male with reduced sperm number and mobility. A sudden and unprecedented decrease in the birth rate is also in other European countries such as Austria and Switzerland although for others the statistics are late to come, but now there is the clamorous case in Taiwan where the birth rate has dropped by 23.24% in May 2022, compared to May 2021.
26128	5	Just as in Germany as well as in Taiwan as you can see from the table the birth rate has remained constant for many years and then in 2022 it literally collapsed, a number of months after the tapestone vaccine campaigns. The numbers on the island are important because they are so high that they cannot be made to pass as causal oscillations even though extreme as the defenders of disappointment vaccines could make you try to believe: statistical mathematics does not allow it.
26128	7	In fact, having no possible justification from this point of view, we are trying to put together an operation on the type of long Covid, i.e. debiting the disease that is a consequence of the vaccines.  But in this case it is not so easy to fool people because, at least in Europe, as in much of the world, the phenomenon would have had to occur already from the early months of 2011 if the effect the decrease of birth was due to coronavirus infection. But in Taiwan it is even more impossible to support, because the island has not practically had covid in 2020 and 2021, but the disease has practically spread with vaccines, i.e. it has exploded since mid-April when 91 percent of the population was already vaccinated thanks to the uninterrupted inoculation campaigns of 2021.
26128	9	Even the latter of the cretins would understand that covid cannot be the cause of a crash of birth in the spring of this year, since as it seems from the latest research on television virologists it seems that pregnancy is about 9 months, but they prove us the same convinced that in the bottom people more than believe these stupidities, have a great fear to disubbid and above all to show themselves disubbid. In addition, the science has indelebably melted up of infamia and to realize it just read among other things this fact check of December 5, 2020 published by Reuters in which it claims that the vaccine is safe for pregnancy “because there is no evidence that it is not safe”. In fact, we know that there was no study, specific to pregnancy and fertility, it was simply told us that it was safe without knowing it.
26128	11	And maybe no: at this point some independent observers begin to believe that the vaccination of the youngest part of the population, that in fertile age, although completely useless given the minimum effects of the covid on it, has been specially planned to the purpose of a decrease of births that of the rest has been one of the promised goals of the vaccine prophet Bill Gates and of the whole part of the elite that is recognized in these dystopies by four money, by romance in edicola which is then the juice of the thoughts of a very rich but without culture and intelligence.
26128	13	Of course, the vast majority of the people who participated in the vaccine campaigns could not imagine such a sincere purpose, admit that it had been there and this will be seen from the duration of the conditions of difficult fertility due to the genetic serums. But I will tell you, two years ago I would be confused in the face of these theses, but after 24 months of absurdity and lies, then disguised that we would never expect to be able to endure, after the Fed’s attempt to hide the documentation on the approval of the Pfizer vaccine and then to release the documents in a way that takes us 75 years before we get to the truth, after the discovery of false and manipulations in clinical trials nothing can really be excluded. Without honesty and good faith.
2613	1	China is preparing for war
2613	3	The public opinion at this time focuses its attention on the war in Ukraine, which fairly affects the European continent. But what is happening in Asia has a much higher risk potential.
2613	5	China is preparing for an unprecedented mega Asian conflict in human history.
2613	6	From a satellite photo, as the other noticed yesterday the online press agency Insideover, it turns out that the People's Republic of China has built a new radar of early warning (early warning) long-range. The image was taken in February last by the commercial satellite image company Maxar Technologies and shows that the new Large Phased Array Radar, or Lpar, was built on the top of a mountain in the Yiyuan area, Shandong province, about 110 kilometers south-east of the city of Jinan. The new radar can give China a system of warning for ballistic missile launch from North Korea, South Korea, most of Japan and even some areas of the Russian Far East. This can give the reader an idea of the extent of the conflicts that China plans to face in the Asian continent.
2613	7	But it is not all.
2613	9	It was recently announced the news that the People's Republic of China and the Solomon Islands are about to conclude a defence agreement, which will allow the Chinese Navy to have a real military base in this country. There would be nothing special in itself, unless the Solomon Islands were situated in front of Australia, though at a distance of 2,000 kilometers.
2613	10	The Australian media and political representatives of the island-continent reacted with veemence: the Chinese base on the Solomon Islands is a “red line” and Australia will never tolerate the presence of the Chinese. The White House said that “the United States will act accordingly if China installs a military base on the Solomon Islands in the Pacific.”
2613	12	The United States, Britain and Australia have signed a anti-China treaty called Aukus. It is obvious that China, by installing a military-naval base in the Pacific Ocean, is preparing for a conflict also against the three countries of the Aukus Pact.
2613	13	What’s more surprising is that China says it doesn’t want a Third World War and supports the resolution of the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy, as said a few days ago Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Wang Wenbin, cited by the Russian agency Tass. In light of China’s preparations for the future Asian war, the Chinese spokesman’s statement sounds bitter. China would not want a Third World War, but if it was forced...
26131	1	Ukraine admits: Russia is winning, we withdraw
26131	3	“After the heavy battles for Lysychansk, Ukrainian defense forces were forced to leave the occupied positions and borders.” This was announced, with twenty-four hours of delay with a pathetic post on Facebook the major state of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in relation to the city, conquered yesterday by the Russian troops.
26131	5	"“In the face of the many advantages of the Russian troops in artillery, aviation, firearms, ammunition and personnel – it is the explanation of Lysychansk’s resignation – the continued defense of the city would lead to fatal consequences. In order to preserve the lives of the Ukrainian defenders, therefore, the decision was made to withdraw.""Today we continue our struggle. Unfortunately, steel will and patriotism are not enough to win, we need material and technical resources,” the post concludes, promising: “We’ll turn and we’ll absolutely win.”"
26131	7	You will return.
26131	9	The risk that the entire Luhansk region passes under Russian control “exists, this is clear,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted, answering the questions of journalists. The whole region was already in the hands of Russia.
26131	11	In the Luhansk region there is “the most complicated and dangerous situation. And there, it’s true, we’re not in advantage,” said the president, highlighting that yet in other areas of the country “we’re making steps forward.” Moreover, “the delivery of weapons will increase our advantage and also in this direction (the Luhansk, ndr) we will be able to push stronger.”
26131	13	You are in advantage only on social. In the real world it is a disaster.
26134	1	The anti-Putin dilemma of the German Greens: “How many minutes can the shower last?”
26134	3	But is Merkel, the famous “culon” washing it? It’s not a provocation and it’s not a pilgrimage question, the former chancellor being the main responsible (the reasons have been twisted often, on this space and on the Atlantic Twin) of the energy crisis that affects Europe. And now Germany is equipped with the German: the state claims to decide the frequency and duration of the douches, so to save in a blow only gas and water.
26134	5	The new environmental catechism
26134	7	There is a rich debate: on the one hand the liberals, few, reduced to an Indian reserve, scandalized by the Hegelian intrusion, on the other the progressists, too many, implacable, who demand: more state, more controls, less hygiene. You hear, for example, the Minister of Economy, who is a Green, an environmentalist, as to say that lazy politics is not just our thing: Robert Kabeck doesn’t want to impose anything on anyone, he says, but the alternative is unfortunately to the German: either give up, in fact, the shower, or make it another, based on Zyklon B.
26134	9	It is unnecessary to discuss: it has already won the neocommunism, new but always unclean, in the Netherlands they have decided to reduce from 10 to 5 minutes the time “given” under the ghetto: stuff that makes rabbit, but Kabeck laughs like a capo: “5 minutes? Too much, I’ve never worked so much, I’m fast.” And since this is washed to the Pradesh, everyone is forced to follow it. Of course, the media, starting with the Italians, are scattered in the usual way, something like the perpetual dose of the vaccine that most hurt, especially the children, and the more they make it inevitable. Read the bullets of the regime to believe.
26134	11	Of course, thirty years of European Union have done a great good to us: we are recruited to African tribal levels, with which,, many migrants will return back as once landed they find the same opportunities as at home. But who would have said it: from the summary care of the body, the daughter of the war, to the consumer explosion of cosmetics, skyscrapers, essences, to the resumption of the Marxist-Leninist-British stamp. How will all these unnecessary influencers do? You will disappear not depilated poses with the crosts in the high points?
26134	13	It is a particular case, the German debate – false, hypocrite, but at least timidly proposed – here is jumped to equal (and not washed). Chist is ‘the country of Fulco, a rich born who has found a way to stay in the world in ecologist fantazism; ‘the country of Alessandro Gassman, one who has a mission to spy, report, and that doesn’t carry the mask, and that other has not made the fifty dose, and that other has still washed, you understand? It was washed!
26134	15	The German proposal
26134	17	The vice president of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Kubicki, is blown: “I do it until I’ve finished and the times of Kabeck don’t shake me anything”; a little more and linen, CDU’s boss, Merz, who bushes the ZTL crucca, has come to argue that only the one who heats the water with solar energy will be able to wash: the poor can die from tifus. It’s crazy, and it’s scary, but returning to the daytime, money for two minutes including washing, is no longer an option: it’s a reality, and it doesn’t admit alternatives.
26134	19	After relaxing douches, thin and lazy baths, who can fill Dom Perignon's bath, the others all model Carola Rackete. Imagine the scenes on the corridors, on the transportation: the usual ass face that, behind six masks one over the other, points like a arm: sniff sniff, here you don’t feel puzzles: but you, sorry, when you washed the last time? The morning? But is he a criminal, he wants to kill us all? The man doesn’t know the shit. And the controller, who thinks of the Roman cassette: I’m sorry, he must go down, it’s the law. And they are ashamed.
26134	21	This bus is a gas room, this Europe is a leak, and this West is fought. From Berlin to Amsterdam, from Paris to Verona, where there is a remarkable case: for years, for decades under the balcony of Romeo and Juliet the national shame, the cave of neonazis, the cities to heal, some fascious and irrisory scripts made us an article a day, he also had to find himself a way to be in the world; then they choose the trade unionist footballer Tommasi, one of those who earned millions but always on a closed point, and Verona becomes the democratic avant-garde, the national jewel. What does Tommaso make you the first act? It raises the water, prohibits it, convinced in this way to save Veneto and the planet all from desert drought.
26134	23	As a populist stupidity, there is something to drive Greta to an hopeful orgasm. It is the most important thing that you can do when you’re going to get a lot of money, and you’re going to get a lot of money. Then, in autumn, a beautiful mega lockdown omnibus: health, social, war, climate, ecological, energy security. Garanted with lemon.
26134	25	This is us, this is the Union, this is the postcommunism always a little communist, that is, foolish. But yes, I’m sure that Merkel’s “culon” is going to shake it. The restrictions are valid only for the troops, they don’t, for the immeasurable excellences only the best, if then they don’t want to get rid is because they don’t want, because in their ecologist Leninist tanf they grumble well, not sure because someone imposes it on him.
26142	1	The United Nations: “A new record of greenhouse gas. We are out of the road.”
26142	3	"The annual report of the World Meteorological Organization records an annual growth rate higher than the 2011-2020 average, and this trend continues in 2021. ""This step increases temperature well above 1.5-2 °C"""
26142	5	Last year a new record of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere was reached, with an annual growth rate higher than the average of the period between 2011 and 2020, and this trend continues in 2021. The warning comes from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Nations agency, in the annual greenhouse gas report (carbon dioxide, methane and nitroxide) that catch the heat.
26142	7	 The increase in greenhouse gas concentrations puts the Paris Climate Agreement’s temperature targets at risk, UN Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said, warning: “We’re really out of the way.”
26142	9	 “The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin – added Taalas – contains a clear scientific message for climate change negotiators at the COP26. At the current rate of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, by the end of this century we will see a temperature increase that is far above the Paris Agreement targets from 1.5 to 2 °C above the pre-industrial levels.”
26142	11	" The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeded the target of 400 parts per million in 2015, the Secretary-General of the OMS reminds that ""only five years later, it exceeded 413 ppm. This is more than a simple chemical formula and figures on a graph. It has significant negative impacts on our daily life and our well-being, the state of our planet and the future of our children and grandchildren.”"
26142	13	" ""The carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean even longer - Taalas explained - The last time the Earth experienced a similar concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3 degrees Celsius warmer and the sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now. But then there were no 7.8 billion people,” Taalas said."
26142	15	 “Many countries are now setting carbon neutral targets and hopefully Cop26 will see a consistent increase in commitments. But we have to turn our commitment into actions that will have an impact on the gases that cause climate change. We need to review our industrial, energy and transport systems and the entire lifestyle. The necessary changes are economically accessible and technically possible. There is no time to lose,” Taalas said.
26143	1	Climate: The global warming will last long and the first victim may be the human being. It is revealed by a study
26143	3	Although several countries have taken action, thanks to the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming, there have been no significant improvements, in particular towards CO2 reduction. A study conducted by a group of researchers from the McGill universities of Quebec, Canada, Oxford, Leeds and New York, also by the Republic newspaper, hypothesized three future scenarios up to 2500. From what has emerged, taking into account some places such as the American Midwest (the grain of the world), the Amazon forest (the lungs of our planet) and the Indian subcontinent (the most populated area of the Earth), in the first scenario the monoculture of cereals could be replaced by subtropical plants such as the ananas, in the second the great forest could disappear and turn into a desert due to the lack of rain and, in the latter, in India, the intense heat could make hard the work of man outdoors by hypothesizing the use of protective clothes or even machines that completely replace the human being.
26143	5	These are apocalyptic scenarios as regards the three places considered by experts. But more generally, worldwide, vegetation could change drastically and agricultural production decreased. The sea level would continue to rise due to the accumulation of heat in the ocean backgrounds and many people would be forced to migrate to the north due to the heat stress that would begin to make it feel starting from the land under the equator.
26143	7	The scientists, therefore, are alarmed, as it will be impossible to return to the pre-industrial era. The solution would be to completely remove pollutant gases, but of course it is impossible. For this reason, at least as soon as possible, a substantial reduction of CO2 should be aimed at taking into account long-term innovative actions.
26152	1	“I’m going to get a lot of money, I’m going to get a lot of money, I’m going to get a lot of money, I’m going to get a lot of money, I’m going to get a lot of money.”
26152	3	For the immunologist and CTS member, the obligation of vaccination against Covid “will be meaningful as long as the virus will circulate”
26152	5	In a conversation with La Stampa, the immunologist Sergio Abrignani, a member of the Cts, explains that the obligation to vaccinate against Covid19 “will be meaningful until the virus circulates, and I have the impression that it will last years. I would like to emphasize that it is not just the individual, but the whole community and the only way to get out of the pandemic. The number of ultra-quarantains, for example, is 27 million, of which almost 2 million are unvaccinated. The latter, 7%, accounts for 70% of those who are in intensive therapy. It’s not just a problem for them, but for hospitals and other sick people who don’t find a place.”
26152	7	The immunologist says that obligations, such as those for over 50 in relation to work, are useful. “I think yes, but it’s a political choice that I don’t take. From a scientific point of view, I can say that vaccination is a fundamental tool. Then I was for the obligation when it wasn’t there, let’s figure now.”
26152	9	About the vaccination or not of children, Abrignani explains that “the virus has not disappeared and the pediatric scientific societies strongly recommend it. They are the same doctors who consult when children are sick, and now instead they think they lie for a global complot. and surreal.”
26152	11	Immunologist on the fourth dose
26152	13	As for the fourth dose, Abrignani says that “a fourth dose with the same vaccine of the Wuhan seed, as experienced in Israel, the data at the moment do not support the benefit. And with so many vaccines in the past we have seen that three doses are enough, two doses at a distance of 3-4 weeks and the third after 4-12 months, guaranteeing an immune memory from 5 to 10 years.” Eventually, according to the immunologist, they could benefit from a fourth call “rare cases of immunodepressions for genetic, pharmacological or infectious reasons, or those dialized. For them, the fourth dose is expected to provide at least a short-term protection.” For the rest of the population, Abrignani believes that “the call would be a new dose after the three current, but we don’t know yet if, how and when it will be necessary.”
26152	15	Read also:—>Man killed in the street by a gunshot: carabinieri investigate
26152	17	"For the immunologist, there could be three options: ""The first, unlikely, is that the virus disappears and at that point there would be no reminders. The second, less unlikely but difficult, considered the record Infectibility of Omicron, is that a new variant forces us to update the vaccines. The third is that the current variant remains. In this latter case, you could evaluate a reference with an up-to-date vaccine to Omicron that may very effectively prevent infection as well as disease. There is then the possibility, hard for me, that the third dose will not last long and then a quarter of it will be needed with the current vaccine.”"
26152	19	Read also: Canadian-Usa bridge opened occupied by ‘Freedom Convoy’ for 6 days
26152	21	The next choices will be made by monitoring the protection against the disease on the field. If it fell down for some reason, it would be the time for a reminder. Until now, the third dose is regular, it lasts at least 5 months, although at the end it is likely to be much more. The important thing is the protection from the disease, because it is not well known how many antibodies are related to immunity. Based on the experience with other vaccines, the immunity may be “different years, but I am ready to be denied.”
26152	23	As for the side effects of the vaccine, Abrignani emphasizes that these are “irrational fears. The only fact is that in young people there can be rare, not severe myocarditis and healable in a few days with cortisone. All regulatory agencies say there is greater risk of viral myocarditis than vaccine. “On billions of people vaccinated, including hundreds of millions under the age of 30, no one has died for this reason.” Finally, regarding the new Novavax vaccine, the immunologist explains that it is “more traditional, based on re-combinant proteins” and that “can be able to convince the unmotively doubtful as some parents who fear for their children. Scientificly it will be useful to compare the duration of its protection with that of mRna vaccines, although I don’t think there will be a difference.”
26156	1	Berlusconi can pass to history by spying the way to the best, Draghi
26156	3	The opinion
26156	5	Berlusconi can pass to history by spying the way to the best, Draghi
26156	7	The Cav. You can be the real protagonist in the race. Not as a future president but as a kingmaker.
26156	9	What do you think of Berlusconi at the Quirinale? As it is not practicable, for unavailability of the interested party, what for the Financial Times would be the first best, Sergio Mattarella president until the end of the legislature, but being available the second best, Mario Draghi at the Quirinale for seven years, the answer is that it would be a wrong choice. One, not the choice: it would be wrong any other name was made. A malignant question, a clear answer: I do not think that Berlusconi cannot be the president of the Republic, rather I recognize the reasons why it might be. If, always abstractly, I would become it, I won’t return the passport to the Viminal: and you crush the evil!
26156	11	I made three electoral campaigns, one with the Progressists, two with the Olivier, I was in the Senate for three legislatures: always, Berlusconi was the opponent to be defeated. If I sometimes voted in a deformity from my group, it was because I thought that it would be better to fight it. I have always thought that visceral anti-berlusconism, “with the removal,” has brought “serious struggles to the Achei.” Many have criticized me, but I was not the only one. My appeal published by the Corriere on 4 December 1994, one of my first public exits as a new senator, denounced the “myope patto against future generations” with which the trade union had forced to strike from the Finance a, though modest, pension reform submitted by the first government of Berlusconi: in addition to the signatures of Franco Modigliani, of Sylos Labini and Mario Baldassarri, also collected that of Romano Prodi.
26156	13	Andreatta and Prodi founded the center left, with or without the trail, Berlusconi the center right. Together they gave life to the season of majority and alternance. Compared to the current political landscape, I don’t think I’m the only one to regret it, and it wasn’t that for this reason the future president should appoint them both senators alive. With Prodi (and Draghi General Director of the Treasury) Italy won the Oscars of Privatization, liberalizing and returning to the market industrial sectors for more than half a century monopolized by the state; but not even trying to privatize the Rai. Berlusconi wrapped the monopoly with his commercial television and thus became the mother of all liberalizations: it gives the Italians the freedom to choose and the entrepreneurs a formidable tool to promote the internal growth of the country. This is a small step towards the unlimited digital freedom. Instead, for anti-berlusconism, commercial television created a “intrinsically Berlusconian” world: so it brought the left on positions incompatible with the claim to interpret the modern. It was a war of power overwhelmed by a war of religion, it was our thirty-year war, as it titles the book that I wrote with Antonio Pilati.
26156	15	Berlusconi, copyright Mario Seminerio, “was not worse than so many of his moralistic ill opponents who, however, didn’t have his own intuitions, and that’s why they bite bitterly for their apparent inadequacy.” His opponents sought first to declare it incompatible by pointing on the conflict of interests; then, with a cave, to make it incompatible; finally they discussed how to declare it incompatible. A quarter of a century later can well apply to the state's highest office.
26156	17	The problem is not whether it can apply, but whether it suits him. Being in great disappointment of many of his enemies is already a success, the more they contest it, the more value increases: with all the respect for the other names that are made, his appears more and more the only candidacy that can be opposed to that of Draghi.
26156	19	Is it worth risking? Instead, do not cite his detractors, and pass to history as the one who, though having the numbers to try to win, leaves you to spy the way to what he also in his heart must recognize as the best choice for the country. It was he who sent him to govern the Bank of Italy, he who launched him to the presidency of the European Central Bank, will be able to say that it was he who opened him the way to the Colle. There were two great choices: this will be the same. Again, thank you Silvio.

26156	23	Gualtieri visits the thermovalizer of Paris
26156	25	The mayor of Rome has gone to see the plant that has since 2007 treated 510,000 tons of waste and is perfectly integrated with urban fabric. It is a model. Before he took notes on how to make a thermovalorizer had also come the first citizen of Florence Dario Nardella
26156	27	in Parliament
26156	29	It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do.
26156	31	White Flag
26156	33	May with Beppe Sala? He would not even think of Giggino.
26156	35	The similarities between the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Mayor of Milan have been underestimated. However, to look well the affinities there are and are also many. But we didn’t expect it: to reveal it we needed a head to head.
26160	1	"Russian gas in Europe, von der Leyen announces the drama: ""Be prepared for total supply cuts"""
26160	3	"It is approaching the point of no return in the international economic scenarios of the war between Russia and Ukraine. This is the last ""most"" for Italy, among the most dependent countries on the energy front from Russia. “We have to be prepared for further interruptions in gas supply, including a complete cut from Russia.” This is the dramatic announcement made today by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in her intervention in the plenary session of the European Parliament for the presentation of the Czech presidency of the EU."
26160	5	"""Today, a total of 12 Member States are directly concerned by partial or total reductions in gas supply. It is obvious that Putin continues to use energy as a weapon. This is why the Commission is working on a European emergency plan. We will present this plan and the necessary tools by the middle of July. Member States already have their national emergency plans. This is positive, but we need a joint European coordination and action. We must make sure that, in case of complete interruption, the gas flows to the point where it is most needed. We must ensure European solidarity. And we must protect the industry’s single market and supply chains,” she said."
26160	7	“We should never forget the harsh lesson we learned at the beginning of the pandemic. Egoism and protectionism only lead to disunion and fragmentation. While European unity and coordination were the key remedies to overcome this brutal pandemic. As always, we hope for the best, but we prepare for the worst. This is a hard work in front of us. But as in the last few weeks, the unit will lead to success,” he emphasized. The economic consequences of the war between Russia and Ukraine are becoming increasingly heavy. Between economic recession, inflation and pandemic will be a hard winter for the Italians.
26166	1	Attention to French lessons. You can also learn from Italy.
26166	3	It would be simplistic and even consolative to calculate the result of the French legislative elections as the rescue of populism. A formula that removes traditional parties from every guilt, as if they say: what do you want to do if people prefer “those there” that are impressive.
26166	5	It is more difficult instead to investigate the reasons why voters who less than two months ago chose President Emmanuel Macron now punish him by denying him the parliamentary majority. Not only: they throw practically away the traditional formations that had so far dominated the Fifth Republic by drawing an unprecedented picture. Probably useful to decree also for all Western democracies, including Italy. Paris, you know, has been a carrier of revolutions and changes for at least two centuries. Sign the direction of the wind.
26166	7	France cares for its welfare and has always been on the forefront in the defense of rights, whatever they were. They ruled the socialists or the bullists, the samples of dualism always invented in the Exagon between left and right, no one dreamed of questioning some social achievements. So was it from de Gaulle, at the origins of the Fifth Republic, in Chirac. It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do. The first breakthrough occurred with Nicolas Sarkozy, and it was in 2007, with the untouched ostentation of wealth by the Eliseo rental, the holidays on the yachts of the finance nababbi, the idea spread by the summit that if one was poor he should feel guilty and ask questions why the social scale is at the reach of everyone, just work more. Slogan of itself controversial and intended to become rancid after not even a year with the big economic crisis of 2008 started by the United States and that has overwhelmed Europe.
26166	9	In the first term, the president called “bling-bling” by the noise of jewelry, here comes to the Eliseo the long-term socialist François Hollande presented himself in the electoral campaign with the rebound promise of taxing 90 percent of the revenue above the million euros to point to a more equal redistribution of the revenue in a society where inequalities began to mark a too deep gap between well-established people and the rest of the citizens. Promise is notined. And indeed, during his fifth year, Hollande favoured the social-democratic turn of a party that until then had jealously preserved its original roots to the left. At the point to create a disorientation for which the programs of socialists and bullists became practically interchangeable, except for negligible shades, in the name of not only the marketism, but even the financial capitalism which seemed the only polar star of reference. And invoking the “responsibility” socialists and neogolists have tried to isolate the extreme wings both to the left and, above all, to the right. Delegating them, of course, in a completely different way, the defense of the interests of the low social classes that were increasingly expanding with the progress of the crises.
26166	11	Although I suspected to be an elite expression for his first-class curriculum and child prodige of business banks, the first Macron was chosen for the conditioned reflection of arginating Marine Le Pen’s representative xenophobic and racist extreme right. He assured the French about his economic policy by noting that, while young, he was already rich enough to be free from conditions and in ideal conditions to govern equally in favor of all. But then his first step was to withdraw the tax on the great fortune in force since the times of Mitterrand. It is almost a provocation. Since then, an ostentate look at the Republicans, the moderate right party, for the formation of its governments. And a series of economic measures that didn’t go to favour the working class (yes in France it still exists) if they tended, for example, to precarize the work (such as a reform on the Renzi model). Or theoretically shared programs on the ecological transition but imposed from the top and by unsustainable costs in a country stumbled by a disadvantage. It was rural France the first to rebel when it saw removing train stations, gendarmery casermas and small territory hospitals: the savings on public services, safety and health that went to the detriment of the needs of a state that is not just Paris although it often tends to identify it with the capital.
26166	13	Thus, after almost two decades of economic policy that has favoured sufficient classes, it is not surprising that the voters have rebelled in front of the penalizing executive’s further proposal of law, which raises the retirement age from 62 to 65 years: the most shared, if desired, but which represents the classic drop that makes the vessel crack. And they prefer to choose who instead promises to commit to preserving or even reducing the age of withdrawal from work, to increase the minimum wage, and to try to reduce the gap between wealth and poverty.
26166	15	“The French who cheat, to say it with Paul Conte, are the heirs of those who cut the head to a king and don’t disdain the revolutions. Now they sent a signal to the newly elected president, choosing Jean-Luc Mélenchon to the extreme left and Marine Le Pen to the extreme right because in the political market they did not find other parties in which to identify themselves. This is the morality that emerges from the French June. And question the political class in France as elsewhere. For at the end of the trajectory of many democracies in the West have followed the same parable so much that more times there has been wondered why there have not yet been social revolts in front of a so obvious attack on rights that they had also been achieved with great difficulty while now it seems normal that a young man works for 4 euros per hour (if he’s well).
26166	17	Attention to French lessons. It can teach something to countries like Italy, now close to the vote.
2617	1	Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega: “Russia is fighting against the Nazis in Ukraine”
2617	3	The President of Nicaragua uses very clear words to comment on what is happening in Ukraine with the special military operation launched by Russia to smilitarize and denial the regime of Kiev. Russia is fighting against the Nazis in Ukraine, which are in power after a brutal 2014 coup that reminds the attempts to reverse the people's governments in Nicaragua and Venezuela, Sandinist commander Daniel Ortega said. 
2617	5	“The war is shaking the world, and we will not guess anything. “Russia is fighting for its security against the Nazis who rule and kill in Ukraine after the 2014 coup,” he said during a celebration of the Workers’ Day in Nicaragua. 
2617	7	"In connection with the Work Day, the Sandinist commander reminded that it was Russia that for the first time in human history brought to power workers and farmers and ""in the decisive battle for humanity defeated Nazism."" "
2617	9	Speaking of Ukraine, Ortega has criticized the support of the United States and Europe to the Kiev regime, which has practiced terrorist acts since the 2014 coup with the support of the Western countries.
2617	11	“I’m of the same school – murders, sad fires. They burned the House of Trade Unions (in Odessa), where the workers opposed the Nazis, because they were opposed to the coup. It is logical that they were refugees (in the building) with their stones and stones. What did the fascists do? They burned more than 40 workers alive, killed them, and all this – with the blessing, encouragement, collusion, the resources of North American and European imperialism,” Ortega said. 
26172	1	"The physicist Prodi against gretinism: ""But what CO2, global warming obeys natural cycles"""
26172	3	Rome, 5 lug — Does global warming have anthropic origin? This millennial stamping theory based on CO2 alarm that Greta Thunberg speaks has some vague scientific foundation? The professor Franco Prodi, the brother of the most famous Roman and lighting in his field, is not so sure of it.
26172	5	Physicist and academic specialist in meteorological studies and atmospheric physics, a member of numerous national and international study committees, was the director, until 2008, of the Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences of the Cnr. For years he has claimed that “there is not possible, with the current knowledge of the climate system, to quantify how much the anthropic effect is”, and that climate changes are cyclical, they have always existed, that there is such a multitude of data to consider and that therefore it is impossible to make certain long-term forecasts.
26172	7	The Professor Prodi Against the Gretine Theories on Gobal Heating
26172	9	Instead, we all remember how the illustrious brother and former president of the Council had applauded the Swedish activist for “the sudden awakening of an attention that no other media instrument would ever awaken.” In other words, he is his brother: in the afternoon of the tragedy of the Marmolada, which corally medium and Italian political class have struck themselves to impute the global warming and the unsustainable lifestyle of the Italians, the lighthouse has reiterated to La Verità some of its positions.
26172	11	The rise of the ice has a cyclical course.
26172	13	“There are natural causes and anthropic causes of change but the statements in the ICC’s reports – the UN committee that would want to study the anthropic contribution to the climate – are not scientifically unfounded, their are only scenarios, not predictions on which the fate of mankind will be based.” No one here is denying that the planet’s temperature is rising: “We’re living in a period of global warming and therefore it’s clear that every hot period involves a phase of withdrawal of glaciers with phenomena, such as what has happened recently. A few years ago I saw the remains of the collapse of one of the famous 5 Towers near the Falzarego.” The withdrawal of the glaciers, however, is not a novelty, and “in the past the alpine glaciers have been even more withdrawn than today” due to a “cyclic event” that lasts now for 10,000 years. “The global warming we are experiencing is a natural fact and is part of natural cycles. An anthropic component in climate change exists but is not currently quantifiable with scientific seriousness.”
26172	15	But the powerful only listen to Thunberg.
26172	17	Getting doubts about the anthropic origin of global warming, Prodi points out, does not mean denying the existence of a pollution alarm “on planetary level, which must naturally be fought, even with binding international agreements: but CO2 is not a polluting gas.” In this regard the physicist had signed a petition, “along with Italian scientists, recovered by a thousand scientists around the world, warning the political authorities of the supine acceptance of the IPCC recommendations and of the consequent “combat for global warming”. But now this pseudo Verbo is so widespread that the demands of our representatives to dialogue with the political authorities are systematically ignored.” For Professor Prodi, “The listening granted to Thunberg and denied to our petition tells it long about the discretion of which science enjoys in our country. I think sadly — closing the scientist — that the point of non-return has been reached.”
26176	1	“Don’t walk alone”: the French surreal vademecum against immigrant aggression
26176	3	Rome, 9 lug — While the new statistics on crime are published and Lyon is ranked first, becoming the most dangerous city in France (63 murders in 2021 against the 61 in Marseille and, as a comparison term, 26 in Naples, against the 18 in Rome and 19 in Turin), some groups of citizens decide to create a vademecum for use primarily of women — but not only.
26176	5	Nantes, the vademecum to not end rape by immigrants
26176	7	First case in Nantes, the volantine was proposed with the ameno title The Good Behavior to get out to Nantes safely. As to say, “Don’t go to look for it”; a phrase that the feminists have always – in the right title – hated, but that now becomes an obligation just like the unknown: that is, the pleonastic equation immigration-criminality.
26176	9	But here is the happy formula to get out safely in a very normal European city:
26176	11	Avoid pulling out the phone.
26176	13	Choose a jacket with internal pockets and preferably with zip closure
26176	15	Be careful with your glass to avoid being drugged by malicious people.
26176	17	Stay on main roads and don’t walk on small roads.
26176	19	Do not respond to offenses and insults or catcalling
26176	21	Choose small bags that can be closed.
26176	23	Do not carry open pockets.
26176	25	Do not go home alone.
26176	27	Do not take a taxi or Uber alone.
26176	29	Do not pull out the package of cigarettes, do not smoke on the road.
26176	31	Do not stop in isolated places to look for something in your pocket or respond to a message.
26176	33	Don’t let your friends go home alone.
26176	35	Do not carry your phone in the back pocket of jeans or pants.
26176	37	In the bus, stay close to the driver.
26176	39	There is only a lack: don’t put the minigonna or a dress too short and make up with moderation, and then in the vademecum there’s more or less everything. Therefore, the morality is, instead of fighting crime, making our cities safe, limiting — or at least controlling — the phenomenon of extra-European immigration so that a Western woman is free to leave as, where and when she wants, it is the woman herself to be cautious through “virtual” behaviors.
26176	41	The “Christian Bee” to defend itself from Muslims
26176	43	The situation is so serious in France — and it will soon be for us — that even one of the latest trends on TikTok is the use of the veil even for non-Muslims: “the Christian veil and how to put it in a stylish way.” Now, because if you’re covered, you’re probably a girl for good and less exposed to unwanted attention (and for unwanted attention we refer to rape and aggression). In fact, a kind of Islamization, a real transposition of Michel Houellebecq’s visionary novel, Sottomission, which talks about a France now conquered by Islam.
26177	1	This is the “sweet” plan of the government: light cuts and gas. And a beautiful fire. Tell us now that the penalties work.
26177	3	Rome, 11 lug – Cuts to light and gas, the government’s sweet plan is ready, but the story will not change, they will continue to tell us that sanctions against Russia work. They will repeat it at papagall in the medium, as sad ventriloques of the single word, with the spock of strangers who know it. It is the most fearful one who will recour to the answers from Sapientino, because in the end for those who live in pancioles we are faced with a game for boys, not a dramatic reality. And then they will tell us that the situation is all under control and that we should do some little sacrifice to prevent Putin from winning the war. Small sacrifices can be translated into: less heating, less light, less consumption. In the extreme summary: more cold and dark, for a brivid winter.
26177	5	Light and gas cuts, like sugared caramels
26177	7	It seems like a profetical preaching by the birds of the malaugurio, not that the government of Draghi is really oriented to implement this miraculous “emergency plan”. They call it already so, pirandellianly appears more sweet than a caramel, pills love to taste like sugared shakes. The whole will then be well-dose, by step, a small sacrifice at a time. And only if Russia had to cut our gas completely. At the moment, it has cut “only” a third.
26177	9	The executive of the best is approaching the plan calmly, has planned exactly everything, including the “consciousness campaign”. They call it so, this is also a evergreen to sweep the martelling propaganda aimed at persuading us of the goodness of the drastic intervention. It is not to say, but to say, that will be the Italian people.
26177	11	The government's plan to leave it cold and dark
26177	13	In the “house plan” it is assumed to lower the temperature of heating and air conditioners by two degrees. It is then expected to reduce the lighting time and also a nice firewall (ah, old firewall) in this case not to avoid Covid infections. This is (maybe) water passed, we are faced with a quality jump (feil correction: quantity jump) of restrictions: the cover the evening will be for lighting. From the micro to the macro, from the “plan house” to the “plan city”: reduction in public lighting up to 40%. In summary: lighting of a lamp on two at night. It is the most important thing that you can do when you’re going to get a lot of money and you’re going to get a lot of money.
26177	15	And again, a chicco at the time, caramel after caramel, will also touch to reduce productive consumption. Selectively, if clear, only the so-called “gas interruptible” and the “electric interruptible” will be initially involved. Do you look like terminological supercats for annoying scenarios? But no, sanctions against Russia work, it’s just a matter of small sacrifices. and great bridges.
26178	1	Emergencies and the stupidity of politics
26178	3	The Covid has been running again and, unfortunately, restrictive interventions and new measures to be carried out in the autumn, with the return of the famous mascherina and the advent of a fourth dose of vaccination.
26178	5	The health emergency comes with new threats every day: the monkeys is only the last of a worrying series of situations careful by the WHO. The pandemic is in good company. The war that climbs the doors of the West is affirmed to be evil, dirty, evil and intended to protrude in time, sowing death, fear and uncertainty spread. Economic, energy, food, and humanitarian crises in the wider and complex sense of the term.
26178	7	All this is associated with the alarm, once fully shared, due to the water shortage, the blue gold of the new millennium. Mass migration, from the south and the east, will not save any country. It will have to be properly prepared, since the reception cannot or should not, regardless of the organization, the competence and a shared design. The policy, in turn, sleeps, proceeds, contradicts, showing a fragility that leaves basic, simply out-of-the-counter.
26178	9	Weak, fragile, in perpetual balance between the nothing and the relative, protected to the sweet doing nothing, blind and blind to the needs of the peoples. The whole policy, not interested in indicating lengths or geographical latitudes, is strongly praised to beat a blow, to give signs of life, not to wait for the catastrophe before intervening, placing, as usual, a curtain at the bell and better, trying to stop bleeding and incurable cancers, made them by the incompetence, and by the wrath, of its non-protagonist actors.
26178	11	While global globalism highlights structural cramps, gently discuss cannabis plants, civilian capricks, democratic heroisms against imaginary enemies, intolerance is fought with the “nobility” tools of defamation, free offensive, infamous labelling, scattered foam to cover their shortcomings. They need culture, love for service, humility, attachment to values, longevity and courage.
26178	13	Politics must again express excellence, valuing militance and merit, refusing other logic. The management of public affairs is an honor and a responsibility, not merely a profession aimed at personal enrichment or the appropriation of square meters of power.
26178	15	I can conclude with the following claims of Carlo Maria Martini, monitored by the men of every era: “The level of alarm reaches when the ethical expiration of politics is no longer perceived as harmful.”
2618	1	UkrLeaks: Nazi exports from the United States to Kiev 
2618	3	It seems that the US does not only export weapons to Ukraine in the prosecutor's war against Russia. In Kiev they are also sent directly to the U.S. neonazist battlefield happy to reach a country like Ukraine now becoming a reference point for the extreme right worldwide. 
2618	5	This is the result of an investigation published on UKR Leaks, a portal that leads Vasily Prozorov, the former secret agent of the Ukrainian SBU until 2018. So a well-informed person and with direct contacts on the field. 
2618	7	Again we see confirmed the need to denial the Ukrainian regime, one of the reasons that pushed Russia to launch its special military operation last February, but that in the West is defined as a remarkable, pretestous and propagandistic motivation. In fact, in the same West it has come to deny the neonazism of various formations such as the Azov Battle. 
2618	9	Prozorov writes on UKR Leaks: “Washington has fed the Nazi movements in Ukraine for many years and regularly supplies our national-socialists to create a “new Reich” in the center of Europe.” 
2618	11	“It may be difficult to believe immediately, but in the country of BLM and aggressive tolerance, the Nazis feel quite comfortable. For example, organizations such as The American Front and The National Socialist Movement (NSM), also known as the Nazi Party of America (Nazi American Party), have been operating in the United States for more than a decade.
2618	13	American Nazis don’t especially hide their opinions and activities, they actively share photos, videos and “educational” literature and also collect donations from people who think the same way.
2618	15	At first glance, we can define the NSM as a marginally marginal grouping (...) However, the party has its channel on Telegram, which involuntaryly suggests the interest of American nationalists for the “slave” audience. This is where the fun begins. The channel itself is not of particular interest, but it has a private chat in which radicals from all over the world, including Ukraine, participate actively.”
2618	17	"Indeed, here comes a very interesting part that includes the recruitment of volunteers for Ukraine: “You can notice that there are many Ukrainian citizens in the chat lists. Moreover, many participants, including the US, openly report their participation in hostilities by the Ukrainian nationalists. I have to emphasize that they are the nationalists, not the APU (Kiev Armed Forces)! In particular, we talk about ""Azov"" and ""Destro Sector"". The chat also supports the Battaglione recruitment campaign.”"
2618	19	"We read then in the investigation: “It is quite obvious that among the radicals the Kiev government does not enjoy neither respect nor support. V. Zelensky is accused of anti-Semitism. On the contrary, the Nazis see in Ukraine the real ""new Reich"", whose core should be ""Azov"". The “Fuhrer” seems to be A. Biletsky. This idea is expressed by some of the most active chat participants.”"
26181	1	The Dilemma of Super Mario
26181	3	When the hour of the irresponsible climbs, the perceptions change: the emergency becomes ordinary administration, the dramaticity is stumbled in the foolish days of recreation. It seems a century has passed from the night press conferences of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in full pandemic, which enlightened with verbal monologues the anguish of the Italians locked in the house. But now it is the same leader Five Stars playing a desperate personal match, voted for the removal of the context that brought to the government of Draghi.
26181	5	The President of the Council is a flameful witness to the countercourse of the Five Stars, the weak and unreliable ring of an increasingly less blinded and increasingly unexpected majority. Draghi doesn’t like apodetic phrases or media shoots, in fact he meditates and remughs. The former president of the ECB, the technocrate called by the most responsible parties to commission a weak policy, appears alibied in front of the dilemma that indirectly puts him the scattered grilled brigade. It will be the first time that we will be able to do this, and the first time we will be able to do this, the first time we will be able to do this, the second time we will be able to do this, the second time we will be able to do this.
26181	7	In twelve months the internal and international framework remains explosive, at the moment no one can formulate one out of the red zone between war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, the cost of life that erodes incomes and increasingly weak profits, the coat of a pandemic that has immersed us in the darkness of a systematic infection. Italy is traveling, like many countries, a dark tunnel from which you can’t get out. Only the Five Stars, who plung out of withdrawal and government losses, have decided by crying political calculation to disconnect the fundamental reasons for an emergency government based on national unity. They are the ones who have opened a crack, not so numerous given the continuous decline of parliamentary weight, but in terms of rediscussion of a more patriotical than political alliance. At the time there is greater need for national cohesion, Conte and his Japanese in the jungle reason in terms of small tactics. Russia cuts our gas and they’re cursing the dissolution of Di Maio, Putin threatens an apocalyptic scenario and they’re playing to strike the President of the Council on electoral clients such as citizenship income. If they leave the government, there will be a way to repair the damages infected by the assistencialist policies imposed by the decadent visions of Beppe Grillo. And if they return to vote before the planned, the Italians will have the opportunity to archive the real populism of the improvised to power, those who don’t know how to distinguish a war from a corridory beag.
26185	1	Lukashenko to “international scammers” of the pandemic: “It’s enough!”
26185	3	Lukashenko to the “international scammers” of the pandemic: “It’s enough!”
26185	5	In a press conference yesterday, the President of Belarus defeated the entire pandemic narration, brought forward by globalists to destroy the middle class.
26185	7	“I want to say to all these international scammers, that’s enough. Our pockets have been so shrinking that there is nothing more. They washed them all. This pandemic is to be ended. It’s enough, they’ve already taken the people around,” the question puts without means Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, who since the early months of 2020 has made his country a balloon against the health dictatorships. Unlike the rest of Europe, in fact, the ‘White Russia’ faced Covid only on the health plan, without ever imposing restrictions on civil and individual freedoms, and the prime minister ended in the middle of the media service when in the summer of 2020 openly accused the WHO of offering it 940 million euros to impose in its country the same liberticid measures imposed in Italy. With Putin on his back, Lukashenko has never flattered himself in front of globalist interests, always disguising the political game of economic and political destruction of the western world that cells behind the “pandemic.”
26185	9	He said what now everyone knows, except the Italian media, with Omicron the Covid is now a little more than an influenza, urging its citizens not to be afraid: “One of them, an American or Western expert, said: ‘If Omicron is a so easy virus, let us all get sick and it will be a vaccine for us. From my point of view, a perfect suggestion.”
2619	1	Covid, while Europe turns the 'Japanese' Hope remains in the pandemic jungle
2619	3	“It’s time to open Sweden again,” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a press conference.
2619	5	Sweden has decided to eliminate the restrictions for the pandemic next week, while the country, while still marked sufficiently sustained levels of infection, relies on increasing immunity due to vaccine references, immunity acquired by healers and managed hospitalization levels to keep Covid alive, Reuters reports. 
2619	7	Sweden had extended its current pandemic measures, which include premature closure for bars and restaurants and a limit of 500 people for closed events, for another two weeks by the end of January. In general, however, in that of Stockholm they faced the pandemic without hysteries and relying on the good sense. 
2619	9	The decision of the Swedish government is in line with what other European governments have decided to deal with Covid as an influenza, saying we are at the end of the pandemic phase with the endemization of the virus. 
2619	11	From 9 February, practically all the restrictions of the past will be abolished, as has already happened in Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Finland. No vaccine certificate will be mandatory anywhere. 
2619	13	It remains barricated in the pandemic jungle, as the Japanese soldiers after World War II, the Italian Minister of Health Roberto Speranza. In Rome, there is still discussion of green pass extension, red zones and limitations for non-vaccinated people. 
2619	15	As a rule on every question be at the center of the political debate – because the pandemic is also a political and non-health issue – the Italian rulers look toward Europe, will it be different for the pandemic and the infinite restrictions that have marked the last two years?
26191	1	It was not the Çovid to make people die but they were the lockdown.
26191	3	14/06/2022 - It was not the Covid to make people die but it was the lockdown. The influenza virus called COVID has not caused a higher number of victims than the common seasonal influenza. They were the confinements forced to cause the anomaly of deaths. Now they are the same scientists. Having closed people at home, having suspended the care with the “vigil waiting and tachipirine” killed people. In the end, a large portion of the population has understood it and now there is no city, place, where the Minister of Health Hope is going to be called “ASSASSIN”. It happened in Palermo, Messina, Bologna, Forenze, etc.
26191	5	The global state blow through the “pandemia” failed thanks to men like Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Víctor Orban and Aleksandr Lukashenko who was the first to denounce the attempt of corruption by the elite of Davos. At the end of this story, the responsible will be handed over to justice.
26196	1	We are playing the French.
26196	3	It is a political game, rather fanatical. Let us guess that we are French, or that the French are us, with all their institutional and electoral system. Imagine then that Emmanuel Macron is Enrico Letta, that Marine Le Pen is Giorgia Meloni, Jean Luc Mélenchon is Giuseppe Conte, Eric Zemmour is Matteo Salvini, and go down all the others, with the goalist Valerie Pecresse in the pannies of Silvio Berlusconi and the socialist Anne Hidalgo in those of the leftest, i.e. Pier Luigi Bersani, Roberto Speranza, Nicola Fratoianni. In addition, but very lateral, the other defeated French candidates that in Italy could be incarnated by Matteo Renzi, Carlo Calenda and centrists of various order and degree. Of course we have to play as if we were in a semi-presidential system, precisely the French, in which the president of the Republic is elected by the people and essentially is the head of the government, with a double round electoral law that provides for voting among the first two arrived. The rest must be satisfied with a small triumph right and voting refunds, if they exceeded 5 percent of the votes.
26196	5	According to the polls available to us, Letta and Meloni would go to the ballot, a dry challenge between right and left that reminds those between Prodi and Berlusconi of 1996 and 2006. In this case, however, there would not be coalitions of five, six, seven or even nine parties to support the two candidates, with consequent and legitimate claims of ministers and sub-secretariates, crossed reckets and small cabotage toys, but at the maximum voting statements for one or the other. Just as it is happening in France these days. Then, after the result, he will touch who will have won to open or not his government to some representatives of the minor forces who have invited their voters to vote for him or her. In any case, the winner will have a lot of power, enough to allow him to rule throughout the legislature.
26196	7	Then let’s see how you could play the game all athletes in the field. The two protagonists will try to get the available votes on the square, Letta will have the hardest task having to turn to both the left and the center, that is, it will have to try to propose a program that can convince Conte, Bersani, Fratoianni, Renzi and Calenda, and it will not be enough for him to appeal to a kind of popular face against the right: it will instead have to try to explain to the voters what he intends to do on all matters on the agenda of a country that will not be out of the economic crisis, caused by the pandemic and then by the war in Ukraine. In poor words, it will have to be exposed to the taxes, i.e. those who have to pay more and those who have to pay less, the recipients of the few available resources, the civil rights, the immigrants and so on. It will not be easy for him to convince the leaders and voters to vote so different and very thick in contrast with each other, especially the grillins and the left-wing radicals who don’t like (euphemism) the Renzians and the Calendians. And vice versa.
26196	9	For Meloni the game seems simpler, in the background the values (call us so) of the Italian right are very similar if not equal. What would be the difference between Fratelli d’Italia and the League? It is very little, so it is very likely that the voters of Salvini would vote convinced and in mass for Giorgia Meloni. The discourse for those who still identify themselves in Forza Italia is legally different: as far as the “fear” of the left, the Communists would say the Knight, someone would not feel comfortable with a sovereign and substantially anti-European president, for more scattered by Salvini.  It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do. While among the Cinquentes, where we find people coming from the left along with others who have a history and a culture that with the left has nothing to do, someone who can give his vote to Meloni might be there. I think it’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do.
26196	11	And then existed the French system that would allow us to have a President elected directly by the people, who could rule in holy peace for five years, without obstacles, rejects and veto rights of the parties? Or is it better to have our system, in which the people vote the parties that then represent him in Parliament, who in turn elect the Prime Minister, who must respond to Parliament, as will Parliament, i.e. the parties that make it, that in the subsequent elections will have to inform the people of what has been or has not been done?  From the point of view of functionality, governability, efficiency and speed of decision making, it is obvious that the first assumption would be better. But rather than democracy, pluralism and representation, the second would be better. If Giorgia Meloni was elected directly by the citizens, then we should keep her in the Chigi Palace, rather in the Quirinale, for five years. If he would become prime minister by the will of the majority of parliamentarians, this will could also change from day to day. It is better not to risk.
26199	1	Scholz: The EU is the antiquity of imperialism and autocracy
26199	3	"The European Union can no longer allow its nationalities in foreign policy: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz writes this in an article on the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dedicated to the consequences for Germany and for Europe of the Russian war in Ukraine. “The imperialism has returned to Europe. Many hoped that close economic ties and mutual dependence would ensure stability and security at the same time. Putin has now visibly destroyed this hope with his war against Ukraine. ""Russian missiles have not only caused mass destruction in Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kherson, but have also reduced the European and international peace order in recent decades,"" he wrote."
26199	5	Scholz emphasizes the need for a “geopolitical European Union”: for the German Chancellor, the Member States must stretch the lines in all the policies on which so far there has been disagreement, such as the migration policy, the common defence, the technological sovereignty. The federal government, Scholz writes, will make proposals about it in the coming months. The German Chancellor then emphasizes that the “egoistic blocks of European decisions by individual Member States” must be ended.
26205	1	Russia is preparing for an offensive on the internal front.
26205	3	24 May 2022 Russia is preparing for an offensive on the internal front
26205	5	Under conditions where it is impossible to break Russia with external aggression, Western politicians are preparing for internal destabilization of Russia.
26205	7	During his speech at the 30th Assembly of the Council for Foreign and Defence Policy, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, describing the current situation, explained that “collective West” has declared a total hybrid war against us. The French Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, announced a complete economic and financial war against Russia in March this year.
26205	9	The struggle against the dangers from the outside is evident to everyone and there is greater availability to this, at the same time the struggle on the internal front has always been the hardest, and it is precisely this internal front the confrontation ground on which the countries of the West are now trying to organize against Russia.
26205	11	During his visit to Europe, after Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine, on March 26 U.S. President Joe Biden said that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power. Shortly later, a White House spokesman clarified that Biden did not demand a power change in Russia: “President believes that Putin should not be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors.”
26205	13	However, it must be understood that such a statement by Biden is not at all an improvisation of an elderly person who foolishes the audience with his speeches. Speaking in Warsaw, they read a text prepared by a teleprompter, only one of the authors of this speech was too frank. The official authorities in the West are not ready to enter into direct conflict with Russia, as this is worn from the danger of a Third World War and therefore publicly deny their intentions to change power in Russia.
26205	15	“The change of regime in Russia is not the goal of the NATO,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. “We are not looking for a regime change in Moscow. But I would like to be clear: a weakened Russia is a consequence of Putin’s decision to launch an unjustified invasion, Britain’s foreign ministry chief Liz Truss said.
26205	17	All these statements are not credible. On December 7, 2021, during his testimony to the U.S. Senate, Deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland explained that it was planned to isolate Russia from the global financial system, with all the consequences that would be derived from it for Russian affairs and its population. At the same time, Reuters, citing an anonymous White House official, that the sanctions in processing would have a serious impact on consumers, production activities and Russian employment.
26205	19	It is also worth paying attention to the publication in the American magazine The Atlantic, written by a former counselor of the U.S. State Department. Earlier, in March 2021, before the beginning of all the aggravations in Ukraine, I attracted the attention of readers on one of the articles of former American diplomats, in which they shared their plans for Ukraine, and concluded that the United States would have tried to revenge there and take this country under their control.
26205	21	This time, the former U.S. official quoted by The Atlantic is saying without means that the U.S. should report to the Russian elite that the country has no future under the presidency of Vladimir Putin. Russia under Vladimir Putin is a profoundly dangerous state, the article says.
26205	23	It is in the interest of the West to keep Russia weak, internally divided and militarily impotent. In such conditions, although the “liberalizing revolution” may come, there is no reason to act as if it had already come or was inevitable, the author believes.
26205	25	Therefore, even when the conflict between Russia and Ukraine will be resolved and official sanctions will be revoked, it makes sense with all possible means to disconnect Western companies from doing business there to raise public dissatisfaction.
26205	27	Therefore, the United States has not hidden itself and does not hide that their goal is to press the common Russians to change the policy of Russian leadership and, possibly, the entire leadership. Now U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, explaining the need to allocate $40 billion to Ukraine, says there is a chance to defeat Russia. Otherwise, its actions will change the face of Europe and send the “fake signals” to China. It does not hesitate to say that one of the objectives of the United States is a change of power in Russia.
26205	29	Lindsey Graham, a 66-year-old neocon, a representative of the “deep state” of the United States, who kept the russofobic sound during Donald Trump’s presidency, previously said that Vladimir Putin should be removed from power. Of course, not only in the US Congress, the House of Representatives also approved the bill on the allocation of $40 billion to Ukraine with an enormous majority of 388 votes for and 57 against.
26205	31	U.S. foreign policy veteran Henry Kissinger told the Financial Times in an interview that the United States is forced to engage in a regime change in authoritarian countries as authoritarian regimes multiply new types of increasingly destructive and sophisticated weapons that could threaten the United States. Of course, all this has been said with reference to the comparison between the US and Russia in Ukraine.
26205	33	However, the kingdom of the neocons and this approach to foreign policy in the United States is coming to the end. Senator Rand Paul, introducing his amendment to the draft law, temporarily blocked $40 billion allocation to Kiev. Explaining his actions, he said he did not want success for Ukraine at the expense of the US failure.
26205	35	Other Republicans also openly expressed themselves against the rescue for Ukraine because spending dollars in another country means that the federal government cannot control the Mexican border and young parents cannot find artificial milk for their children.
26205	37	Donald Trump Jr. and the new Republican candidates are strongly opposed to helping Ukraine, explaining that money will go to war and corrupt officials in the same United States. The candidate for the Ohio Senate J.D. Vance, who won the Republican Party primaries, was the only contestant who opposed U.S. intervention in the situation in Ukraine.
26205	39	The New York Times, which has always joined the U.S. Democratic Party’s point of view on the issue of providing 40 billion aid to Ukraine, also suffers of the ease with which the U.S. legislators of both sides give the money of taxpayers to another country, although more recently they have fought to finance their citizens, trying to balance the costs.
26205	41	All this suggests that the current power elites in the United States don’t have much time, as the U.S. problems require urgent solutions. Therefore, they are starting to turn the situation to destabilize Russia at this time. So, for example, the US CIA has distributed instructions in Russian explaining how to get in touch with them on the Internet.
26205	43	The CIA asks the people using the instructions to provide their full name, their official position and what access they have to the information of interest to the U.S. intelligence. According to the Washington Post, the instruction was published in connection with the American intelligence desire to establish a contact with the Russians, “occupied” by a special military operation in Ukraine. Therefore, the US side intends to intensify the recruitment of Russians.
26205	45	Russian Foreign Intelligence Director Sergei Naryshkin said the U.S. Department has commissioned controlled non-governmental organizations to launch a campaign to scredit the military operation in Ukraine into the Russian society. The general message circulating on social media is that Ukraine, supported by the West, is about to inflict a shocking defeat on Russia and “only a large-scale civil protest is presumably able to save the country from an imminent disaster.”
26205	47	For his part, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov described the cynicism of the situation: “The horror is that politicians (of the United States), who previously respected enough, whose knowledge I appreciated very much, publish appeals on the American Media to Russian diplomats and military to pass from the so-called democracy side. In fact, my comrades are pushed to betrayal, which in any country is considered a disgusting act,” he told Solovyov Live.
26205	49	“My comrades, the staff of the embassy, are receiving threats, including physical violence. And figures from the U.S. intelligence services flirt around the Russian embassy, distributing telephones from the FBI and the CIA, offering to call to establish “cooperation” contacts. “The targeted messages are sent to mobile numbers, ads with special service addresses and invitations to respond to these calls,” Antonov said.
26205	51	Therefore, it is not surprising that the American “Radio Liberty”, included by the Russian Ministry of Justice in the list of media acting as foreign agents, introduces the idea that “the Russian elites understand that the war is lost.” However, the German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) has now “trapped out of the naftalene” Mikhail Kasyanov, a former Russian statisticist who now has left Russia and is hiding in Europe.
26205	53	In the interview above, it was the DW journalist giving the tone with a prejudice towards a power change in Russia. Kasyanov himself expressed the hope that Western sanctions will hit the Russian media class with a constant access to the Internet and, through this communication channel, Kasyanov’s supporters will be able to influence the situation in Russia to change the current government.
26205	55	Therefore, it is obvious that the current level of Western agitation that demands a change of power in Russia has already exceeded the level of the Soviet era. The unmasked agitation is carried out not only in relation to the common Russians, but also in relation to diplomats and public officials.
26205	57	Russia is now in a situation where external pressure cannot break it and only an internal explosion can divide the country. The Russian people must only show patience and wait for the storm to break the world order, because Russia has all the resources needed to do so. Then the people will not have to rebuild the country from the scales, as it has already happened in our history, but it will be possible to build a new world order based on the interests of Russia.
26210	1	Moscow and Beijing: U.S. plans to transform insects into biological weapons
26210	3	Riad primary recipient of funds for the Chinese Seat Road in the first half of 2022
26210	5	The Russian Special Operation in Ukraine has discovered the pandora vessel of U.S. biolaborators in the former Soviet Republic, but they are only a few of the dozens of such laboratories that the U.S. manages worldwide. During the special operation, the Russians got in possession of scotching documents that blast Washington in front of their responsibilities, despite the Western press continuing to ignore the matter.
26210	7	Igor Kirillov, head of the radioactive, chemical and biological protection force of the Russian Federation, recently revealed new information that seriously question the safety standards of Ukrainian biolaborators. According to the documents in possession of the Russians, the U.S. had allocated approximately $15 million to raise the security level of the Merefa laboratory, the city of Charkiv, but Ukrainian officials replied that the modernization of the security system would be impossible until the structure was commissioned in violation of the security rules and requirements. This also means that no one knows where the $15 million paid by the U.S. authorities ended.
26210	9	Kirillov also revealed that the research in Ukraine was supported not only by the United States, but also by Poland and Germany. However, none of the countries involved had the right to notify the United Nations of the existence of this joint project. Kirillov recalled that every signer of the Convention on Biological and Toxic Weapons is obliged to submit an annual report to prove the compliance of their research with the terms of the international agreement, however in the statements submitted by Ukraine, the United States, Poland and Germany there is no trace of the research carried out in Ukrainian biolaborators.
26210	11	General Lieutenant Kirillov stressed that Ukraine stated in the 2016-2020 reports that its government had not conducted and was not conducting any offensive or defensive activities within the framework of the biological research and development programs, according to the TASS news agency. “This is contrary to the statement made by Lewis Gitter, Vice Political Adviser of the US Mission at the OSCE, on 20 May 2022,” the Russian official explained. At that occasion, Gitter said they had been sent aid to Kiev “to reduce biological threats and to support public and veterinary health to reduce the risk of illnesses” and “to secure illegal biological weapons left in the former Soviet states after the fall of the USSR”.
26210	13	The question is: why was the work within the framework of the joint military biological projects named in the UP code not mentioned in the reports submitted by the United States and Ukraine to the UN? This secret is a reason to wonder about the Pentagon’s true goals in Ukraine,” Kirillov said. As we had been able to emphasize in previous articles, Kirillov noted the existence of reports from Ukrainian intelligence services about the activity of U.S. biolaborators in Ukraine, which were considered a threat by the same Kiev intelligence.
26210	15	In the same days, an article by Shan Jie and Fan Wei published in the Chinese newspaper Global Times raised the question of the U.S. program known as “Insect Allies”, which could transform insects into lethal biological weapons. The Pentagon project provides for the transmission of genetically modified viruses to plants by altering the genes of crops. Officially, the project would serve to avoid hunger, allowing agriculture in unfavourable climates and defending plants from diseases, but in reality this project can be used as a weapon, obtaining exactly the opposite effect, i.e. to destroy the enemy’s food waste, or to spread mortal diseases among the population.
26210	17	Why do we use insects as a carrier? Why do the U.S. build bio-laboratories near other countries like Russia? When Pandora’s vessel will be opened, a series of disasters will follow,” an expert interviewed by the Global Times said.
26210	19	However, this project represents only the peak of the iceberg of the many secret operations carried out by the United States throughout the planet. In addition to the Insect Allies program, the U.S. has conducted biological experiments worldwide in their biolaboratories, violating all international conventions on this, as well as the rules of safety and ethics.
26210	21	The Insect Allies project was launched in 2017 by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a U.S. Department of Defense research and development agency responsible for the development of high-tech military applications. In April 2018, a Science article warned that the U.S. defense project could have transformed insects into biological weapons. “If it succeeded, the technique could be used by malicious actors to help spread diseases to almost all species of crops and devastate harvests,” the American Association for the Advancement of Science said in a statement that “the research could be considered a violation of the Convention on Organic Weapons.”
26210	23	Similar comments were provided by the German Max Planck Institute, according to which the insects of the project “may be easily misused in an improper way for the development of biological weapons,” and by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC), an international organization that deals with environmental toxicology and environmental chemistry. According to the SETAC, “the combination of a genetic modification induced by viruses of plants grown on the field using genetically modified insects carriers poses a greater risk than the existing use of genetically modified organisms.” Due to the extensive prohibition of the Convention on biological weapons, any biological research of interest must be plausibly justified as functional for peaceful purposes. The Insect Allies program could violate the Convention on biological weapons if the reasons presented by the DARPA are not plausible,” the institution said.
26210	25	“It would be deadly to turn a insect into a biological weapon, because so far the viruses in crops have been very difficult to control. Once an infected plant develops symptoms, it is almost impossible to save it. And the virus continues to vary, creating even more difficulties in prevention,” says Zhang Jie, an expert at the Institute for Plant Protection at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
26210	27	The Insect Allies program, as we said earlier, is just one of many cases in which U.S. research has been accused of causing terrible consequences around the world, especially through the use of biological laboratories. The United States has openly admitted to managing 336 biological laboratories in 30 countries worldwide, of which 26 in Ukraine. However, there are sufficient documents to confirm that the United States has signed contracts with at least 49 countries.
26210	29	One of these countries, in addition to the already mentioned Ukraine, is the other former Soviet Republic of Georgia. In 2014, the Lugar Center built in the U.S. near Tbilisi was equipped with a insect facility and launched a project called “Raising Awareness about Barcoding of Sand Flies in Georgia and Caucasus”. A few months later, Tbilisi was infected with puzzling mosquitoes that developed an atypical behavior compared to what they had shown before, including an extraordinary longevity and cold resistance. Furious mosques have also been found in the nearby Russian region of Daghestan.
26210	31	All of this must raise a series of questions about what are the real intentions of the United States about the numerous investigations they conduct illegally around the world, without adequately informing the international bodies appointed.
26219	1	President Draghi's Communications to the Senate
26219	3	The President,
26219	5	Honorable Senators and Senators,
26219	7	Last Thursday I resigned my resignation in the hands of the President of the Republic.
26219	9	This decision is followed by coming less of the majority of national units that has supported this Government since its birth.
26219	11	The President of the Republic rejected my resignation and asked me to inform the Parliament of what happened – a decision I shared.
26219	13	The Communications of today allow me to explain to you and all the Italians the reasons for a choice as suffering as due.
26219	15	Last February, the President of the Republic assigned me the task of forming a government to address the three emergencies that Italy had faced: pandemic, economic, and social.
26219	17	“A government” – these were his words – “of high profile, which should not be identified with any political formula.”
26219	19	“A government that faces serious, unreturn emergencies in a timely manner.”
26219	21	All major parties – with only one exception – decided to respond positively to that appeal.
26219	23	In the settlement speech you hold in this hall, let’s expressly refer to the “Republican Spirit” of the Government, which would rise on the presumption of national unity.
26219	25	In these months, national unity has been the best guarantee of this executive’s democratic legitimacy and its effectiveness.
26219	27	I believe that a Council President who has never presented himself before the voters should have the broadest possible support in Parliament.
26219	29	This prerequisite is even more important in an emergency context, where the Government must make decisions that deeply affect the lives of the Italians.
26219	31	The extensive consensus that the Government in Parliament allowed to have that “tempestivity” in the decisions that the President of the Republic had requested.
26219	33	For a long time, the forces of the majority have been able to put off the divisions and converge with state sense and generosity towards rapid and effective interventions, for the benefit of all citizens.
26219	35	Thanks to the health retention measures, the vaccination campaign, the economic support measures for families and, we have managed to overcome the most acute phase of the pandemic, to boost economic recovery.
26219	37	The incentive to investments and the protection of household revenues have allowed us to get out faster than other countries from the recession caused by the pandemic.
26219	39	Last year the economy grew by 6.6% and the ratio between public debt and GDP fell by 4.5 percentage points.
26219	41	The drawing up of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, approved by this Parliament with a vast majority, has launched a path of reforms and investments that has no precedent in recent history.
26219	43	The reforms of justice, competition, tax, contracts – in addition to the body agenda of simplifications – are an essential step forward to modernizing Italy.
26219	45	To date, all the objectives of the first two semesters of the PNRR have been achieved.
26219	47	We have already received €45.9 billion from the European Commission, which will be added to another €21 billion in the coming weeks – a total of €67 billion.
26219	49	With the strong parliamentary support of the majority and the opposition, we reacted with absolute firmness to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
26219	51	The condemnation of Russian atrocities and full support for Ukraine have shown how Italy can and should have a leading role within the European Union and the G7.
26219	53	At the same time, we have never stopped our pursuit of peace – a peace that must be acceptable for Ukraine, sustainable, durable.
26219	55	We were among the first to commit to Russia and Ukraine to work together to avoid a food disaster, and at the same time to open a negotiating spiral.
26219	57	The progress that took place last week in Turkey is encouraging, and we expect it to be consolidated.
26219	59	We moved very quickly to overcome the unacceptable energy dependence on Russia – a consequence of decades of myopic and dangerous choices.
26219	61	In a few months, we have reduced our Russian gas imports from 40% to less than 25% of the total and we intend to shrink them within a year and a half.
26219	63	It is a result that seemed unthinkable, which gives peace for the future to the industry and families, strengthens our national security, our credibility in the world.
26219	65	We have accelerated, with deep simplifications and massive investments, on the front of renewable energies, to defend the environment, to increase our energy independence.
26219	67	And we have been committed to protecting citizens and from the consequences of the energy crisis, with particular attention to the weakest.
26219	69	We allocated 33 billion in a little more than a year, almost two percentage points of GDP, despite our public finance margins were limited.
26219	71	We were able to do so thanks to a recovered collective credibility, which included the increase in debt costs even in a stage of rise in interest rates.
26219	73	The merit of these results was yours – of your willingness to put the differences and work for the good of the country, with equal dignity, in mutual respect.
26219	75	Their was the best response to the last February call of the President of the Republic and to the demands of seriousness, the need for protection, the concerns about the future that came from the citizens.
26219	77	The Italians have backed this civil miracle, and they have become the real protagonists of the policies that we occasionally put in the field.
26219	79	I think of patient respect for the restrictions to stop the pandemic, the extraordinary participation in the vaccination campaign.
26219	81	I think of the spontaneous reception offered to Ukrainian refugees, welcomed in homes and schools with affection and solidarity.
26219	83	I think about the involvement of local communities in the PNRR, which has made it the largest transformation project from the bottom of recent history.
26219	85	I’ve never been so proud to be Italian.
26219	87	Italy is strong when it knows how to be united.
26219	89	Unfortunately, with the passing of months, to this demand of cohesion that came from citizens the political forces have opposed a growing desire for distinction and division.
26219	91	The reforms of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, of the catastrophe, of the balneary concessions have shown a progressive disfarination of the majority on the modernization agenda of the country.
26219	93	In foreign policy, we have seen attempts to weaken the government’s support to Ukraine, to shake our opposition to President Putin’s draft.
26219	95	The demands for further debt became stronger just when the need for attention to debt sustainability was greater.
26219	97	The desire to go forward together has gradually exhausted and with it the ability to act effectively, with “tempestivity”, in the interests of the country.
26219	99	As I said in the Council of Ministers, last Thursday’s vote confirmed the end of the trust agreement that this majority held together.
26219	101	Not to vote for trust in a government of which you are part is a clear political gesture, which has an obvious meaning.
26219	103	It is not possible to ignore it, because it would equal to ignore Parliament.
26219	105	You can’t contain it, because it would mean that anyone can repeat it.
26219	107	It is not possible to minimize it, because it comes after months of strappi and ultimatum.
26219	109	The only way, if we still want to stay together, is to rebuild this covenant, with courage, altruism, credibility.
26219	111	This is especially questioned by the Italians.
26219	113	The mobilization of these days by citizens, associations, territories for the prosecution of the Government is unprecedented and impossible to ignore.
26219	115	It involved the third sector, school and university, the world of economics, professions and entrepreneurship, sports.
26219	117	This is an immersed support, but for which I am extremely grateful.
26219	119	Two calls hit me in a special way.
26219	121	The first is that of about 2,000 mayor, authorities used to confront daily with the problems of their communities.
26219	123	The second is that of the health staff, the heroes of the pandemic, to whom our collective gratitude is immense.
26219	125	This demand of stability implies us all to decide whether it is possible to re-create the conditions with which the Government can truly govern.
26219	127	This is the heart of our debate today.
26219	129	This is the sense of commitment we must face in front of the citizens.
26219	131	Italy needs a government capable of moving effectively and timely on at least four fronts.
26219	133	The National Rehabilitation and Resilience Plan is a unique opportunity to improve our long-term growth, create opportunities for young people and women, heal inequalities from those between the north and the south.
26219	135	By the end of this year, we have to 55 goals, which will allow us to receive a new rate of EUR 19 billion.
26219	137	The objectives cover key topics such as digital infrastructure, tourism support, university accommodation and scholarship creation, and the struggle against overwhelming work.
26219	139	The completion of the PNRR is a serious question to our citizens and to our European partners.
26219	141	If we don’t show how to spend this money efficiently and honestly, it will be impossible to ask for new common instruments for crisis management.
26219	143	The advancement of the PNRR requires the realization of the many investments that make up it.
26219	145	From the railways to the broadband, from the node asylum to the community houses, we have to commit to realizing all the projects we have designed with the decisive contribution of the local communities.
26219	147	We must be united against useless bureaucracy, which too often delays the development of the country.
26219	149	And we must ensure that the territorial authorities – starting from the municipalities – have all the necessary tools to overcome any implementation problems.
26219	151	At the same time, we have to proceed with the reforms that, along with investments, are the heart of the PNRR.
26219	153	The reform of the public procurement code aims to ensure the rapid realization of public works and the strengthening of the instruments for the fight against corruption.
26219	155	We must keep the mafia away from the PNRR.
26219	157	It is the best way to honor the memory of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the men and women of their scorts, thirty years after their barbaric murder.
26219	159	The reform of the contract code has been approved, and the work is on the preparation of the schemes of delegated decrees that are to be dismissed by March of next year.
26219	161	The reform of competition is aimed at promoting growth, reducing revenues, fostering investment and employment.
26219	163	With this spirit, we have adopted rules to remove the obstacles to the opening of markets, to the protection of consumers.
26219	165	The reform concerns local public services, including taxis, and goods and services concessions, including bathroom concessions.
26219	167	The draft law must be approved before the summer break, in order to allow the further approval of the delegated decrees, as provided for in the PNRR, by the end of the year.
26219	169	Now we need a convinced support for the executive’s action – not a support for unauthorized, and sometimes violent protests against the government’s majority.
26219	171	As regards justice, we approved the reform of criminal proceedings, civil proceedings and failure proceedings and brought the reform of tax justice to Parliament.
26219	173	These reforms are essential to have fair and fast processes, as the Italians ask us.
26219	175	It is a matter of freedom, democracy, and even prosperity.
26219	177	The deadlines indicated in the PNRR are very accurate.
26219	179	We must end the procedure for the decrees for the implementation of the civil and criminal delegation law by the end of the year.
26219	181	The tax justice reform law is in question in the Senate, and must be approved by the end of the year.
26219	183	Finally, last autumn the Government gave way to the draft law delegation for the tax revision.
26219	185	We are aware that in Italy the tax is complex and often unfair.
26219	187	Therefore, we have never increased tax on citizens.
26219	189	However, it is necessary to do this with an effort of transparency.
26219	191	We intend to reduce the Irpef rates from the middle-low income; to overcome the Irap; to rationalize the Iva.
26219	193	The first steps were made with the latest budget law, which initiated the revision of the Irpef and the reform of the recovery system.
26219	195	In Italy, the Revenue-Riscovery Agency has 1.100 billion euros of remaining, i.e. unrecovered credits, equal to more than 60% of the national GDP – an impressive figure.
26219	197	We must therefore approve the tax reform as soon as possible, which includes the completion of the recovery reform, and change immediately after the implementing decrees.
26219	199	In addition to the PNRR, a real social agenda is needed, starting from the weakest, such as disabled and non-self-sufficient elderly.
26219	201	The increase in energy costs and the return of inflation have caused new inequalities, which worsen those produced by the pandemic.
26219	203	Since the start of the government, we have shared with the trade unions and corporate associations a method of work that provides regular meetings and working tables.
26219	205	This method has already been used to manage some emergencies in the country: from the restoration of production activities in the pandemic phase to the safety of work, on which much has been done and much remains to do.
26219	207	Today it is essential to continue this comparison and to define in a shared perspective the interventions to be carried out in the next budget law.
26219	209	This year, the development of public finances is better than expected and allows us to intervene, as we have done so far, without new budgets.
26219	211	It is necessary to adopt within the early days of August a thorough measure to mitigate the impact on citizens and of increased energy costs, and then to strengthen the purchasing power, especially of the weakest populations.
26219	213	Reducing the tax burden on workers, starting from the lowest wages, is a medium-term goal.
26219	215	This is a point of agreement between trade unions and entrepreneurs.
26219	217	With the last budget law we have adopted a first and temporary intervention.
26219	219	We need to add another within a short time, within the limits permitted by our financial availability.
26219	221	It is also necessary to renew collective contracts.
26219	223	Many, including those of trade and services, have expired for too many years.
26219	225	Collective contracting is one of the strengths of our industrial model, for the extension and quality of the protections, but it does not yet reach all workers.
26219	227	On the European level, a minimum wage directive is in the process of final approval, and it is in this direction that we must move, together with the social parties, by ensuring wage levels worthy to the most suffered groups of workers.
26219	229	Citizenship income is an important measure to reduce poverty, but it can be improved to foster those in most need and reduce the negative effects on the labour market.
26219	231	There is a need for a pension reform that ensures outgoing flexibility mechanisms and a sustainable facility, anchored with the contributive system.
26219	233	Italy must continue to re-design its energy policy, as it has been done in these months.
26219	235	This week’s Summit in Algeria confirms our absolute determination to diversify suppliers, pushing convincedly on renewable energy.
26219	237	This requires the necessary infrastructure.
26219	239	We need to accelerate the installation of the rigassificators – in Piombino and Ravenna.
26219	241	It is not possible to say that they want the energy security of the Italians and then, at the same time, protest against these infrastructures.
26219	243	These are safe plants, essential for our energy needs, for the maintenance of our production tissue.
26219	245	In particular, we must finish the installation of the Piombino rigassifier by the coming spring.
26219	247	It is a matter of national security.
26219	249	At the same time, we must move forward with the greatest urgency the energy transition to clean sources.
26219	251	By 2030, we need to install about 70 GW of renewable energy plants.
26219	253	The drought and the abnormal heat waves that have invested Europe in the past few weeks remind us of the urgency of seriously dealing with the global climate crisis.
26219	255	I also think of interventions to improve water management, whose maintenance has often been seriously defective.
26219	257	The PNRR spends more than 4 billion dollars for these investments, to which a more urgent “water plan” is to be funded.
26219	259	With regard to energy efficiency measures and more generally building bonuses, we intend to deal with the criticism in the delivery of tax credits, but at the same time to reduce the generosity of contributions.
26219	261	As I promised in my settlement speech, and supported by you in this hall, this government fully identifies itself in the European Union, in the transatlantic bond.
26219	263	Our position is clear and strong: in the heart of the European Union, the G7, the NATO.
26219	265	We must continue to support Ukraine in any way, as this Parliament has committed the Government to do with a parliamentary resolution.
26219	267	As President Zelensky told me at the phone, weapons to Ukraine is the only way to allow the Ukrainians to defend themselves.
26219	269	At the same time, we must continue to engage in search of negotiating solutions, starting from the grain crisis.
26219	271	And we must increase our efforts to combat the interference by Russia and other autocracies in our politics, in our society.
26219	273	Italy is a free and democratic country.
26219	275	In front of those who want to try to seduce us with their authoritarian model, we must respond with the strength of European values.
26219	277	The European Union is our home and within it we have to pursue ambitious challenges.
26219	279	We must continue to fight to get a roof to the price of Russian gas, which would benefit everyone, and for the reform of the electricity market, which can start with the domestic even before European agreements.
26219	281	These measures are essential to protect the purchasing power of families and to protect the production levels of.
26219	283	In Europe, there will also be discussions about the reform of the common budget and defence rules, the overcoming of the principle of unanimousness.
26219	285	In all these fields, Italy has a lot to say – with credibility, constructive spirit, and without any subalternity.
26219	287	There are other commitments that the executive wants to undertake that include, for example, the reform of the system of basic doctors and the discussion for the recognition of forms of differentiated autonomy.
26219	289	But all this requires a government that is truly strong and coherent and a Parliament that accompanies it with conviction, in mutual respect for the roles.
26219	291	It is not necessary for Italy a trust of facade, which disappears in the face of uncomfortable measures.
26219	293	We need a new, sincere and concrete treaty of confidence, as it has so far allowed us to change the country to better.
26219	295	Parties and you parliamentarians - are you ready to reconstruct this treaty?
26219	297	Are you ready to confirm the effort you made in the first few months, and that has then become less?
26219	299	I am here, in this hall, today, at this point of discussion, just because the Italians have asked it.
26219	301	You don’t have to give this answer to me, but you have to give it to all Italians.
26224	1	Draghi meets (only) his friend Letta. From the pastoral to the central government?
26224	3	Rome, 19 lug – It was so that Mario Draghi met Enrico Letta, a faithful companion of adventures and (especially) disadvantages of the government of the mediocre. He only met him (for now), without troubling allies that question the alliance, right to evaluate what to do. Is it hypothesis? A central-left government, with a few pieces of Forza Italy and without the League.
26224	5	Draghi encounters (only) Letta. Italy’s League and Force: “Sconcerto”
26224	7	Possible? There are many different types of cookies that can be used for the purposes of our website. It is the most important thing that you can do when you’re going to get a lot of money and you’re going to get a lot of money. And what, even some centralist stamps that always point to the necessity, to fish a little in the Mixed Group, a little here, a little there, so many new Christians host everywhere. And then it turns out, someone willing to keep the burning bark standing and keep you planted inside the chair is always. It is in fact that in Lega and Forza Italy, today’s lunch went from a traction to the news of the conversation between Letta and the prime minister resigned. “At the beginning of the central-right government summit was disappointed because President Mario Draghi received the secretary of the Pd and not the leaders of the other majority parties, after, by the other hand, a political check was requested,” the Ansa revealed, citing sources of the central-right government gathered in Villa Grande.
26224	9	Now, because in the Roman residence of Berlusconi, leghists, forciers and what remains of the UDC discussed how to repeat the Veto to the Five Stars, when they suddenly met with this pleasant news. What do you think about Salvini-Cav? Will he pretend a candle-fire meeting late in the evening, will he jump the bank or will he silently wait until Draghi's speech is scheduled tomorrow? In fact, regardless of the mid-right movements and as much as the road of the Draghi bis appears more and more impoverished, a way to adjust the cows is always found in order to avoid elections.
26224	11	In fact, among the main parties that make up the Parliament (but not the majority), only Fratelli d’Italia continues to demand with a loud voice the return to the urns. “To hear the press it seems that all Italy is asking Draghi to stay, as if this government was in the heart of all the Italians. But then the same press warns that if he voted, he would destroy who is in the opposition. Typical cognitive dissonants of the left,” writes on Twitter Giorgia Meloni. “It’s because they’re trying all of them to avoid returning to the vote...”, adds FdI’s leader on Facebook, publishing a recent Swg survey that gives Fd to 23.8%. It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do.
26227	1	Not again! Biden reveals $700 million to Ukraine's weapons!
26227	3	While promising not to send long-range missiles to Ukraine, President Biden announced that he will send long-range missiles to Ukraine. It has also revealed another $700 million in weapons for Ukraine (this part of $40 billion... or is it already exhausted?). Even today: EUROPOL (finally) wakes up with the mock of billions of weapons flooding Europe from Ukraine.

2623	1	Soros calls for Putin's defeat 
2623	3	Unless Russia is quickly defeated in Ukraine, the collective West will not be able to deal with climate change in time to save civilization, billionaire funder George Soros said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He also described Russia and China as the biggest threats to its concept of open society.
2623	5	"Russia's shipping of troops to Ukraine ""may have been the beginning of the Third World War and our civilization may not survive,"" Soros said to the WEF, and even when the fighting will stop, ""the situation will never return to the previous one."""
2623	7	"In his story, the ""invasion"" took place in the middle of a struggle between ""two diametrally opposite government systems: open society and closed society"", the first incarnated by the West and the second by Russia and China."
2623	9	"Soros, 91, recalled the ""emotive days"" of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when his wealth increased to the point that he could spend $300 million a year in 1987, and his foundations in Eastern Europe ""revealed more effective than I expected."""
2623	11	The Hungarian financer has not mentioned the collapse of the living level that is followed by the common citizens.
2623	13	He stated that the marriage began to change after the attacks of September 11, 2001, “repressive regimes are now rising and open societies are under an asset,” with China and Russia representing “the greatest threat.”
2623	15	"However, Soros was optimistic about how that struggle would go. According to him, Russian troops should be welcomed in Ukraine as liberators and come out victorious within days or weeks, but Ukraine has been able to ""configure"" them with the help of the United States and NATO. Meanwhile, he said that Chinese leader Xi Jinping damaged his legitimacy with the Covid-19 blockade in Shanghai and elsewhere."
2623	17	What Soros really worried, however, was that the conflict in Ukraine would interfere with the environmental agenda, which means that climate change could become irreversible.
2623	19	“The best and the only way to preserve our civilization is to defeat Putin as soon as possible,” he added.“It could be the end of our civilization,” he said, insisting on the fact that “we must mobilize all our resources to soon end the war.”
2623	21	"On Monday, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger urged the WEF to mediate a peace in Ukraine in the next two months, before Russia is pushed into a ""permanent alliance with China"" that would destabilize Europe."
2623	23	"""Russia has been an essential part of Europe for 400 years,"" 98-year-old Kissinger observed, warning those seeking the ""defeat"" of Moscow."
26230	1	Zelensky: We prepare an army of a million soldiers
26230	3	Ukraine is gathering a million military forces equipped with Western weapons to recover the southern territories occupied by Russia. This was by Kiev’s Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov in an interview with the Sunday Times. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, he gave orders to develop plans for the liberation of coastal areas, considered vital for the country. “We understand that it is politically necessary. The president has commissioned the High Command to develop the plans, and the major state will communicate what is needed,” Reznikov explained.
26230	5	Zelensky: Russian officials of Donetsk attacks will be punished
26230	7	“A missile attack on the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. All those who give orders for such raids, all those who execute them targeting our cities, residential areas, kill absolutely deliberately. After such attacks, they can’t say they don’t know or have not understood. The punishment is inevitable for any Russian murderer. Absolutely everyone.” The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, said this in a video message on social media.
26231	1	It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do.
26231	3	Taranto, 13 lug – The arrival to the port of Taranto of the Geo Barents, the boat of the NGO Medical Without Borders with 314 clandestines, is scheduled for today. The announcement of the Italian authorities arrived after midnight yesterday as the ship was moving forward and back in front of the Sicilian coast of Agrigento. The number of landings is increasing exponentially, and it is ready to sign new records, facing an absolute inherent political class; ministers and ministers reduced to make from simple traffic disruptors. You go here, you go there, and so on.
26231	5	This shipping traffic that the NGOs have powered to dismissure allowing trafficers to increase the profits – they and those who then manage receipt and maintenance. Of the figures that turn around the business of the reception, which would be better to call the trade of the new slaves, we have spoken more and more times also in the context of all those projects, justly funded.
26231	7	for integration. This is an operation, which seems less unlikely. Just read the black chronicle news of any daily in any part of Italy to understand it.
26231	9	Immigration in the time of Covid and Crisis
26231	11	Now the question arises spontaneously: but in an international context in which the energy crisis, the balances between superpowers, the rigour that Draghi is ready to push to the nation to save on gas, light and water (for another emergency, that of drought) how can Italy continue to be charged with hundreds of thousands of immigrants?
26231	13	And to remain in the issue of emergency comes from Trapani the other complaint about the management of illegal immigration in the times of Covid. The provincial secretariat of the trade union organization of the State Police “Italy Celere” issued a press release in which it is written to clear letters the inadequacy of the “accueil system”. It is associated, above all, with the pandemic and the lack of concrete responses for the health security of police operators, civilians operating within the C.P.R. This is the first time I’ve been able to do this, and I’ve been able to do this.
26231	15	“In the last few weeks there have been transfers from Pantelleria to Trapani of subjects landed irregularly on the island, among which many are in ‘self-surveillance regime’ as ‘strict contacts’ of subjects positive results Covid at the act of landing. In particular, among all the transfers, 7 who were in the aforementioned condition, with expiry of the self-surveillance scheduled for the day 14 July 2022, were detained at the C.P.R. It is the only way to get a lot of money, but it is the only way to get a lot of money.
26231	17	The Covid Ship in Freedom
26231	19	He said in a statement: “The stranger, F.M. This is the first time I have been able to do it, and I have been able to do it, and I have been able to do it, and I have been able to do it, and I have been able to do it, and I have been able to do it, and I have been able to do it, and I have been able to do it, and I have been able to do it. So far, all the good could be said, since the seven subjects were, and are, within a separate sector of the C.P.R., specially prepared to prevent potentially infected subjects from getting in touch with the other foreigners already detained at the C.P.R. Among all the foreigners transferred in the last few weeks is the number of subjects subject to the self-surveillance regime very high and the number of foreigners that, after receiving the notification of a Resignation Agreement, as it was not possible to hold them at a C.P.R. National for lack of places, they were recipients of an Order of the Investigator to leave the national territory within gg.7”.
26231	21	You could stop here already! But the statement goes beyond: “This U.S. It fears the birth of COVID focolai within the facilities for ‘asylants’ and raises the strong doubt that the irregular recipients of the Order of the Questor, free to scratch for Italy, observe the requirements of wearing a FFP2 mask, when closed or in the presence of assemblies, until the tenth day following the date of the last close contact. In practice, thanks to the wrong management of the transfers from Pantelleria, potential biological weapons have been put into circulation on the national territory, which we don’t know where they will be damaged. It appears clear to this Secretariat that something does not work in the methodology used in the management of the clandestines arriving on our coasts, which sends these subjects into clock bombs for the health of the operators of the FF.PP., for the operators of the C.P.R. operator entity, for the foreigners themselves and for any citizen who, I don’t know, comes in contact with them.”
26231	23	“Our U.S., as much as you seek to be conciliating and as much as you seek to find a dialogue with the proposed Institutions, cannot transgire on the protection of the health of the Men in Divise and this should be a fundamental interest also of Prefecture and Question. The O.S. It shall pay maximum attention to the decisions taken in relation to the above, because the reception cannot, nor should, be absolutely prior to the public health and the health of workers. The responsibility for certain wrong choices lies on the lives of the police and their families.”
26231	25	Italians in quarantine, free immigrants
26231	27	Have you all understood? Companies, workers, elderly, children all subject to prohibitions and restrictions for two and a half years and with the threat to start back in September as there are those who shake free and without any obligation in our same cities. In this case, it is necessary to ensure that you have the right to obtain the right to obtain the right to obtain the right to obtain the right to obtain the right. What statistics are referred to? The question we have asked to many Entities and Authorities, but no answer...Who hides, and why?
26232	1	Meloni, Giuliani (ex mayor of New York): will be the Italian Margaret Thatcher.
26232	3	Rudolph - Rudy - Juliani, former Republican mayor of New York, lawyer and conservative politician does not save and demolishes the map castle built on the government of Draghi, explaining how the media that are intervening in these hours to scredit the party of the patriots and conservatives of the FDI, are just political instruments of censorship; other than authorized information bodies.
26232	5	Giorgia Meloni is the Italian Margaret Thatcher. Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City. The conservative politician, famous for implementing the “zero tolerance” doctrine against the crime in the Great Mela, interviewed the other day in a podcast on the Rumble platform, said he had no doubt.
26232	7	Meloni will have to take the opportunity lost to Silvio Berlusconi and give Italy a government that ends the socialist methods and realizes in Italy a free market economy capable of removing it out of the mole of the crisis.
26232	9	And about the economic crisis Giuliani has not saved sharp criticism just to that Mario Draghi who continues to be presented by the mainstream as the Lord’s unto. It’s part of that club that has ruined Europe says Giuliani.
26232	11	“The fact – he said is that Draghi was a failure, yes, he got a great rescue from the EU but in exchange for very severe economic reforms that he had to carry out in Italy.
26232	12	Well, those economic reforms have not been achieved and the Italian economy is among the worst of the European countries, in fact the concern is that it can draw down the EU economy.
26232	13	So I don’t understand how Draghi can be considered a success, I want to say he is a success as Biden is a success, in the minds of the European left. He belongs to that club, he is part of that club, and they ruined... that club ruined the economy of Europe, and Italy is one of the main victims.”
26232	14	And still Giuliani attacked the New York Times and those media that began again – at the fall of the Draghi government – to launch fantomatic accusations of fascism against Fratelli d’Italia and the same Giorgia Meloni.
26232	15	Well, they, for how they dishonestly cover news and hide things, constantly violate the first amendment (US Constitution – freedom of speech n.d.r.This makes them more fascists than anyone they are going to write, so I don’t consider them at all serious, where they have censored the news of the hard disk (Hunter Biden n.d.r.) For 18 months and then, they finally admitted that it was true. Is this really a newspaper? Or is it a fascist political movement that likes to blame people’s right of expression? “It’s what it needs for Italy and it’s also one that believes in the free business system that it needs to be saved in Italy, you know it’s at the boundary of collapse if it’s not collapse already...”
26236	1	Malta rejects French NGOs in Italian port: 314 more crashes in arrival
26236	3	Foreign NGOs continue to attack Italy. Malta, when it is called in the case, rejects it in Italy. And they are placed in front of our gates.
26236	5	From the beginning of the year:
26236	7	Foreign NGOs have removed 10,500 illegal people in Italy since the beginning of the year
26236	9	The costs should be transferred to the flag governments. Especially the clandestines.
26236	11	The NGOs in pressing on our country with the last claim of a safe harbour, launch the endless ultimatum along our coasts. It was the Ocean Viking, which on Wednesday brought 306 passengers on board to Pozzallo. Today it is the Geo Barents of Medici Without Borders, which has already been located about 14 miles from the border of Italian territorial waters near Augusta: one of the most hunted scales and among the most generosely elarged as pos. And that again claimed with a veevent saying: “A positive response must be given now,” they tune from the NGO. In short, the complicated redistribution of the 2,000 migrants from Lampedusa to the other reception centers in our country does not stop traffickers and humanitarian organizations that, imperterrites, continue to make routes on our borders. to preside our coasts. And to demand one of our ports.
26236	13	Migrants, with our coasts collapsing the Geo Barents presses for the landing of the 314 on board
26236	15	While Malta, France, and in this case Norway – the Geo Barents, in particular, slaughtering the Norwegian flag – make scratches. We know that the problem will come to us again. It is the only way to get to know what is going on in the future. Safe landing place, where migrants arrive and are subjected to health triage, before they are (eventually) transferred to Norway. But where, look carefully, they never come. And where the 314 will not even arrive this time on board the Medici Without Borders ship, after our authorities – which will be taken over – will go to distribute them from the various Belpaese reception centers. This is the case with the Viminal who, more usually, is silent and consensus.
26236	17	In short, that even for the 314 on board the Geo Barents that the landing port will be an Italian arrival is obvious. It is scam. It is a matter of the demand that strengthens the tones. This case, like all those that have preceded it until today, is the chronicle of an announced landing that reads to the subject the same copy of ever. As far as the NGOs, as the Daily also emphasizes in these hours, “do not turn to other countries to ask for landing, despite the number of those that appear on the Mediterranean basin. Or better – continues the Milan newspaper – Geo Barents has forwarded the request to Malta, well knowing that the authorities of the isolated country will never respond to the request. He decided to start pressing against the Italian borders, while battling a foreign flag.
26245	1	Orban, 'EU changes strategy, West negotiations between Moscow and Kiev'
26245	3	The Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban again spoke about the war in Ukraine and attacked the strategy that Brussels has set in place so far. “There is a need for a new strategy that is not focused on the victory of the war but on an adequate offer of peace,” Orban said on Twitter. The task of the West is not to take the parts of someone, but to be between the Russians and the Ukrainians: “There will not be peace until there will be a peace negotiation between Russia and the United States.”

""Europe should not pursue a role in world politics until it is able to deal with foreign policy issues ""in its own courtyard,"" Orban attacked adding: ""West is losing the battle of natural resources and raw materials"" and international politics is destroying the Russian-German energy axis."" ""Today, the situation is that the Russians sell less energy but have a lot more income,"" the EU is losing because its energy deficit is tripled. After suffering from national challenges, the prime minister reiterated some of the key points that, for months, divide Budapest from Brussels. ""If we stay out of war, migration, gender foolishness, global minimum tax and economic recession, Hungary will be able to maintain its success,"" Orban said."
26249	1	The Ukrainian ports are working again. Moscow: “Return of Russian exports”
26249	3	"The Ukrainian ports are “return to work”. This was by the Ukrainian Navy on the day in which the coordination center was opened in Istanbul to allow Ukrainian ships to safely pass in the Black Sea after the agreement between Kiev, Moscow and the UN with the mediation of Turkey. And this while Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko said that the agreement mediated by Turkey to unlock Ukrainian grain exports to the Black Sea could come less ""if the barriers to Russia's agricultural exports will not be quickly removed."" This is by Interfax. Rudenko says grain ships from Ukraine will begin soon and hopes that the agreement will remain valid."

Blinken has not entered the details ""for security reasons"". This is a “substantial” proposal, Blinken reiterated. It is probably a prison exchange as it happened to the former marine Trevor Reed."
26249	7	Meanwhile, after 62 years of operations in the country, Tetra Pak leaves Russia and sells its production to a local dealer. According to the multinational that produces integrated food processing and packaging systems, the economic sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia, after the invasion of Ukraine, have made trade with Moscow impossible. “The cumulative effect of export restrictions to Russia has led to an unstable supply chain, which pushes the company to have no alternative to that of leaving the country,” Tetra Pak writes. The company was founded in Lund, a city in southern Sweden, in 1951 and today has a global market, among the leading companies in the food packaging industry. The TT agency reports that its operations in Russia last year registered have a value of €430 million.
26249	9	In Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky nominates Andriy Kostin, a legislator of his party, the next general prosecutor of the country. This is by Ukrinform. Zelensky submits a formal request to the Parliament that the assembly vote to confirm the appointment of Kostin who will replace Irina Venediktova, withdrawn from the post of general prosecutor at the beginning of the month.
26249	11	"Mykhailo Podoliak, Zelensky's counselor, claims on Twitter the attack on Kherson's main bridge and calls on the Russians to leave the occupied city on which the Ukrainians launched a counteroffensive. ""You can call the Antonivs'ky bridge a means of air defense that intercepts all Ukrainian missiles, but you can't escape the reality: the occupants should learn to swim through the river Dnipro. Or they should leave Kherson as long as it is still possible. There may not be a third warning,” he explains. So Zelensky adds: 'Day by day, our defenders effectively hit enemy positions by turning the plans of the occupants. The Himars and other precision weapons are changing the course of the war for us. And although the Ukrainian army's firepower is lower than the enemy's, our warriors still hit with greater skill and accuracy thanks to the US-made missiles."

26251	1	"Russian gas, von der Leyen: ""EU is preparing for new cuts"""
26251	3	"The President of the European Commission announces: ""Emergency plan by mid-July"""
26251	5	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen calls on the EU to prepare for the event that Russia will “fullly” cut its gas supplies. “We have to prepare for further problems in gas supplies, including for a complete cutting by Russia,” he said in the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg – in total today 12 member countries are directly affected by a total or partial reduction in gas supplies.”
26251	7	“It’s obvious: Vladimir Putin continues to use energy as a weapon. This is why the Commission is working on an emergency plan: we will present this plan and the necessary instruments by the middle of July. Member States have their respective national emergency plans already in force. This is positive, but it requires European coordination and joint action. We must make sure that, in the event of severe difficulties, the gas flows to the places where it serves the most. We must provide European solidarity. And we must protect the single market and the industry’s value chains,” he said.
26251	9	"Natural gas stocks in the EU ""one week ago were at 55% and now we should be above"" that threshold. The G7 has decided to work internationally to reach a “potencial mechanism” that imposes a roof on the price of Russian oil. “There will be a global approach, a alliance of many countries willing to put a roof on the price of Russian oil, and there will be a need to convince many countries that don’t want to join the alliance so that they don’t shake the roof.”"
26251	11	“This potential oil price roof could also be a good platform if we should look, in special circumstances, to a gas price roof.” “We could activate, if necessary, mechanisms such as a Sure plan of loans to finance the expenses needed to deal with the energy crisis, but it’s not part of the emergency plan that the Commission will present by the middle of July.
26251	13	The President of the European Commission compared the resistance of the Ukrainians to the Russian invasion with the resistance of the Czechoslovaks against the Russian carriers sent in August 1968 to repress the experiment of ‘human-faced socialism’ by the secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Alexander Dubcek.
26251	15	"""The Ukrainians - says von der Leyen intervening in the European Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg, on the occasion of the opening of the Czech presidency of the EU Council - have faced, without weapons, the Russian invasion. Citizens talked to the Russian soldiers, they wrote to them, they evoked the absurdity of this war in all public spheres. They are images that remind us of another invasion, another phase of opposition. It was in Prague in 1968: you will remember the demonstrations of the Czechs, young and less young, who opposed themselves on the streets of Prague"" to the Russian invasion. So, ""I can't imagine a better country than the Czech Republic to take the presidency of the EU Council. We are in a struggle for freedom, peace and self-determination,” he concludes."
26253	1	Turkish Defense Minister: Russia has nothing to do with Odessa bombings
26253	3	Kosovo delays for a month the ban on the use of Serbian cards and documents that has led to the current escalation
26253	5	Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar has issued some statements about the explosions in the city of Odessa, which the Kiev regime attributes to a Russian missile attack.
26253	7	"In a statement collected by the Anadolu agency correspondent, Akar said that this morning there was an explosion in Odessa and in this regard he said: ""We received information that there was a missile attack and about this we had a telephone conversation with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov and Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Aleksandr Kubrakov. We received the necessary information. They said there was a missile attack. They said one of the missile attacks hit one of the silos, the other fell in a area near the silos, but the important thing is that there is no negativity in the load capacity and capacity of the mole, and that the activities in Odessa can continue.”"
26253	9	Then the Turkish minister that he was in contact with Russia: “In addition, in our contact with Russia, the Russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and that they were examining the issue very closely and in detail. The fact that such an incident occurred immediately after the agreement we made yesterday regarding grain shipping really worried us. However, we continue to comply with our responsibilities in the agreement we reached yesterday and we also expressed in our meetings that we are at the disposal of the parties to continue their cooperation with peace and patience.”
26253	11	Akar also added that the agreement will be implemented as soon as possible: “Now with the beginning of these talks, there has been a price decline as the experts said, that this should be continued and that it is very important in terms of humanity, in terms of meeting the food needs, in terms of rescue of people waiting for the grain. Our cooperation with Ukraine will continue. We have fulfilled and will continue to fulfill our responsibilities in the memorandum of agreement that we signed during the meeting yesterday. In this context, we have multiplied our efforts since yesterday for the functioning of the Joint Coordination Centre, as stipulated in the agreement. Including the representative of the United Nations, representatives of Russia and Ukraine have now begun to work together with Turkey on joint coordination. Our hope and desire is that these and similar events will be removed quickly and these studies will be completed.as soon as possible in accordance with the agreement we have reached. At the moment, we are closely monitoring the incident and keeping our contacts. It is our hope and hope that these work will continue as desired, as indicated in the agreement.”
26260	1	Following Putin is bringing orbs to the barrier – For five days in Budapest there are many protests against the Orban’s tax reform – In its fourth review it is the first part that the first Hungary must face mass protests – In expensive costs it is the philo-Putin line on gas and oil: the energy crisis now has prevented it to eliminate the sovereignty for the categories of protection. The inflation is on the stars.
26260	3	The first protests began last Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered on a bridge on the Danube, where the Országház, the fasting Gothic palace of the Parliament, also appears. At the time, the protesters had blocked the traffic in the center of Budapest for three hours. yesterday there were a few thousand Hungarians to demonstrate against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in the fifth day in a row of protests.
26260	5	To bring the magicians to the street is a new law desired by the nationalist and conservative prime minister. The measure is intended to boost the tax burden to hundreds of thousands of traders and self-employed workers, support the protesters who raised cartels and screamed heavy slogans to the head of the government.
26260	7	The protests sign an unexpected decline in popularity for Orbán, whose Hungarian Civil Union (Fidesz) won with a wide margin the legislative elections last April. In many, especially in Europe, they had hoped in the victory of Orbán’s challenger, that Peter Marki-Zay who today tries to caval the protests, posed under the leadership of a heterogeneous coalition of centralists, social-democrats, ecologists and former right-wing extremists.
26260	9	Three months ago, the Prime Minister in power without a continuous solution since 2010 was confirmed with a large 52% of the consensus. Orbán had conducted the last break-in election campaign with the European Union, demonstrating the unavailability of a Hungary dependent on Russian hydrocarbons to break with Vladimir Putin’s Russia.
26260	11	Curiously, its government is now facing the strongest wave of protests just because of energy: the parliament controlled by Fidesz has made a clean place of protected categories by establishing that those who consume more energy than the average will have to pay it at the market price and no longer on the basis of the tariffs subsidized by the state. It was the first time the Prime Minister’s intervention on Friday at the radio that defended the law as “good and necessary.”
26260	13	Two days earlier the government had declared the “energy state of emergency”, announcing a greater use of coal and calling on families to moderate their consumption. In late May, Orbán also blocked the EU’s plan for a total and immediate embargo on Russian oil.
26260	15	The controversial attitude of Budapest, however, did not prevent a strong weakening of the florin at the eve of the conflict served 367 of them to buy one euro, today they need 410. Associated with the rise of gas and oil on the global market, the decline of the national currency has precipitated Hungary into an inflation crisis that is costing Orbán a lot of popularity.
26260	17	According to the Központi Statisztikai Hivatal (the national statistical agency), the inflation rate in Hungary rose to 11.7% annually in June, in net growth compared to 10.7% in May and 9.5% in April. At the end of January, the Hungarian government had imposed a roof on the prices of six food products (semolated sugar, grain flour, grain seed oil, pig meat, chicken breasts and milk) between 1 February and 1 May 2022.
26260	19	Announced by Orbán himself, the measure helped the prime minister to win the elections.
26260	21	Surviving the economic shots of a very close war Hungary and Ukraine are neighboring countries is a new challenge.
26261	1	Next Next post: Hot Autumn? Not very cold
26261	3	The autumn is hot, or rather very cold. In Italy, the sirene of various alarms, which would seem distant and microscopic, but in reality are concrete. Let’s look at them in detail to understand what’s going on and to prevent them from spreading even in the next season, otherwise let’s prepare for a very cold, dark and expensive autumn.
26261	5	The most recent problem is the government crisis.
26261	7	The 5 Star Movement has not voted trust to the government on the Aid Decree which has been approved anyway. Draghi then presented himself in the Council of Ministers, declaring his resignations, which were rejected by Mattarella.
26261	9	There would be two scenarios: if Draghi decided to leave his office, he would go to the vote. This is a plausible but unwanted hypothesis, as measures such as: reduction of the price of gasoline, workers’ bonuses, PNRR targets and others will be followed.
26261	11	The other scenario would go ahead, but without the 5 stars. Thus it would continue until the natural expiration of the legislation, in 2023, so that the government will be able to continue to work on risky dossiers.
26261	13	All this happens at a very difficult time: war at the gates of Europe, inflation at the stars, and therefore an irresponsible and out-of-site attitude given the numerous and different crises that so far afflict Italy.
26261	15	To determine the energy crisis, driven by the sharp increase in gas costs, are mainly the war in Ukraine and the reduction of supply from Moscow.
26261	17	The public transport sector would be heavily affected by it, though it has a look to the future. To support the sector, a plan of funding, derived from the PNRR and national funds, was approved by 2033. The Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Giovannini, reiterated that investments for the future will have to focus on technological and digital innovation and environmental, social and economic sustainability, in order to succeed in the quality jump.
26261	19	In addition, to be a piece is also healthcare.
26261	21	Italian hospitals would seem to be an emergency in the emergency due to various criticisms: lack of hospital staff, lack of beds, organizational difficulties, lack of funding. Additionally, despite the Covid, in prepared rescue for a simple distortion in the cavity the average waiting time is long, the name “low rescue” would result in more appropriate. It is clear that the pandemic has shown the weakness of the health sector and the current emergency crisis is nothing more than the result and the peak of the iceberg of a hospital system.
26261	23	A further national alarm is represented by the rise of torride heat and the absence of rain, in fact after the drought is an emergency fire.
26261	25	Italy burns with rocks tripled in the last year compared to the historic average, more than one rocks every two days since the beginning of 2022, in a summer that comes after a spring classified as the sixth hotest ever on the planet. In these cases, prevention is a priority, as it is the need to team with civil protection, with the municipalities and with firefighters, who during the summer period, intensify the turns to address this emergency timely.
26261	27	However, you are expecting a decisively hot summer not only for temperatures, but also for light and gas prices.
26261	29	The drastic rise in electricity and methane tariffs is not a coincidence, as it is mainly due to Russia’s decisions to partially cut supplies to Germany and Italy. As a result, it seems increasingly important and decisive that the affected countries find alternative sources from which to supply themselves.
26261	31	Moreover, the times when the Draghi Government had to run to the repairs, to limit the impact of the bills, are numerous. For example, in the Decree of the Caro Energia of the end of June was confirmed the increase in system loads for the third quarter of the current year, concerned just by these new increases. Then the bonus 200 euros, in aid of employees, retirees and unemployed. The question is: will it be enough?
26261	33	Therefore, the economic framework – and not only – of our country depends strongly on the evolution of the war in Ukraine.
26261	35	The war would thus result in the “great judge” of the Italian situation.
26263	1	Rome is burning and the “monyet” is broken. Here is the wind of Italy.
26263	3	The capital of Rome? It is an Italian paradox. What is happening these days in the Eternal City has in the end nothing exceptional: it is the faithful mirror of a country in the fall. A country that suffocates for its never cured evils and for the invincible coat to repeat the same mistakes.
26263	5	The country drops in debts, as Rome drops in the “monyet” and in the smoke produced by the rocks in the squares of the eastern square of the city, fires filled with all probability by organized crime. And that’s because the “monyet” has always attracted various maffy, malfathers and malandrins. The suspicion of many is that the fires spread just as we talk about a thermovalorizer in the Capital. As to say: in the business you profile intend to enter both boss and sub-boss. They are sending fire signals.
26263	7	A perfect synchronism. As in the mysterious fire in the mega-discharica of Malagrotta, which caused the other emergency waste and produced for some time an even more mysterious disease among hundreds of Amma operators (the waste disposal company of Rome) who marked a visit. To then heal mysteriously, all together, in one night. And then they say that miracles do not exist.
26263	9	What do the Romanian citizens complain about? What is happening to them is only ordinary “Italy” sadness. If the citizens of East Rome are at risk of dioxin, what should then say the inhabitants of the area between Napoli and Caserta, where the soil is poisoned by highly toxic waste interrupted by Camorra?
26263	11	Italians and Romans. If Italy is indebted, Rome has long been immersed in the “buffs” (as in Romanian the debt is defined). How do we maintain the large army of the municipal workers? It is the beauty of 48,000 as a small Italian city. And we do not consider the destroyed army of workers in subcontracting services. A mass increased, counseling after counseling, in the race to the municipal councils.
26263	13	It is an Italian style, very Italian. Like the habit of removing problems, rather than dealing with them and solving them. It is not so much a fact of indolence, as of chronic incapacity of decision makers to decide, as close as they are among customers, power lobby, groups of ideological pressure.
26263	15	Because, in the end, it is just these samples of particularism that the Romans must thank for the dilagant “monyet” and the fires of sfasciacarrozze. Ideology and bureaucratic obsession did not allow the problem of waste removal in the Capital to be solved at the time of the municipality of Raggi, which pointed to the differentiated collection instead of thinking about the thermovalorizer, which was, the latter, an effective, but not ecologically correct solution. And his contribution to the past is also given by Nicola Zingaretti, who as president of the Lazio region gave reason to the mayor of Virginia, approving a plan that did not provide the waste burning facility. Ecologists should be satisfied, because they constitute a basin of left-wing votes. or not?
26263	17	The differentiated collection was a total failure. In compensation, the ecologists-animalists have had their satisfaction, as around the amounts of immune banqueted whole families of cinghals. This is the first time I’ve been able to do it, and I’ve been able to do it, and I’ve been able to do it. A divergence in the Pd house, which demonstrates the little lucidity of the Roman political ruling class.
26263	19	Now Gualtieri and the whole political nomenclature of Rome are waiting for the constitutional law that gives special powers, including regulatory autonomy, to the Capital. They are waiting for him as the strange learners are waiting for the magical backet. But we already know how it will end: the special powers will only serve to further cover the Romanian taxpayers, who already pay the highest local taxes in Italy, to then find the “money” for the roads and buses that sometimes go to fire.
26263	21	Everything in line with the Italian, tremendously Italian style.
26264	1	Iran's nuclear negotiations fail: another war is on the horizon?
26264	3	Iran has been at the heart of the international agenda.
26264	5	It has recently concluded the Tehran summit between Iran’s President Raissi, Russian President Putin and Turkish President Erdogan on Syria, war in Ukraine and more. But the most shocking question concerns the almost unfortunate failure of the negotiations for the restoration of the JCPOA, otherwise called “Iran nuclear agreement.”
26264	7	The agreement provided that Iran would eliminate its medium enrichment uranium reserves, cut by 98% the low enrichment uranium reserves and cut by two-thirds its gas centrifuges for thirteen years, while for the next fifteen years the enrichment of uranium could not exceed 3.67%, in order to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
26264	9	The agreement was signed by Iran and five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany in July 2015. The agreement was fiercely criticized by Israel and the U.S. Jewish community. Donald Trump, who succeeded in the post of U.S. President Barack Obama, then decreed the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement, restoring the sanctions on Iran.
26264	11	Biden has resumed negotiations with the Islamic Republic. Why did he do it? Simply because an Iran equipped with nuclear weapons terribly scares not only Israel, but also the other Arab countries, U.S. allies.
26264	13	But the negotiation for the restoration of the deal ended immediately on a dead binary. The U.S. would want to forever prevent Iran from possessing a nuclear technology that allows it to produce an atomic bomb; at the same time they do not want to remove the sanctions to the country of the Ayatollah. Without the U.S. sanctions, Iran would become a great power. On the other hand, the Iranian delegation has been irrevocable on this position: first the U.S. must eliminate the sanctions and then Iran will return to observe the JCPOA patterns regarding uranium enrichment. However, none of the two sides seem to withdraw from their positions.
26264	15	Considered therefore the almost certain failure of the negotiations, Joe Biden said he would stop Iran from producing an atomic bomb at all costs, if necessary even with the war.
26264	17	Is the possibility of a war between the United States and Iran realistic? In such a conflict, if Russia and China did not intervene, the superiority of the U.S. army over the Iranian would be shocking. But Iran, with its recent progress in the missile field, could raise to the ground Israel and U.S. bases in the Middle East. This is well before the star and strip army can deploy a credible military force on the territory. Are you willing to pay the same price?
26265	1	Strategika - The beginning of the end for the Ukrainian army?
26265	3	A certain guerrilla narration and NATO filed insists on the mainstream media to talk about Russia’s possible defeat on the field, as well as of the ghostly counterattacks of Ukrainian forces.
26265	5	A functional narration to continue sending weapons to the Kiev regime, although these weapons will have the only effect of producing only more destruction and unnecessary dead, being destroyed and captured by the Russian forces or sold subbank by the Ukrainians themselves.
26265	7	While the United States and Europe continue to expect a possible victory on the field, the news comes from the battlefield very differently.
26265	9	The French publication Strategy writes:
26265	11	The beginning of the end for the Ukrainian army?
26265	13	After the double defeat in the Lysychansk-Severodonetsk sector and the loss of more than 10,000 men (hurt, wounded, prisoners, dispersed) and the abandonment of 700 heavy combat materials and equipment, the bad news continues to accumulate for the army of Kiev with the continuation of the Russian and allied offensive in the Donbass.
26265	15	Today we learn that in the Soledar sector, as a result of the Russian airstrikes, the 24th mechanized brigade amounts to 2,500 men, equivalent to 60% of the initial force engaged. The 79th Aircraft Attack Brigade saw its losses exceed 80% of its initial force. In both cases, these two brigades are no longer able to fight as a formed unit.
26265	17	All these elements allow us to consider the possibility of a collapse of the Ukrainian army in the Donbass in the next fifteen days. The attacks by the Russians and their allies, less than 48 hours after the fall of Lysychansk, have not left the unrest to the escaping units to gather their refugees and find a cohesion reach on their new defence lines that, in addition, could now be taken behind in case of victory in Seversk and Krasnopolye in the Slaviansk sector.”
26265	19	Russia continues to move forward. Slowly but irresistible. The forces of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) and the Russian troops have entered the city of Seversk, which is under their operational control, TASS said citing a source close to the Lugansk People's militia.
26265	21	"""The allied forces have already entered Seversk (a city in the People's Republic of Donetsk controlled by the Ukrainian army). I can say that the city is under our operational control. Traffic operations are underway. Seversk will soon be completely liberated from the Ukrainian troops.”"
26265	23	The acquisition of Serversk was then confirmed by Vitaly Kiselev, Deputy Interior Minister of the LPR.
26265	25	“Seversk is under our control,” he told Channel One’s microphones.
26265	27	The situation on the ground is increasingly difficult for Ukraine, but the Kiev regime opens to not want to start any negotiations.
26265	29	According to Moscow Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, “this is not the position of the Ukrainian state, but a song singed by Washington, which the Kiev regime has agreed to perform.”
26284	1	The left of Terror: the race of the alarming titles against the right to incite fear in the voters
26284	3	For years they have accused Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni of cavalking the fears of the Italians. Do they need more security? “There is no policy on fear,” they objected. Do they need more immigration controls? “You don’t speculate about the fear of the other,” they replied.
26284	5	But now, watching certain titles, watching certain expressions on television, reading certain editorials and certain services seems that the progressive front is united by one goal: using the language of fear to alarm the voters, to give them the feeling that the apocalypse is near, that the catastrophe is behind the corner. The whole is immersed in one terrible color: the black.
26284	7	The Republic evokes “la falange”, the Spanish fascist party
26284	9	Let’s see some examples. Republic, more often, is distinguished. It opens first with a photo of Giorgia Meloni at the recent programmatic conference in Milan and with the title: La falange (the name of the Spanish fascist party). But not enough. It is a comment by Furio Colombo entitled “Promises of black face”. This is the story of an unfinished pessimism: “It’s not a good time in Italian history.” Then Berizzi spreads on the allies in Europe by Giorgia Meloni and on how she was labeled by Steve Bannon: “Post-Fascist fascist.” And there’s still an investigation on the “black feud” of Latin that would be the model that FdI looks at. Here, the Republic notes, Meloni chose his electoral college “blinded by an ideological loyalty never broken since that 18 December 1932, when Benito Mussolini announced the birth of Littoria.”
26284	11	“Tomorrow” warns on the “marche” of Georgia
26284	13	"The De Benedetti newspaper, Tomani, thus synthesizes the success of the Meloni line at the top of the central right: “The march on the Chigi palace.” Where the term march is connotative and denotative. It is all. And it plays everything in the perspective of the demonizing narrative that the left is using. There are two pages on Guido Crosetto’s “all affairs”. ""Fidelissimo"" of Georgia - notes the newspaper - and he could be elected as the prime minister of mediation. Therefore, he presents it as loose and ambiguous because he cannot be given the “fascist”..."
26284	15	The foolish forecasts of Paul Krugman
26284	17	On the Press, finally, we find the editorial of the economist Paul Krugman who prophesies foolish scenarios of crisis for Italy that risks to break down for the rise of the “antidemocratic forces”. And less bad than a few pages before Marcello Sorgi had warned: “As long as Meloni is already targeted by journalistic revelations about his post-fascist past, it doesn’t seem that they can manage to stop his race. Also, among the communications experts, there are those who say they could favour it, mobilizing in its nearest elections the reaction to a kind of sense of persecution.” A monkey that has not been collected to the left.
26285	1	The UN calls on Kiev, Moscow, the U.S. and the EU to comply with the agreements on Russian and Ukrainian grain
26285	3	After the autumn of yesterday with which Moscow warned that the agreement on the export of Ukrainian grain could fail if not the EU, the U.S. and Ukraine had failed to comply with the agreement concerning, contextually, the export of grain and Russian fertilizers blocked by the sanctions, now the United Nations comes into dispute with the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres. It welcomes the opening of the Istanbul Co-ordination Center for grain exports from Ukraine – which is one of the formal and substantial aspects of the agreement signed in Istanbul – calls on the parties to work to “effectively apply” the agreement with the aim of “reducing global food insecurity”.
26285	5	Today Moscow had complained that the double agreement signed in Turkey was not then fulfilled at the point where the EU and the U.S. would have to slow down the sanctions to allow, as it was decided, Russia to export grain and grain, these latter fundamental, among other things, for Italian agriculture.
26285	7	“The Secretary-General greeted the official opening of the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul,” Guterres’ deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said. He stressed that this agency “is made up of representatives of Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the UN”.
26285	9	“The work of the JCC will allow safe transportation, through commercial ships, grain, related food and fertilizers from three major Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea to the rest of the world. This will help respond effectively and prevent increased global food insecurity.”
26285	11	"""Together with the implementation of the memorandum of agreement between Russia and the Secretary-General of the United Nations to promote the access of Russian food and fertilizers to the global markets,"" Haq said. The JCC will help restore confidence in the global food market and lower food prices from the current levels.”"
26285	13	He said that Guterres “has thanked Turkey for providing the parties and the United Nations a platform to help make the Black Sea cereal initiative operational.” He thanked “Russia and Ukraine for having quickly appointed and sent their representatives to Istanbul.”
26285	15	But now the point is to make respect for both parties of the agreement, both what concerns Ukrainian grain, and what concerns Russian grain and fertilizers.
26296	1	Carbon and Uranus: Putin's gas war is changing German political balance
26296	3	Faced with the need to find new sources, Green and SPD must be ready to take initiatives contrary to their programmes, such as the extension of nuclear power plants. It is about energy that is now building consensus and Scholz, facing the turbine (repared) of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, understood it.
26296	5	On Wednesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took a photo in front of one of the Nord Stream gas pipeline turbines, currently stored at the Siemens Energy headquarters in Mülheim an der Ruhr. Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, the gas pipeline is at the heart of polemics: German (European) dependence on Russian gas is one of the main weapons in the hands of the Kremlin to disrupt the German and EU response to the invasion.
26296	7	Before the conflict, 45% of the gas imported from Germany came from Russia. It is a key source of energy for the country’s needs, both for its industrial production and in the context of the Energiewende, the energy turn that prevents to gradually abandon nuclear and fossil sources to invest in renewable, with gas as a crucial intermediate measure in this process. After the Russian invasion, Germany joined European sanctions, also blocking the activation of the Nord Stream 2, the doubling of the gas pipeline already existing for years highly debated at the European and global level. The work was already completed, but Scholz’s government prevented it from entering into operation. Berlin has also diversified its gas supply: the share of that from Russia has been reduced to 35%, but it is unlikely that it will be able to make it completely less before 2024.
26296	9	With the extension and intensification of the sanctions, in recent weeks Moscow has unilaterally decreased gas flow to Europe: currently the supply volumes are about 40% of the levels preceding the conflict. To motivate the reduction, the Kremlin talked about technical problems with the gas pipeline turbines. One of them was brought to Canada for repairs, but at that point she was detained due to sanctions. Robert Habeck, German Minister for Economy and Climate Protection, has asked Canada to send the turbine to Germany, so that he can then send it to Russia. But at that point, Moscow had burocratic problems for the sending.
26296	11	Scholz, therefore, said on Wednesday before the turbine, saying to the press that “the turbine works” and that “all is quite clear and simple: the turbine is there, and it can be delivered, but someone must clearly say that they want it.” A clear reference to Moscow. Scholz’s move is part of the widespread European skepticism on the Russian version regarding the interruption of service, but it also responds to the demands of Germany. Just because of its energy dependence on Russia, in fact, the government had to make emergency decisions, which in several cases also contradict the direction that the government had announced to take in the phase of its settlement.
26296	13	This concerned, in particular, the two main government forces: the Social Democrats, who express the Chancellor, and the Greens, who have two key ministers in this phase, the Economy, in the hands of Robert Habeck, and the Foreigners, led by Annalena Baerbock. If the delays in sending weapons to Ukraine have caused various criticisms toward Scholz and the SPD, on the energy front, as it is easy to imagine, are the Greens to be under observation: for gas supplies, for example, Germany has discussed with Qatar (for which the Greens have long been feeding skepticism).
26296	15	In June, Habeck also launched a plan to restore some coal plants to open for smaller gas supplies. The decision, of course, is the daughter of the contingences, but it is unique that just a green minister is having to take it, especially if we consider that his party was central in anticipating the exit from this fossil source, moving it from 2040 to 2030.
26296	17	Scholz also said that Germany might think of prolonging its nuclear power plants. Currently, the country is in the final phase of a long and gradual process of renunciation to nuclear energy (one of the main political battles of the Greens). According to the plans, 2022 is expected to be the last year of operations of the only three nuclear power plants still in operation, but in recent years many parties have assumed to extend their operations and postpone the final termination.
26296	19	As useful, the measure, if valid, could yet in great part respond to the need to give a signal to both Russia and the German public, in addition to its actual utility. There are, in fact, a number of elements to consider.
26296	21	The three active power plants, for example, produce 6% of the energy used in Germany (from 25% generated by 17 active reactors before the nuclear withdrawal plan): a share not irrelevant, but not even decisive. Furthermore, prolonging the operation of the power plants would mean producing less energy than expected, according to a government report dated March: when the operation of a reactor begins slowly to end due to the lack of unused uranium at the end of its usable life, the production can be artificially extended for a few months by means of plant control measures, but at the cost of less efficiency. For this reason, the report did not recommend an extension of the periods of activity.
26296	23	Similarly, a true suspension of the nuclear output plan would be complicated not only for the technical and bureaucratic times it would require, but also because of the fact that uranium supply could still lead Berlin to look at Moscow. Scholz’s statement could also respond to the logic of being pragmatic and reactive at a time when he and his party are falling in the pleasure surveys, and suffer greatly the growth of the CDU and the high appreciation for Habeck and Baerbock, who have always opposed a nuclear extension and have become more possibilistic only recently.
26296	25	The public opinion, in fact, seems favorable to the measure: at the end of June, 61% of the respondents of an Infratest Dimap survey thought it was right to continue the operation of the still operating centers beyond 2022. According to a recent survey, the percentage would rise to 75 per cent. A fairly distributed judgment between the various elections, and that concerned more than one in two even among those who voted Green in last elections.
26296	27	The energy issue, therefore, is central not only for the German economy and for the freedom of European action against Moscow, but is increasingly a topic of building political consensus in Germany. How long this phase will last, it will depend on a number of factors (first among all, the duration of the conflict), but in this scenario, Green and SPD must prove that they are ready for choices potentially contrary to the government program, and motivated by the situation created by the invasion of Ukraine.
26300	1	“We save the planet together”: we just missed the book-prediction of Greta and the Dalai Lama
26300	3	Rome, 27 lug – There’s little to do: in this period, the environmentalism takes away. And it makes a lot of quattrins. That the Greta Thunberg operation is a purely commercial operation is not a mystery for anyone. After a couple of years of apnea, between a pandemic and a Russian-Ukrainian war, it is then that the iron is going to beat right now that it has returned warm. In fact, the library has just arrived the book Together to Save the Planet: Common Goals Against Climate Change, edited by Baldini and Castoldi. It is a book that has been signed by a strange couple: Greta and the Dalai Lama.
26300	5	Greta and Dalai Lama
26300	6	Of course, the book is not important, but who has written it: those who are actually two influencers. And I’m really sorry to say that, since we’re always talking about a spiritual guide (the Dalai Lama, not the Greta). In terms of content, the topics are the usual of the green arsenal: to safeguard the planet, man must take a step back. And maybe it should be extinguished. The figure of the volume, in fact, is precisely in his misanthropic philosophy: at the basis of this philosophy, wrote Francesco Borgonovo on the Truth, “there is, in the bottom, the dishonesty for the human being. The body is not just a prison from which to disappear as soon as possible, the blessing is in the dissolving of the individual, the illumination only comes when the disappearance from the corruption of the real is completed. In this context, it is not surprising that the most radical environmentalists come to consider man a cancer and to promote its extinction, to desire its annihilation and reduction to organic compound, to immundity (read to believe the texts of the cyberfeminist Donna Haraway)”.
26300	8	The Great Food
26300	9	But there is not just this. It is no coincidence that the book – along with an intervention of the same Greta on the Press – has been released just these days. From 25 to 29 July, the Climate Social Camp, a European summit of all Greek environmentalists, will take place in Turin. The event, of course, is organized on behalf of Fridays for future, the Thunberg factory brand. And – not less importantly – he received a massive contribution from Askatasuna, the famous Torinese social center linked to the violent No Tav and suspected of sovereign activity. It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do.
2631	1	More than 22,000 Ukrainians are placed in Italian schools
2631	3	This demonstrates a total disinterest for the good of Italian children. They are always interested in others.
2631	5	Imagine what they can learn, infiltrated in the schools of a foreign country and the harm they do, involuntaryly, to Italian students.
2631	7	Clothes of Madness. We have nothing against Ukrainian children, but of course they don’t even know Italian. What does it mean to put them in school? To delay the already scarce learning of our students? And since they come from no vax families, they are not a problem?
2631	9	From February 24 to today the Ukrainian students welcomed by the school system are 22.788, of which 5.060 in the childhood school, where there are no places for Italian children so that parents are forced to pay increasingly high fees in private, 10.399 in elementary, 5.226 in average and 2.103 in higher.
2631	11	The delightful report also contains information about territorial distribution: 21% is concentrated in Lombardy, 12% in Emilia-Romagna and 11% in Campania. This is by the Ministry of Non-Education.
2632	1	Migrants, the silent invasion: another 573 landed to Augusta. But the Lamorgese doesn’t move a finger.
2632	3	The landing of migrants on one of our coasts is a certainty. The political agreement on the automatic displacement of the recovered non-Community passengers along the Central Mediterranean route remains a promise. It is an irragungable mirage once again smelled along Augusta, where the reception machine, necessarily oiled to the duty, is continuously in operation. And where, from Monday night, the work of the Italian Rescue Corps of the Order of Malta (Cisom) is not stopped. Coastal Guard participated in the rescue operations of 573 migrants, including 19 accompanied minors, who were on board two fishing vessels 70 miles away from Capo Spartivento. Among them is a salmon.
2632	4	Migrants, this year’s landing bills are already record
2632	6	"Therefore, the bill of landings is updated with them: and as I in the last hours, there are already over four thousand migrants arrived this year in the coast of Italy. For the accuracy, “the clandestines essentially landed in Sicily are: 4701. 3035 in January and 1666 in February. And for the point, the last rescue operation is the one that took place along the calabres coast of Capo Spartivento. Where the Diociotti recovered the 573 passengers who, the Coast Guard explained, were in trouble. “On board of two supermarines. And left in the ball of the waves,"" which after the rescue, they then landed to Augusta. If then we think that not far from Augusta, precisely in Pozzallo, just a few days ago from the Ocean Viking 338 migrants have landed, 35 of whom positive results to the Covid and landed in the Quarantine Ship Azzurra in line, it is clear how the total increases and prelude to the impressive numbers that will be realised with the profusion landings that record every summer season, pandemic or not, regardless of..."
2632	8	In 572 migrants on the ship Diciotti land to Augusta
2632	10	And so, the Naval Unit Diciotti also found its place of attraction on the bank of the port of Augusta. Where the recognition operations are underway, waiting for the appropriate structure to be identified to host them. Cisom’s healthcare providers continue to monitor the health conditions of children. and women. People in difficulty. By providing them with medical care and care of all kinds, “to try to meet the primary needs, keeping them warm with the distribution of wool cover,” they explain from the Cisom. In addition to collaborating with land medical staff in anti-Covid activities. And all of that, down on numbers. And multiplied by an increasing number of arrivals.
2632	11	Meloni: “It is an emergency clandestine immigration. Lamorgese must resign as soon as possible.
2632	13	The number and difficulties that the government’s migratory policy, the EU indifference, and the minister Lamorgese’s inerciality, not only do not arginate. But they even grow to dismisure. Parallelly to a continuous state of emergency, from time to time tamponed here and there, but never resolved. A stall that increases criticism and indignation, on which, still in the last days, Matteo Salvini tweeted: “Other 573 clandestines are coming. More than 4,000 from the beginning of the year. I am undergoing a trial because I stopped the landings. The current minister does not move a finger. Why? » And on which from the opposition Giorgia Meloni emphasized: “Today’s departure: now it is an emergency clandestine immigration. Nothing will change with the minister Lamorgese at Viminale. He must resign as soon as possible.” But even on that front, from the Ministry of the Interior, everything is silent and nothing moves.
2633	1	by Greta Thunberg? They put it in naftaline. I wonder why...
2633	3	The media power creates, the media power destroys. For a while, light the reflectors on you, after a while, you turn them off. Disappear from the scene. At least for a while, waiting for you to return (if it is ever established that you will return) your moment of glory. That’s what happens to Greta Thunberg. It disappeared from the radar.  They don’t talk and they don’t talk about it anymore. Not outside anymore. Don’t throw any more proclamations. What has happened?
2633	5	It happened, brutally said, that it is no longer functional to the great global power, which he had decided until some time ago to massively invest in the green reversion of the industrial apparatus, on zero emissions, on the stop to earth warming. And, for this reason, he had decided to spread a new ecologist apocalyptic, with so many warnings about incumbent disasters, such as the rise of sea levels, the dissolution of artificial ice, the desertification of the South of the world.
2633	7	The prophet of this new ecologist word was, for example, the small and resolved Greta. Each of his injections was followed by millions and millions of followers, direct streaming, first-page titles, and subtle services on the tg.
2633	9	But now it is no longer so. The war in Ukraine has suddenly changed interests and priorities. The West has suddenly awakened by the dream of a world without more fossil fuels, a world of white mules and smiling birds. We will need oil and gas for many years.
2633	11	It is so that Germany, head of the Green transition with the Greens to the government, has decided to suspend the closure of coal plants. Who doesn’t care about the greenhouse effect if Western Europe’s society and industrial apparatus can save something on gas imports as well as secure the energy savings needed to support pile and life. When the economic interests are in the game, the Germans, you know, don’t look in face to anyone.
2633	13	The world’s ecological circles are not looking at and raise the alarm. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The consequences of the Russian war in Ukraine are not only at risk of destroying the global food and energy markets, but they may also undermine the global climate agenda. If the countries respond to Russia’s aggression by increasing their use of fossil fuels, the conflict risks to take us away from achieving global climate goals.”
2633	15	The Apocalypse can wait and Greta Thunberg risks to stay in naftaline for a long time. When her turn comes again, she will be an adult woman, with the ecologism of the “gretins” who will have lost her adolescence. and innocence.
2636	1	Sanctions to the oligarchs, Patriarch Kirill urges the faithful to pray for his portfolio
2636	3	It is an hour of anguish for Patriarch Kirill. In his Sunday sermon in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and Invasor in Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church urged the faithful to pray for him, for the Russians not gay but above all for his portfolio. “In these difficult hours, we are witnessing an extension of NATO to my bank accounts that threatens my estimated wealth between 4 and 8 billion euros. God will punish them. And for God, of course I mean Putin.”
2636	5	The Russian Archbishop then continued, recalling during his preaching the step of Luke 8:25, “It is easier for a camel to pass through the crune of a needle, than an oligarch to enter the kingdom of God.” The message of the Lord is clear and assertive: God warns us because the crunes of our needles are too tight. We thus extend our needles and in general all the tools used to cook! There are countless kinds of needles, of different sizes and shapes, in relation to the use and thickness of the cooking material, but God speaks to each of them so that each of them may rise to the message of the Gospel and extend his crune, thus putting an end to the suffering of the rich! If not, how will the oligarch enter the kingdom of God? It will have to remix through a miniaturizing radius or with the Pym Particles – and of course it can allow it because it’s rich – but it’s a stress. Let’s fight the stress, the enemy that comes from the West!”
2636	7	After this omelia, spoken with blurred eyes, Kirill invited the faithful to generosely donate in the cassettes for the offers in the church, not looking at the fact that the cassette itself is massive gold.
2636	8	Cirillo I was lucky in the 2000s when he was the head of the Moscow Patriarchate’s Foreign Affairs and Iraq was under U.S. embargo. At the time, Russia was supporting Iraq, sending first-need goods: the cigarette trade was entrusted to the Russian Church, which took the tenth and sometimes made the cigarette bottles enter, hiding them in the chapel of the Patriarch of Moscow and of all Russia.
2636	10	Kirill instigated the holy war against the “gay lobby” and the westerns that corrupt the customs of the Russians, blessing the invasion of Ukraine and nuclear missiles. Following its positions, Europe is considering to impose its terrible sanctions and to take targeted actions of significant impact, for example by sabotating the closure of the parquet of its chalet in the canton of Zurich. Ukraine is also thinking to hit the Patriarch, withdrawing the honor of the Order of Jaroslav the Wisdom of the First Class, conferring them in 2013, with the motivation “To think well is not so wise.”
2636	12	According to the metropolitan Hilarion, waiting for the prayers of the devotees to take place, Kirill would still be already at the work to run to the repairs, and to repaint his accounts would have organized a theatrical tour that will take place in the major Russian theaters including the bombed Mariupol, titled “Orsini has righteous” and financed by a newspaper of the always free Russian press, “ejedдневный сумасшедший” (“The Matto Quotidiano”).
2640	1	Calenda wants Hungary out of the EU. But there runs who wins, not who loses.
2640	3	Good for the first. It was definitely more pleased by Carlo Calenda who yesterday backeted Letta for the jewellery with which he had invoked the immediate embargo on Russian gas. “Bravo Enrico, with what do you replace him?” he ironized. It’s strange to believe, but today it’s exactly the leader of Action to jump in the same fire as the secretary of the Pd in commenting on the satisfaction (“just like Putin,” he tweeted) of Giorgia Meloni for Viktor Orban’s victory. “Today Hungary is the fifth column of the Russians, the target of Italian delocalizations, funded by European funds that we also pay. We really don’t understand what we expect to send them out of the EU.” How it runs. And then those tones as the master of the ferries that refer to that corporate vision of the policy so voga in the 1990s, which only in Berlusconi managed to transplant a popular heart.
2640	4	Calenda against Orban and the Melons
2640	6	It is also impossible to claim it to Carletto. He is a left-wing parliamentary intrusive in politics through “Future Italy” by Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, one who claimed to ride the anti-Casta vulgate agitated by the Corriere della Sera with a longer name than a train-merci. They are more able to a diplomatic career than a dismissed leader. He noticed it alone after a dispute in Naples that sent him the pizza of the cross: the Casta was also him. and irremediably. Not by chance it was a counter such as Beppe Grillo to collect the fruits of the tree scrolled from the book of Gian Antonio Stella and Sergio Rizzo. A bitter epilog, never truly archived by Calenda, however, leaves to recycle first as Minister of Renzi (now hated), then as MP (successfully repudiated) and finally, in Action, as an apostle of competence.
2640	8	Elections in Italy are an option.
2640	10	If you were limited to this, it would be perfect. Unfortunately, he has engaged in politics, which is not exactly his vocation. It was proof to the administrations of Rome, when in front of a central right he feared contamination, avoiding the possible victory. But it’s so much: from that world he wants the votes for them free. More, the closer the elections and the more you go back to the left, except to shoot some boundaries to save against the 5 Stars, with which (we bet?) He will soon join. The anti-Meloni sort is in the copy. Orban, who wants to get out of Europe. Without reflecting that the liberal Hungarian Prime Minister governs by winning the elections, not losing them as the companions of the Pd. For instance, a party to throw out of the EU the super-democratic Calenda would find him more looking around than going to look for him on the map.
2642	1	Draghi's reasonable risk: over 50,000 dead since he was Prime Minister
2642	3	You can think it as you want. The numbers tell a clear story: Draghi failed. His health and vaccination policy failed.
2642	5	On February 13, 2021, Draghi took over the government with 13,908 coronavirus-positive. The positive rate was 4.5%. The number of victims was 316.
2642	7	The people recovered in intensive therapy were 2.095, in decline. The recovered with symptoms instead 18.736, in decline.
2642	9	Today, after almost a year of Draghi’s care, the situation is overwhelming. There are almost 400 deaths a day. And we have 19,862 people recovered.
2642	11	The only downward, mild, about 1,700 is that of intensive therapies: but we know how they sweat, with the dead.
2642	12	How long has he been dealing with mandatory vaccines, green pass and the ‘reasonable risk’ policy?
2642	14	On the 13th of February, the pandemic began with 93,356 deaths. With the deaths today we have reached 143,875: Draghi's policy is responsible for 50,519 deaths.
2642	16	This scelled son of Goldman has made almost more deaths than the previous government that, clearly, was found in a sudden situation.
2642	18	In compensation, it doubled the landings last year and started in 2022.
2642	20	He must realize it. It is a government with a criminal migration and health policy.
2643	1	Revanscist Nazism in the West
2643	3	We are watching the return of Nazism, but this time throughout the Western world. Austria, Germany and Italy have eliminated civil freedoms more fully than Hitler and Mussolini had done. Germany, Austria and Italy have destroyed the medical-patient relationship more completely than Josef Mengele has done. The political leaders of this rising Nazism are all guilty of crimes according to the laws of Nuremberg.
2643	5	Will the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Russia again invade these Nazi countries and justify the leaders for their capital crimes? No is. The United States, the United Kingdom, France and Russia [1] are doing the same as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
2643	7	Australia has concentration camps, not for Japanese war prisoners but for Australian citizens suspected of having contact with someone infected with Covid. Everywhere in the “free” western world, officials of the executive branch have shown disregard for the constitutional processes by affirming legislative powers and issuing laws in the form of mandates. Parliaments and Congresses have shown their contempt for democratic political systems by accepting the confiscation of their powers and the incorporation of the legislative function in the executive as it happened in Rome under the Caesars.
2643	9	In the United States, small Nazis are scattered everywhere. Business employers, school councils, university administrators, sports teams owners, hospital administrators, mayor and governors have revealed themselves as many small Fuhrer who issue illegal orders: inject yourself, you and your children, a substance that has been shown not to protect you or anyone else against the Covid or any of its variants, but it is known instead to carry a high risk of serious injuries and death, or you will be released and your career ends. In Germany/Austria re-national people are threatened to prison if they refuse to play Russian roulette with their health. Which government in the past history has been so tyrannical? The West has reached the supreme tyrannia: your health does not depend on you and your doctor. Your health is controlled by a protocol sent by a prison regulatory agency that serves only the profits of Big Pharma.
2643	11	The internal passports of the Soviet Union were seen as the proof of a non-free people. Now the whole western “free” world is faced with internal passports called Covid passports. Once these passports exist, every human right, every civil freedom becomes a right to privilege subject to government approval. All rights are over. Passports are issued to pleasant citizens who, thanks to their service, get privileges to go to restaurants, bars, sports events and other forms of entertainment, to travel and to maintain their workplace.
2643	13	The government is no longer responsible to the citizens; it is the citizens responsible to the government.
2643	15	Freedom is redefined as slavery as in the distopia of George Orwell, 1984.
2643	17	In the U.S. the only people who died of Covid were people with weakened immune system due to comorbility to whom the treatment with safe drugs known as Hydroxyclorocin and Ivermectin was refused which also work as a prevention. To avoid deaths for Covid, all that was needed was to protect the most vulnerable with preventive doses of Hydroclorocin or Ivermectin.
2643	19	Instead, people infected with Covid were buried in houses full of elderly people with immune problems. No one was treated, because the emergency permission given to the so-called “vaccin” provided that there was no known treatment. So Big Pharma and the captured regulatory agencies – FDA, NIH, CDC, WHO – have launched a campaign against hydroxyclorochin and vermectin. It was said that both were dangerous and unapproved (a double lies). False claims were published by the press prostitutes that the hospitals were full of people suffering from ivermectin, presumably a drug for horses. The hospital administrators have accepted the protocol delivered to them by Fauci and Big Pharma that hospitals must prevent any treatment with hydroclorochine and ivermectin regardless of the doctor's orders. The absolutely corrupt American Medical Association has accepted this breach of the medical/patient relationship.
2643	21	When the voice was broken that American hospitals were paid to kill infected patients and not to cure them, family members had to appeal to the court to obtain a court order so that the hospital murder administrators were forced to allow a patient's doctor to save his life with hermectin!
2643	23	The question that desperately requires to be investigated and to have an answer is: who, what agency, under what authority, with what appropriate money has established incentives for American hospitals to kill people to increase their income?
2643	25	This is the biggest crime in American history. The persons responsible for this should be arrested, prosecuted, condemned and justified. Each of them is guilty of mass murder.
2643	27	But nothing will happen, because the media will not allow any truth about the fraud of Covid to be. Whether you believe us or not, the American media is more conditional as a propaganda ministry than the media under Stalin in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet era the media developed the “technique of writing” so that the reader read between the lines. But in the “free” America, where the press is protected by the First Amendment, the decision was made that for the existence of the media the revenue was more important than the truth. Thus, U.S. press, TV and NPR media have become agents for those who have provided them advertising income or subbank profits.
2643	29	Again here are the mortality and survival rates of Covid per age group of untreated Covid infected. The left column is the age mortality rate, the right column is the age survival rate. Remember, to the people who died was prohibited, on the order of Fauci, the treatment with the well-known drugs saved hydroxyclorochin and ivermectin.
2643	31	Clearly, this is not a dangerous pandemic and not one that requires the permanent destruction of a responsible government obtained over the centuries. Fauchs and their evil race have brought the whole western world back to the age of slaves and servants of the land, where no one can speak except the sovereign.
2643	33	Facing the fact that the destruction of Western freedom has been committed by a handful of totalitarian punk with two money such as Fauci, not by statue tyrants such as Stalin and Hitler, reveals how much the West has shaken because of an educational “system” that for decades has challenged every Western conquest and every Western value. Public schools and universities, along with media and Hollywood, prepare the American people for the loss of their freedom.
2643	35	Think about us. How many relatives and ex-friends you have that, if you are not “vaccinated”, they will have nothing to do with you, that they tell you that you are selfish and don’t worry about others, that you risk exposing others to death and harm so that you are not vaccinated. This is Big Pharma’s narrative and your former friends and relatives believe in Big Pharma’s selfish and profitable lies and are immune to known and published facts with which you try, without success, to inform them.
2643	37	People who are unable to think with their own heads – the majority of the population – easily suffer brainwashing and indottrining. It is not a people who can defend their freedom or impose a responsible government. It is a dirty population that revolves against those who would want to restore their freedom, not against those who deprived it of their freedom.
2643	39	However, those few brave – border doctors, Covid ethics doctors, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and thousands of independent doctors and scientists (those who have not received subsidies from Big Pharma) – who defend freedom do so because it is freedom that they are defending. They are defending a human enterprise – the work of a few people – which took centuries from Alfredo the Great in the 9th century to the Glorious Revolution in 1680. The fact that today’s young people have never heard of Alfredo the Great or of the Glorious Revolution shows how education has completely eliminated the achievements of Western History. America, the whole Western world, no longer has an incultured population in the Western values.
2643	41	It was this human conquest – a responsible government – to which the Founder Fathers of the United States responded with the demands of the Declaration of Independence and the protections of the United States Constitution.
2643	43	The discreditation of these fundamental documents has been the primary function of American education for decades. Today we see the result: the American people, as well as those of the Western world, have sold their freedom for a “vaccin” that hates health and kills but does not protect from Covid.
2645	1	EU Plans to Increase Immigration
2645	3	Hungary is launching a new anti-immigrant media campaign targeting George Soros and EU Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker, accused of promoting illegal immigration.
2645	5	The Facebook page of the government of Budapest explains that the campaign includes manifestations with the images of the apolide billionaire Soros and a Juncker smiling above the words “You also have the right to know what Brussels is preparing.”
2645	6	“They want to introduce mandatory reception quotas, weaken the right of Member States to border defence, and facilitate immigration with migrants’ visas,” he said.
2645	8	Viktor Orban’s government, which has often met with the EU on migration, has already undertaken similar campaigns in the past, including “Ferm Brussels” and “Don’t let Soros laugh for the last.”
2645	10	In recent years, Orban has described the 88-year-old apolide speculator as “public enemy” because he supports an uncontrolled mass immigration.
2645	12	“Bruxelles continues to support illegal immigration,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in Budapest. “The Hungarians must know it and that’s why the last information campaign has been launched,” he added, denying that it is part of the campaign for the next European Parliament elections.
2645	14	According to Kovacs, in the “Brussels cassettes” there are plans to increase funding to NGOs and to create a special fund for migrants.
2647	1	Europe releases Scholz before it’s too late
2647	3	We wrote a few days ago that Europe has a chance to continue to rely on the international shaker only if it agrees to rely on Macron. It is the merit of the French president, of course, but “merit” above all of the incredible weakness of Olaf Scholz, the most impalpable German chancellor of the times of the Republic of Weimar.
2647	5	Since the birth of the CEE we have been used to seeing Germany impose on Europe, alone or with the help of France, the most important economic and diplomatic choices. But since Angela Merkel left the power something has disappeared: Scholz seems unable to make any decision. In the last two weeks he remained silent in front of all the major questions that had been asked by the press and colleagues: did he not know how to explain what he intends to do on the Stability Pact (will it change or not?On the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline (is it blocked or not?) Do we send weapons to Ukraine or not?and
2647	7	His pathetic attempt to “take time” in waiting for the problems to be solved alone allowed Macron, one who doesn’t waste some time occupying the spaces left free by others, to take the command of the European caravan. Regardless of whether or not, on key topics such as energy supply, the solution of the Ukrainian crisis and the relations with other superpowers, the European Union is intended to speak French.
2647	9	According to the prestigious newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, Scholz’s indolence “is damaging transatlantic relations more than Trump has ever done,” commenting acidely that “when the American president does more to prevent a war in Europe than the German Chancellor, there is something that’s wrong in German foreign policy.”
2647	11	It is true that Scholz’s weakness is first and foremost the daughter of Angela Merkel’s disseminated policies, who delivered the hands and feet of Germany to Russia and China, two authoritarian countries rejected by unmovible regimes. In the case of Russia, the subordination is due to the construction of the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline, which connects the two countries directly through the Baltic Sea and makes Germany fully dependent on the supplies of Moscow. In the case of China, the fact that in these years Germany has struck strongly on exports to the Chinese market, leaving much of its GDP to depend on the Chinese will to buy goods made in Germany. So now Scholz knows that he cannot move against the two countries without risks of painful retortions.
2647	13	It is not enough: according to the specialized website Politico some EU officials and diplomats would admit that Berlin has even worked in the shadow to prevent the definition of a common European position against China. Scholz’s office feared that the EU itself would “defence too much” Lithuania against Beijing’s economic coercion, so that the chancellor’s headquarters would take dozens of phone calls to all those who speak German in the Commission to mitigate the pressure on Beijing as much as possible, opposing, among other things, the hard line of Paris. Obviously that Lithuania is a member state of the EU does not appear to Scholz sufficient reason to defend it against a brutal dictatorship.
2647	15	It must be repeated: if this is the quality of leadership that Berlin can offer well, Draghi has made it bind to the French with the Quirinal Pact. For charity, Macron is not De Gasperi and is afflicted by the usual mania of greatness so common, but at least he has an idea of Europe a little more articulated than that of Scholz, which seems more and more a end by chance to cover what it is (was?) It is the main task of the continent.
2648	1	"Putin's counsel warns ""global dizziness"" by the end of this year"
2648	3	One of the main assistants of Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that a “global dizziness” could begin by the end of 2022, due to the grain deficiency due to the conflict in Ukraine.
2648	5	“It is important that in the conditions, for example, of a global hunger that will occur by autumn, by the end of this year worldwide, Russia is not going to suffer, but is completely supplied with food,” said Maxim Oreshkin, Putin’s adviser, at a forum in Moscow last week, according to state media Rt.
2648	7	Oreshkin said that hunger will be, in part, caused by the U.S. monetary policy. “From around 2020, grain prices on the world market were stable, but as a result of the rise in the dollar print, which began around July 2020, prices began to rise suddenly,” he said, referring to Washington’s measures to cope with the effect of the lockdown policies. “In fact, what America is trying to do now with Ukraine is to eliminate the grain reserves that Ukraine currently has in its possession, which is only the last action that condemns Ukraine to serious humanitarian problems, and also condemns the global community to have serious hunger problems.”
2648	9	The press agency Afp reports that in the meantime, according to Oreshkin, Russia has actively prepared itself for a possible grain deficiency: “Russia is actively preparing itself for a global hunger; everything has begun at the end of last year.”
2648	11	However, last week U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the United Nations Security Council accused Moscow of blocking Ukrainian ports with war ships, accusing Russia of using food as a war weapon: “It seems that the Russian government thinks that using food as a weapon will help to realize what its invasion has failed to do: [...] break the spirit of the Ukrainian people. As a result of the actions of the Russian government, about 20 million tons of grain remains unused in the Ukrainian silos.” Last week, grain prices reached a historic high after India, the world’s second-largest grain producer, said it would block grain exports. After the announcement of India, on May 16, the price of the futures on grain increased by 5.9%, touching the historic maximum of $12.68 per bushel.
2648	13	Both Russia and Ukraine, in the meantime, account for about a third of the total grain supply. Ukraine is also a major exporter of orange, corn, silk oil and canola oil.
2648	15	Blinken also rejected Russian claims that U.S. economic sanctions against Russia were responsible for the rise of prices: “The sanctions imposed by the U.S. and many other countries deliberately include food, fertilizers and seeds exemptions from Russia. The decision to arm food is only of Moscow.”
2649	1	Turkey doesn’t want “terrorist supporters” in NATO
2649	3	Sweden and Finland have not yet responded to Ankara's security demands, Erdogan said.
2649	5	Turkey will not approve Finland and Sweden’s NATO membership requests until they adequately address Ankara’s concerns about their alleged support to terrorist organizations, Erdogan said, promising not to repeat “the mistakes of the past.”
2649	7	“As long as Tayyip Erdogan will be the head of the Republic of Turkey, we will not be able to say ‘yes’ to the entry into the NATO of countries that support terrorism,” the Turkish leader told reporters returning from a trip to Azerbaijan, according to what was on Sunday, May 29, by state media.
2649	9	The delegations of Sweden and Finland met with their Turkish counterparts in Ankara for a conversation last week, following the joint request of the northern countries to join the U.S.-led military alliance. Despite the meeting, the Ankara government has again threatened to block the process unless the two countries make a life round on the groups they consider extremists.
2649	11	“I’m not honest and honest,” Erdogan said about the results of the talks. “They do not take the necessary measures, they continue to allow terrorists to walk freely on the streets of Stockholm and provide them with security with their police.” “We can’t repeat the same mistake made in the past against these countries that host and feed the terrorists,” Erdogan added, referring to the long faeda with Athens on Cyprus, and reminding how in 1980 Ankara allowed Greece to return after its partial withdrawal from NATO.
2649	13	NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has previously recognised that it is unlikely that Finland and Sweden become NATO members if they do not meet Turkey’s demands. “No country has suffered as much terrorist attacks as Turkey,” Stoltenberg said on Thursday, adding that Turkey is a “important ally and when an ally has concerns should be discussed and the problem solved.”
2649	15	We remember that the membership of the two Nordic Countries Alliance requires the unanimous consent of all 30 Member States and Turkey has threatened to block the process unless Finland and Sweden make a life round on the groups that Ankara considers extremists.
2650	1	Johnson’s stretch of hand to bin Salman... the “moral” lesson!
2650	3	In Saudi Arabia, various sectors of public opinion have expressed a moral “no” to Britain saying: “Johnson’s stretch of hand with an autocrat who has just committed a mass murder” means that “Great Britain is ready to make an agreement with the devil to reduce its dependence on Russian gas.
2650	5	The article published yesterday by the newspaper and written by the director of the legal charity agency, Reprieve, which traces serious human rights violations, indicated that Boris Johnson’s visit to Saudi Arabia came after the Gulf Kingdom justified 81 men a few days ago, asking: does Johnson not understand the public opinion in Britain well? Or have things changed after the Russian war against Ukraine?
2650	7	Although the writer has stated that “Johnson’s stretch of hand with an autocrat who had just chaired a mass murder would damage Britain’s moral position on the world scene,” she explained that “in the weeks following the Russian forces invaded Ukraine, there was the feeling that the calculation has changed. More and more conservatory ministers say that the government should do everything possible to reduce Britain’s dependence on Russian gas and that it should make a deal with the devil, said Mark Almond, director of the Institute for Crisis Research.
2650	9	Writer Maya Foa said that “from Jamal Khashoggi was attracted to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 and murdered, Western leaders have mostly gone away from the kingdom, avoiding taking photos with the hereditary prince.”
2650	11	Foa said that “the timing of the execution is scary. Less than two weeks ago, The Atlantic published a long interview with the hereditary prince promoting complete updates to the Saudi criminal justice system.
2650	13	He added that, visiting Saudi Arabia, “Johnson confirms that Saudi authorities can kill who they want, at any time, and the West will ignore it.”
2650	15	“The Saudi Kingdom effectively ensures that more people will be justified whose only crime was challenging the status quo,” he said. People like Hassan al-Maliki, a religious who is currently risking death penalty for the contents of his library.”
2650	17	Foa explained: “Saudi justice is a black box of which we can never be sure. The Saudi European Human Rights Organization, whichins a complete record of the executions in Saudi Arabia, did not know even 69 cases (of 81 that were justified). These men have been prosecuted, condemned and justified in complete secret.”
2650	19	“On the 12 we know, it is likely that at least three of them have been tortured to make false confessions of terrorist crimes after taking part in demonstrations for democracy,” he said.
2650	21	He said that while “the authorities describe the men justified as terrorists, there are political prisoners, nonviolent drug crimes and people who have been arrested by children in the arm of death. “
2650	23	In 2014, the British and Saudi governments signed a memorandum of agreement on judicial cooperation.
2650	25	“My organization, Reprieve, has filed a request based on the right to information, but it has been rejected as the dissemination of information could have a negative impact on the effective management of international relations,” the author said. Because of this secret, we don’t know if the British assistance has supported a justice system based on torture and executions in Saudi Arabia.”
2650	27	He added: “What we know from the reports of the European-Saudi Human Rights Organization and the media monitoring is that during the period in which this agreement was implemented, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has significantly increased the frequency of execution, so so so so there have been more than 900 cases since 2015. Only in January the British Justice Minister, Dominic Raab, met with his counterpart, the Sheikh Walid Al-Samaani, and said he was happy to know the progress of Saudi Arabia in the judicial reform and human rights. He was considered a fool.”
2650	29	“The Prime Minister’s trip to Riyadh, shortly after this mass execution, is a shame for him personally and for Britain,” said Maya Foa. No one in his narrow circle would tell him that there are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than to encourage and enable a murderous system?
2650	31	Here we have to say that the West, which has shown us to be racist when it has distinguished between Ukrainian refugees and refugees from Asia and Africa. The Netherlands also expelled Syrian refugees and welcomed with enthusiasm the Ukrainians with white hair and blue eyes, as described by the Western press, as well as the moral claims of Britain. His Prime Minister meets bin Salman and stretches his hand with the blood of people who did nothing but asking for something like equality and democracy, this is the moral reputation of the West.
2666	1	The war against non-vaccinated people will not be forgotten.
2666	3	If you have refused to accept the official narrative about Covid vaccines, you’ve probably suffered hateful attacks and waste. Some of these fanatics may now realize they are wrong, but few want to talk about it. How do you choose to move forward?
2666	5	Encouraging hatred is a tool of the tyrants and, over the past two years, political leaders, agency directors, academics, medical professionals and media personalities have publicly encouraged hatred and violence and wished a painful death to anyone who didn’t want to be part of that medical experiment that are the Covid vaccines.
2666	7	In an eloquent post on Medium, journalist Susan Dunham summarizes the lessons (hope) learned from hatred and attack on non-vaccinated (1):
2666	9	    “The obligations have been relieved, and both sides have returned to jump into something that resembles the old normality – except for the fact that there is a new and current wound injury to the people we have tried to break. No one wants to talk about it.
2666	11	    Just a few weeks ago, our leaders themselves admitted that they wanted to make the lives of non-vaccinated unliveable. And as a delegated collective, we multiplied the pain, bringing the struggle to our families, friendship and workplaces. Today we face the hard truth that nothing of all this was justified and, in doing so, we discover a precious lesson.
2666	13	    It has been a rapid breakdown from righteousness to cruelty and, as far as we can shame our leaders for the push, we are responsible for falling into the trap despite the best judgment.
2666	15	    We knew that the decline of immunity puts a large number of vaccinated people on the same plan and a growing minority demands non-vaccinated people, yet we have marked them for a special persecution. We said they didn’t “do the right thing” turning their back to the state care, even though we knew that opposition in principle to something like this has no price in any circumstances...
2666	17	    And so it has been that, thanks to the deliberate ignorance of science, civic education and politics, we have oppressed the non-vaccinated to the point that we have done it... We cannot hold the head up, as if we believe we have logic, love or truth from our side while we blessingly wish death to the non-vaccinated. The best thing we can do is to sit in the consciousness of our wicked unhumanity because we have marginalized so many people.
2666	19	    Contrasting them was a tremendous shame for many of us, who now have understood that obligations had only the power that we gave them. It was not thanks to a quiet aquiescence that we avoided the infinite domination of pharmaceutical companies and medical checks leads to the door.
2666	21	    It was thanks to the people we tried to destroy... We hugged the ego hating them, but their perseverance gave us the time to understand that we were wrong. Now it seems that obligations will return, but this time there is the hope that many of us see them for what they are: an increasing authoritarianism that doesn’t worry about our well-being.”
2666	23	To forgive and forget.
2666	25	Dunham faces the situation from the point of view of those who are falling out of the hypnotic command of disregarding anyone – friends and family members including – refused to believe the official narration of the Covid vaccines. However, most of you have probably been the victim of these attacks.
2666	27	How did you choose to deal with them? What did you learn? I suspect that many of you are willing to forgive, but few will never forget those betrayals. But as Dunham noted, no one really wants to talk about what has been done.
2666	29	Everyone goes ahead as if it had never happened. As if our leaders did not ask for our death. As if our president had not warned us that his patience with us was “exhausting” (2) – a threat that implicated that bad things would happen once patience was exhausted. As if telegraph managers like Don Lemon had not said that we deserved to die of hunger and that we’t have to enter a food store (3), (4). But these things told her, and family and friends rejected us as a result.
2668	1	Zelensky's Holograms: War Plays Us In The Future
2668	3	That war and technological development travel along the way is what is now almost known to everyone, and similar speech can be made thinking of the binomial war and propaganda. But what has not yet had a clear connection was the relationship between technological development and propaganda.
2668	5	Certainly, any new creation to be sold to the public always passes for its advertising before the launch on the market but, so far, hardly remember in recent history events so wipedly aimed at sliding the technology with the propaganda of war, going beyond then the simple advertising as so far we have understood in the world of consumption.
2668	7	Today it happens that, after the tour of the various national parliaments and the appearances here and there, the Zelensky phenomenon also arrives at the various tech festivals that are taking place or recently ended in various European capitals. And what better way to do it than through a hologram.
2668	9	You have understood well, as the source article reports, also retrieved from the Italian site drcommodore.it, Zelensky's holograms appeared at the VivaTech fair in Paris, the Brilliant Minds in Stockholm, the Founders Forum in London and the Next Web in Amsterdam, and in all cases the copy was the same.
2668	11	The President of Ukraine, now true star of the Western plague, has once again asked for help to defeat Russian enemies, but in this case he is not addressed to governments but to private citizens. And to encourage them to invest money in the Ukrainian case here is the encouraging offer: invest in Ukraine and you will be the promoters of an experiment aimed at the creation of the first digital government (on the face of the Ukrainians who are willing to die for European values as von der Leyen says).
2668	13	    “No other country in the world will offer you such a delightful opportunity to try the most advanced technologies at state level. It is an experiment, a digital revolution and at the same time a modernization of the current system.”
2668	15	    – announced one of Zelensky’s holograms
2668	17	This is why a simple war is revealed spudorously for what it really is: an experiment...not only social to test the reaction of European peoples to the sacrifice in the name of the defense of Ukraine, not only military to test on the field new weapons, including new drones et similia, not only political to see what happens if one becomes a comic a politician and then an influencer, but also – and at this point above all, seen the incomplete digital/virtual/green-technological revolution.
2668	19	What will happen to Ukraine is not yet clear, so many different and overwhelming interests contain that portion of territory, like rabbious dogs that contain a piece of meat. What is certain is that linking pandemic and war there is an increasingly visible lead thread, aimed at a complete transformation of the Western lifestyle. Sadly, the majority of people instead of looking for this thread, suffer to look at Zelensky's holograms.
2679	1	China, Communist indottrination never dies: Xi Jinping becomes elementary school subject
2679	3	Communists are like the wolves of the proverbs: they change the hair, but not the visio. It’s emblematic what’s happening in China, where his president Xi Jinping’s unique communist thought comes to primary schools.
2679	5	Xi Jinping’s thought ends even in primary schools. It will actually enter the school curricula throughout China to strengthen the “marxist” and “patriotical” approach to national education.
2679	7	From Mao's Red Book to Xi Jinping's Thought
2679	9	The Ministry of Education has drawn a “guide” to the teaching materials for the study courses on the Chinese President’s thought. “The ideological system of socialism with Chinese characteristics of Xi Jinping in the new era is rigorous, logical, rich in broad and deep connotations,” said Tian Huisheng, director of the ministry’s textbooks office, cited in a note broadcast by Chinese media, and it is “necessary to fully and accurately understand the essence of the Chinese leader’s thoughts about socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.”
2679	11	The thought of the leader of the Beijing regime, who is also the Secretary-General of the Communist Party in China, will have to be introduced in all courses, from primary to university. Xi’s thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era entered the Chinese Constitution in 2018, at the beginning of his second term as president, and at the end of a consolidation process of Xi at the summit of power culminated with the elimination of the bond of the double term to the leadership of the state, which opened the way to his indefinite leadership.
2679	13	Chinese President Closed the Binding Of The Two Mandates
2679	15	Xi Jinping, 68 years old, a graduate in chemical engineering, since 2018 has imposed changes to the Constitution that will allow him as president of the People's Republic to exceed the limit of the two mandates (two years in total) that was introduced in 1982, as a response to the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, imputed to the indiscusive authority of Mao Tse-tung. The highest duty of the state is Xi Jinping, who at the same time exercises the role of secretary of the party. He has been president of the People's Republic of China since March 14, 2013.
2684	1	"The Nato's lies implod... The Kiev regime was told: ""Pay the price for peace."""
2684	3	The lasting harm of the fatistic lies is the erosion of the alleged leadership by the United States and NATO complaints.
2684	5	The Biden administration, the Western media (i.e. the propaganda system) and the NATO military axis are in a frontal confrontation with reality. A first signal is the alert of aggressive attitude and their small Kiev regime was urged to reduce losses and make an agreement with Russia.
2684	7	In the last four months since Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine, the Western public has been filled with uninterrupted lies about the “legal aggression” of Moscow, about how Russia itself was losing the war due to the “defense heroes” and about how NATO itself was supporting inviolate principles of Ukrainian sovereignty that somehow “justified” the flood of weapons in the country.
2684	9	Now Jens Stoltenberg, the civil leader of the U.S.-led transatlantic alliance, is temporarily throwing out a white flag to bring to the inevitable reality. Speaking at a conference in Finland last weekend, Stoltenberg urged the Kiev regime to “pay the price of peace” by giving territory claims to Russia. The former Norwegian Prime Minister, as a comic wooden statue it is, is undoubtedly used as a spokesman for more strategic planners in the transatlantic establishment.
2684	11	The “Peace Prize” would involve the recognition by the Ukrainian authorities of the Crimea Peninsula as part of the Russian Federation and the independence of the Donbass Republics. The Russian invasion of Ukraine started on February 24 was launched to defend those Russian-speaking territories from the offensive of the NATO-backed Kiev regime and its Nazi battles.
2684	13	This marks a surprising backfront from the NATO blockade. Since the CIA-sponsored coup in Kiev in 2014 and the Crimea's secesion to become part of the Russian Federation, Moscow has been continuously diffamated by allegedly annexing the peninsula as the United States and its EU allies have accumulated round after round of economic sanctions.
2684	15	The alleged restoration of Ukraine’s “territorial integrity” was a recurring reason for the growing hostility of the NATO axis led by the United States against Russia. Now, however, the head of the NATO blockade is telling the Kiev regime that it is better to prepare to surrender the territory for the sake of peace. This is about the principle! And what was the purpose of all these years of growing economic sanctions against Russia on Crimea?
2684	17	The change of thought reflects the emerging reality that the Russian military intervention in Ukraine is actually revealing a success. Moscow has secure the Russian-speaking regions and seriously damaged the Ukrainian army infested by the Nazis. The idea that Ukraine will join NATO is also out of question.
2684	19	Just a few weeks ago, the Western governments and their respected media were full of claims that Russia was facing a strategic defeat by the Ukrainian armed forces by NATO. U.S. President Joe Biden and his Secretary of State Antony Blinken showed security of this.
2684	20	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his highest foreign diplomat, Liz Truss. What will they say now?
2684	22	The Nazi nature of the Ukrainian forces was covered by stories of “heroes defenders.” When Russia consolidated its fighting power in eastern Ukraine to take over the Donbass, the Western media readily this as a withdrawal. On the contrary, several independent military analysts and sources on the field were giving a opposite and more accurate point of view, claiming that the Russian forces and their Donbass allies were doing exactly what they had planned to do: liberating the Russian-speaking territory.
2684	24	Now that Russia is on the right way to its goals, the western propaganda narrative is shrinking because of the lies on which it has always been built.
2684	26	There will be a lot of toothbrush for the failure of the final propaganda. The debacle in Afghanistan will look like a barracle of this epic failure. Hundreds of billions of dollars and euros of US and NATO weapons sent to Ukraine did nothing to “defence” the country. It was a manna for the military-industrial complex and its political mercenaries. But the wave of weapons did not prevent Russia from achieving its goals.
2684	28	The global economic impacts of the conflict – completely avoidable if the United States and their NATO partners were diplomatically engaged with Russia to solve Moscow’s long-standing security problems – hit the Western states with a revenge. The rise in prices and energy bills is seriously damaging millions of workers who see the economic disaster not as the fault of Russia (the so-called “Putin’s rise in prices”) but as a result of the geopolitical games of Washington and Brussels and the elite indifference. This is just another aspect of reality – one of the enormous implications of an unprecedented social disruption – which is forcing the Western ruling class to save the disaster in Ukraine.
2684	30	The frontal confrontation with reality will create explosive reactions. The Western powers are already moving Kiev towards the acceptance of its fate as a redundancy. Stoltenberg’s advice to “pay a price for peace” is the opening of Kiev to which it is said to become real and to reduce its losses. The Western public will rightly see through this opportunity and the total lack of scruples and will wonder what was all the false drama and the ridiculous expenses funded by taxpayers. A angry counterfeit is coming to the charlatans in charge.
2684	32	We can wait for the Western media to start searching for spiders to “explain” Russia’s success. It indicates reports like this recent New York Times that blames Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky for tactical errors. But the unbearable victimism of the Kiev regime and its exaggerated comic becoming president will undoubtedly rage and double with impossible demands of “defense” of the U.S. and NATO. Zelensky has a talent to name and shame the perceived lack of indulgence. He was prepared to work in this way and his status as a Western celebrity gives him a false sense of importance.
2684	34	The story is spread by CIA-sponsored pupacks who survive to their utility and are then removed as a rubbish. If Zelensky and his whisper are angry not playing the ball with the United States and their NATO partners who are trying to hide their lies, i.e. not accepting his role as a spyware, then Zelensky will have to face a more energic “pension plan”.
2684	36	But in the end the last damage to the lies is the erosion of the alleged leadership by the United States and NATO complaints. Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the U.S. claims, calling them “the empire of lies.” It is an objective fate.
2685	1	Austria, Kurz: “We don’t welcome Afghan refugees, we have too many. “Illegal immigration”
2685	3	We will not welcome any Afghan in our country, not under my power.” For Sebastian Kurz, the 2015 refugee policy cannot be the solution, neither for Kabul nor for the European Union. And even facing a humanitarian emergency like that in Afghanistan, the Austrian Chancellor says, in an interview with the Press, that “our position is realistic: the integration of the Afghan is very difficult and requires an energy expenditure that we cannot afford.”
2685	4	The no of Austria to Afghan refugees
2685	6	With more than 44,000 Afghan entering our country in these years, Austria is already home to the fourth largest Afghan community in the world, if we consider the distribution of migrants by number of inhabitants. There are much more Afghan refugees living with us, than those who have taken Italy or other EU states. Only this year, approximately 8,000 refugees, including a fifth from Kabul, have arrived from us through the Balkan route still open.”
2685	8	The difficulty of Afghan integration, according to Kurz, is in the first place in “the level of education, mostly low and divergent in the fundamental values. Let’s think carefully about this: more than half of the young Afghan people already living in Austria, for example, support violence in the event that their religion is overwhelmed. So when we say we’re not solidarity, that’s not true. We are focusing on supporting neighboring countries to Afghanistan, to provide protection and assistance to the Afghan in the region. The dramatic developments in Kabul got everyone surprised. Now we have to make massive pressure on the Taliban so that they continue to respect women’s rights and human rights. The progress made in the last 20 years should not be cancelled. The EU can and wants to exercise pressure together with its international partners. Furthermore, he should focus on supporting the neighboring states to take care of the refugees and the fight against Islamic terrorism, especially ISIS-K.”
2685	10	Austrian Chancellor Kurz: “It’s enough with illegal immigration”
2685	12	It is now clear to all European governments that illegal immigration must be combated and the external borders of Europe must be made secure. We do not have to repeat in any way the mistakes of 2015: the unlimited entry. Even because the conditions compared to then have changed in various parts of the world. We have continued this line for years, but now many other countries see it like us. Countries governed by social-democrats like Sweden and Denmark are also pursuing a restrictive immigration policy. In order that there are no more flows as six years ago, we must break the business model of human traffickers, stop irregular migrants at external borders and return them to their country of origin or to safe third countries.”
2685	14	On the hypothesis of the creation of a common European defence, Kurz says that “Austria is a small neutral country in the heart of Europe, but we participate in the Union’s foreign and security policy, the defence projects Psdc and Pesc, which must be further implemented. We also make a disproportionate contribution to peace missions, for example in the Western Balkans, in Mali or in Lebanon. Instead, the proposal of the German Chancellor candidate, Armin Laschet, from a European FBI deserves a careful consideration: Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, in Berlin, Paris, Nice or Vienna, have clearly demonstrated that Europe must collaborate even more in the fight against Islamic terrorism.”
2689	1	Women, Elderly and Children Violated: Immigrants Out of Control
2689	3	It was recently passed the morning of August 9, 2021, when a 26-year-old woman was surprised by her back, dragged by a arm and raped in the water pipeline of a plant in Cascina Gobba, two steps from the San Raffaele hospital, by a 31-year-old Egyptian without regular residence permit. On the 6th of December, a young pendler was attacked on the train Milan-Varese by two boys little more than twenty years old. The first, who would do “palo”, is an Italian citizen with toxic addiction problems; the other – the material executor of the attempted rape – is a Moroccan with police predecessors and irregular on Italian territory. And then the horror of the night of San Silvestro: dozens of girls are harassed by a gang of foreigners two-step from the Duomo of Milan during the celebrations for the beginning of the new year.
2689	5	“The Istat data speak clearly: foreigners are responsible five times more than the Italians for crimes of sexual violence – said Advisor Riccardo De Corato – Despite the imposition of penalties, harassment and rape are not decreasing. The policies in favour of women’s respect appear not to have taken on a part of the foreign population – and the very serious episode that took place on the New Year’s Eve in Square Duomo confirms it – that continues to consider women as an object, a property of which man can do what he wants.”
2689	7	“Please stop.” That desperate scream, then the horror of the clandestine:
2689	9	On June 2, several teenagers were inflicted with shock harassment on the train to Peschiera when they returned from a morning spent on Lake Garda. The responsible, not all yet identified, would have addressed racist insults to the young victims: “You are white, here (on the train) you don’t have to stay.” A worrying phenomenon, which makes a negative record in Lombardy, that relating to sexual assault.
2689	11	“In our capital (Milano ndr) the trend in recent years has never seen a decline, unfortunately – adds De Corato – Anzi is in slight growth since from 273 cases in 2011 it has passed to 285 cases in 2021. I think the situation is very worrying.”
2690	1	Italy remains the only country to impose the use of machinery
2690	3	Almost 30 months after the start of the pandemic and despite the declared end of the state of emergency, Italy remains almost the only country to still impose the use of masks in some places, including the school, despite the distancing imposed and strictly respected by the children at the bank. Beyond the environmental impact, it is necessary to seriously evaluate its usefulness and potential harmful effects to the health of those who wear it.
2690	5	In a study published in May 2020, Dr. Alberto Donzelli had critically analyzed the RCT in a previous systematic review to assess the effectiveness of medical machinery in the prevention of respiratory infections in university/community contexts and outdoor assemblies. The study also highlighted the possible side effects resulting from prolonged and incorrect use of masks:
2690	7	“There are certain, multiple and underestimated dermatological risks, up to injury that can constitute other entrance doors of pathogens. In fact, in unconscious infected subjects, in which the emission of viruses is maximum in the two days before the symptoms (which may not even appear at all!The mask obliges to a continuous respiratory recirculation of its viruses, adding resistance to saltion, with concrete risk of pushing deep into the alveols a high viral load, which could be defeated by the inherent defences if it had only touched with the upper respiratory pathways, well provided with IgA and IgG already ready.”
2690	9	Why is it still today that this device is overly used to stop the transmission and why does the government still impose its use, without taking into account the negative and harmful aspects? What do we know more today than that study of May 2020 and the many randomized controlled studies carried out before and during the pandemic that still justifies the duration of this anomaly (now once) all Italian?
2690	11	To the many already existing, several interesting new studies have been added that highlight the damages caused by the females; only to mention some of them:
2690	13	   Is a Mask that covers the mouth and nose free from unwanted side effects in everyday use and free of potential hazards? Referring to 44 experimental studies and 65 publications to conclude that the prolonged use of maskerine generates significant effects and consequences under various medical aspects.
2690	14	   - Experimental Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Content in Inhaled Air With or Without Face Masks in Healthy Children: A Randomized Clinical Trial in which it highlights how any type of masks cause in children an increase in carbon dioxide above the limits now considered acceptable.
2690	15	   Correlation Between Mask Compliance and COVID-19 Outcomes in Europe “Al no cause-effect conclusion can be deducted from this observational analysis – conclude the study’s authors – the lack of negative correlations between the use of the mask and the cases and deaths of Covid-19 suggests that the widespread use of the mask at a time when the most effective intervention was needed, i.e. during the strong autumn-winter 2020-2021 peak, was not able to reduce the incidence. Moreover, the moderate positive correlation between the use of the mask and the deaths in Western Europe also suggests that the universal use of the harmful consequences.”
2690	17	But a brilliant comparative work was exposed in a recent article by the Brownstone Institute that concluded that masks, surgical or drug, have no impact on control of the transmission of the Covid-19 virus. In the article there are 167 studies under review and in light of which it can be stated that the evidence shows how such a device is not only ineffective for the purpose of controlling the virus, but it is harmful, especially on children.
2690	19	On what scientific basis then the Government still builds its directives?
2690	21	We hope more and more that all of the above studies are seriously taken into consideration, that we stop hiding behind the repeated refrain “protect the fragile” health measures that health care are not, but deletery.
2690	23	We hope that the impact for a child who still has to wear a mask at school will be assessed in its complexity and therefore also from a psychological and educational point of view.
2690	25	We hope that people will finally be able to get rid of this harmful device, which has now become merely a symbol of terror, but in fact useless for a real, healthy and effective protection.
