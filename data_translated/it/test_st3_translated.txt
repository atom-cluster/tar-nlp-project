361	1	Moscow's shock after Ukraine's counteroffensive
361	3	Even the Ukrainians did not hope so much. In less than a week, the army of Kiev has recovered three thousand square kilometers of territories that were under the control of the Russian army, in northeastern Ukraine, near the great city of Charkiv. The counter-offensive of Ukraine has surprised the Russians and is a turning point of the war, although it would be better to avoid bringing fraudulent conclusions. It is the second major Russian military failure in this campaign of Ukraine, after that of Kiev at the beginning of the invasion.
361	5	The Ukrainian success in this case is doubled. First of all, it is psychological, with an innumerable series of videos in which the Ukrainian flag falls down again on the recovered communes. It is a great blow to the morality of a state in war for 200 days and that is making enormous sacrifices.
361	7	The success is military. The videos appreciate the impressive amount of Russian material abandoned or destroyed, even in the city of Izyum, a regional logistics center where the deposits full of ammunition coins are finished in the hands of the Ukrainians. The Russians did not even have the time to destroy them during the escape. The images also show many documents that will be analyzed by the Ukrainian intelligence services and without a doubt even by the Western ones.
361	9	Abandoning positions
361	11	How to explain this success? The determination of the Ukrainian forces is known. But to highlight, again, are the disorganization and unpreparation of the Russian army.
361	13	How is it possible that an army equipped with satellites, drones and informers did not notice that the Ukrainians were gathering troops and blinds for their counteroffensive? How is it possible that the Russians have found themselves without another choice other than that of retreat without opposition to a real resistance?
361	15	The President of the Russian Federation has decided to react, which he has not yet done.
361	17	The major state of Moscow recognized the abandonment of the positions, but presented it as a consequence of the grouping of its forces. The Ukrainians, by their way, speak of escape in the panic of the Russian soldiers, who would have even abandoned food waste. Some Russian soldiers would have fled by bicycles to not serve as targets within the armed carriers.
361	19	The most interesting impact of the event is what is happening in Russia, where we have been watching a change of tone for two days. The broadcasts of propaganda on Russian television, which for three months praised the virility and power of the Kremlin army, left the place to anger and unbelief. A famous commentator asked to hit the Nato countries and quoted Stalin, according to which those who were allowed to panic had to be shot down.
361	21	Even more significantly, on September 11th, the Czech leader Ramzan Kadyrov, after sending several contingents to Ukraine and walked among the ruins of Mariupol, questioned Moscow’s strategy. Kadyrov said that if things don’t change, he will go to talk with the president, Vladimir Putin, in the coming days.
361	23	The President of the Russian Federation has decided to react, which he has not yet done. The paradox is that Putin is contested not by those who oppose the war, but by those who complain him that he has not yet won it. The head of the Kremlin has not yet said the last word, and the risk of a growing is great. Since the evening of September 11, a missile rain has been landing over several cities, and electricity has been interrupted in three regions. This is the revenge of the tsar.
3610	1	The dance on the nuclear abyss. The great danger and what saves
3610	3	“Where the danger grows, there grows what saves.” There are two verses of Friedrich Hölderlin, which Martin Heidegger remediated in reading a “technical question”, that which had become nuclear, of which we were not, and we are unfortunately not yet, at the moral altitude. There are verses that can help us understand that only a frank look at the abyss can make us escape from the hills inside. The abyss is what we have seen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and today we are opening up in Ukraine. Let’s look at it in the scenarios it proposes.
3610	5	"We first take the most dangerous scenario from the field, because more illusory. That in Ukraine and through Ukraine, a collapse of Russia can be achieved without this culminating in a nuclear confrontation, either with ""tatic"" nuclear weapons. A foolishness from the battle propaganda of the Empire of the Good that we will be the Western, of which is Henry Kissinger, who slightly understands it, to warn us, inviting the West to offer a way of exit to Vladimir Putin, just because I’m ‘defeated’ on the plan of the conventional military confrontation with the failure of his ‘special operation’. For Europe and the West, on the conventional military level, Russia is obviously not a threat. Going beyond is an adventure. A stupid poker game, which would already be lost at the next hand. It would give Russia to China, expanding the military efficiency of its imperial project."
3610	7	Even worse is the scenario of the collapse of the Russian statuality, which the putinism has incarnated (good or bad, and worse than good for Russia and the world) after the collapse of the Urss, of which some useful idiot of the abyss blaters as a goal to. China would get directly to the Arctic Pole, and it would put the problem of the Russian nuclear arsenal, unless one or two imperial police (the western, essentially the US, and the Chinese) are imagined.
3610	9	They demand it from the ‘entities’ that from the collapse of the Russian statuality were born, to make it safe, just as it was done after the collapse of the USSR, bringing, with the consent of all, to the borders and under the control of Russia all the nuclear arsenal already present in the same Ukraine. It would be a world far more dangerous than this already dangerous.
3610	11	The other scenario, the deforestation of the tactical use of nuclear weapons, is a madness, which is a duty not even to imagine: in the most favorable hypothesis to the West (and that is, that it is not the first step of a global nuclear confrontation that would be the pure annihilation of human civilization; and then favorable to ‘which’ West?This would mean the inhabitability of Europe or a large piece of it, starting from Ukraine disputed, according to the winds regime, from Moscow to Rome to London. For decades, if not for centuries. Who is this suitable?
3610	13	It would be the least the end of Europe known, filled with iodine pests for its ‘future’ (which?and
3610	15	From all this comes one thing: not for love of peace, which would also be the master path of the future if this planet wants to have it, but for the purely ‘existencial’ interest of their peoples, Europe and Russia must ‘declare peace’. And the U.S. and China, as on these pages has been repeatedly written, if they have the heart of the world and not an impossible unilateral imperial primate – today more than the U.S., tomorrow more than China – must force Ukraine and Russia to silence the weapons in Donbass, and to find a solution, which could pass for a European guarantee on the status of the affected territories, making them hole on the thread of the continent in a reset of “Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals.”
3610	17	After our Old Continent, if the escalation did not stop, there might be still time and “history” for another abyss, which would open on the Pacific. Let’s look in face to reality. It is enough with the stupidities of the imperial chancellaries and with the most devil dimension of their action: stupidity. And to go down, in the cacaophony of the public debate, it is enough with the aggressive opinionism of the battalionist stupidity. It makes you feel the true people: those who reason and have heart.
3611	1	Migrants, now the NGs cry: “The right...”
3611	3	From the universe of the left-wing NGs the victimist plagiarism began after the victory of the central right to the elections. After Sea Watch, who complained immediately after the vote, now is Cecilia Strada, the daughter of Emergency founder, who raises the voice and puts the finger, accusing the central right to have made a lie-based electoral campaign. This is the most important part of the world’s economy, and the most important part of the world’s economy is the world’s economy.
3611	5	“As lies about rescue in the sea and NGOs are inculcate in the public opinion, people continue to die in the Mediterranean,” attacks Cecilia Strada, who speaks of a malleable public opinion and without discernment. The daughter of Emergency’s founder, speaks of a electoral campaign in which the tones, regarding the migration phenomenon, were “between the sensationalist and the foolish.” However, the data of the Ministry of the Interior are very clear about the landings: since January they have been over 70,000, so it is not just a perception but a reality that in Italy there has been an increase in the landings. And it’s not politics, it says the Ministry of the Interior, and Frontex says it.
3611	7	"But Cecilia Strada puts his finger on politics: ""It was to be expected that in the election campaign the topic would be instrumentalized. It has been spoken of an invasion that does not exist, as the numbers show the reception to the Ukrainian population, and of emergency, while the only emergency is that of those who are in Libya or die in the sea.” For some time, NGOs have been trying to balance Ukrainian refugees, who are mainly women and children and who escape from a war, with irregular migrants who are mainly men and young people, who have no recognition of international protection."
3611	9	And there is also an attempt to instrumentalize and move the point of the question: “Ukrainian refugees are white, there are people in whom stories we can immeditate. Whoever comes from the other side of the Mediterranean, instead, is told as someone who comes here to steal something. There is a kind of racism in the background, they are poor and black. For no one could accept that a white woman is raped more and more times, captured in the sea and handed over to her rapers, and that all this is done with the money of our taxes. I think these victims we would go to take them with the flights line. But they are poor and black.”
3611	11	But, above all, Cecilia Strada, which puts the finger against politics and the central right, contributes to spreading fake news about the naval blockade hypothesized by Giorgia Meloni, who has re-triped an indication provided by Europe. “Meloni thinks to scratch the fregates to intercept all the boats that cross the sea? Unless you think of a good European rescue mission. If we’re talking about filling the Mediterranean with ships so that no one else can get me, I’d be the first to stand up,” said Gino Strada’s daughter, completely overwhelming the sense of ship blockade.
3612	1	“War, Vittorio Feltri is stupid: “Zelensky is like Putin, he doesn’t want peace”
3612	3	The tumultuous days. Ordinate everywhere in the city, dead and wounded like rain.” It begins with the article of Vittorio Feltri about the war in Ukraine and the latest events of the confrontation with Russia, which reacted vigorously to the explosive attack on the Kerch Bridge in Crimea. The director of Libero, in the piece appeared on the first page in the October 11 edition, is hard too with the front of Kiev: “I am the effects of the most absurd war of the last decades. It is no longer clear who is wrong. Probably both competitors. We know that it was Moscow to attack the neighbors of the house, but we also know that these latter did not do anything to crack the enemies trying to avoid the disaster in place. We know that Vladimir Putin behaves like a bloody madman and with all good will we cannot be on his side. But we also know that Volodymyr Zelensky is not a puppy but a puppy puppy. So if the first goes in weapons against the second, this replace the great with equal fervor. In short, we are faced with two dangerous subjects in the same extent and unable to find a medium line that leads to peace.”
3612	4	"""The impression - continues Feltri - is that both the statistics are convinced that they can win a meaningless war that for now has damaged two peoples. Our feeling is that the conflict will be lasting and will end bad especially for the Ukrainians as their opponents have in their arsenals nuclear weapons that they will not hesitate to use in case of beautiful difficulties, determining a gap in the middle of Europe. Putin has already threatened to recourse to nuclear orders soon and is a fool, but a fool of word. It is right that a free country rebels against the invader and seeks to preserve its autonomy, but it is equally right that it proceeds to save itself from a massacre.”"
3612	5	“Why do the heads of the two fighting states not commit to finding a peaceful conclusion?” the question with which the journalist closes his intervention, warning all of the “risk of an endless and numerous victims massacre.”
3613	1	Peace or Submission?
3613	3	Those who participate in the demonstration for peace. And even among socialists or sedicents, I ask a few questions.
3613	5	Is it right or not to continue to support Ukrainian resistance that without the help of Europe and the United States would surrender to Putin’s invasion in a few days?
3613	7	What should Italy do for peace? Do we no longer help the Ukrainian resistance and differentiate from Europe and the Atlantic Alliance, as a result of its political and economic isolation just in view of the benefits of the Recovery?
3613	9	What negotiations are considered possible and what peace can be achieved until Putin bombs and massacres civilians, approves not his own territories that are legitimate by a referendum?
3613	11	4) Under what conditions do the pacifists mean that the Western community should push for peace? To the point of legitimating the Russian achievements achieved with the violence and massacres of men, women and children?
3613	13	5) The peace of the deceased as that which Don Carlo imputed to Philip II, the peace as submission, the peace as reason of the strongest? Peace as an exaltation of our fear that war touches us closer? The peace as indifference, the same that Filippo Turati attributed to the majority of socialists after Caporetto?
3613	15	Peace as a denial of international law is violence. It’s worse, much worse than the war today. It is the reference to the triumph of the war tomorrow. It says nothing that two traditionally social-democratic and neutral countries such as Sweden and Finland have asked to join the NATO?
3613	17	They may think that their defense of neutral states is no longer sufficient. Putin is a threat to our freedom. And if his peace triumphs, that is, the annexation of Ukraine or part of it, we will face the greatest danger to humanity. It would open the way to the denial of law and the triumph of force.
3613	19	A real negotiation cannot be regarded by the withdrawal of Russian troops on the front line on February 24, while Zelensky is ready to accept the freezing of the current situation in Crimea and the full neutrality of Ukraine. But the negotiations (finties) were there. The first in Vloblasc in Belarus, the last in Turkey and Lavrov and Kuleba also discussed 15 points, without finding an agreement. All this while the strikes of Busha and Mariupol were consumed.
3613	21	And yesterday the bombings in Zaporishia with dead, including children, and wounded. If ever the Russians will be forced to enter into agreements it will be especially for the progress of the Ukrainian troops who have already consolidated the reconquest of the Kharkiv area for a total of 4,000 square kilometers.
3613	23	On the other hand, if an agreement that prizes the right to sovereignty of the Ukrainian people, will be found, it will not depend on those who have turned themselves immediately as Italian Left or after a while as Conte against the sending of military aid. But thanks to these. A peace in respect of the right to the self-determination of the peoples, as by the socialist gospel.
3614	1	“Sanctions are not enough.” Do they want war?
3614	3	"On ""Agi"" a few days later appeared an article in which it was thoroughly explained that sanctions against China and Russia were not enough. Just so, it is not enough. Now, the fact that the sanctions against Russia and even China do not work appears obvious and beyond any reasonable doubt: as we have already shown dozens of times, these are sanctions that for the first time in human history go to the nickname of those who punish and not those who are punished. Therefore, they are sanctions that the sanctioner has no interest to do but that he must do, even against his will, because forced by his master, in this case the dollar civilization: they are not even sure in fact that the European Union does not want to do them, knowing its highest level of free servility compared to the star and strike civilization. A civilization of which he is and is known as a colony, desiring to serve his master in every way. The point of the question, however, is elsewhere in this case: the article from which I took the moves seems to suggest not so much that the sanctions are wrong, just because they don’t work; on the contrary, it says that they are not enough, as to emphasize that if they don’t give the expected effects and why they must be affinated by further and different measures, which make the sanctions themselves more effective and more durable the aggression against the enemy. And right now it should sound the alarm bell, because from the article it seems to emerge that, since the sanctions are not enough, the next step could be the war. On the other hand, it has been months that the speakers and the monopolyists of the word work indefensively to prepare the public opinion for the hypothesis of a war against an enemy so impatient and scared that it must be fought by any means, even with the nuclear war. Where will we end? This is the question that we must really and courageously ask, without making ourselves illusions."
3615	1	Washington's doubt about Kiev
3615	3	Give up the tones of support without and without but, in the last few weeks something stones in the relationship between Washington and Kiev. “Washington” is not just synonymous with “Joe Biden” and more than anyone in America suggests now a powerful brake to unconditional support to Kiev, even at the cost of putting the finger on Ukrainian behavior.
3615	5	Washington to Kiev
3615	7	We begin with the latest event, the sabotage of the Kerch Bridge. “It was the Ukrainian intelligence services that orchestrated the explosion at the bridge in Crimea,” the New York Times quotes a Kiev government official. According to the source, remaining anonymous due to the government’s ban to talk about the explosion, Kiev’s spy would orchestrate the attack, using a bomb truck driven through the bridge. The question is: why does one of the main U.S. newspapers blame on the first page the alleged Ukrainian guilt in the operation, treating behind an anonymous source?
3615	9	A similar move had concerned, a few days ago, the attack on Daria Dugina. On October 5, the New York Times, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, that the attack on August 23 would have been approved by some elements of the Ukrainian government. Not only. The U.S. newspaper laid out some accredits and some failures in communication with Kiev, stating that “the U.S. did not take part in the attack, neither providing information nor other assistance” even though “they were aware of the operation in advance.” The claims are becoming even more crazy, adding that the U.S. “will be opposed to the murder if they were consulted” and that later, they have even warned the Ukrainians for the murder.
3615	11	The U.S. stops the attacks
3615	13	Also on the shipment of weapons, the White House brakes. Ukraine has called for the launch of strategic long-range missiles (the Atacams) to strengthen the counteroffensive. These are missile systems that can fly about 200 miles, about four times the distance of the missiles used by the Himars mobile systems that the U.S. began to send to Ukraine four months ago. Despite the proposal, the Biden administration claims that Ukraine is very well connected with the systems it currently has. In fact, about two weeks ago, the U.S. administration had announced the financing of another 18 Himars, bringing the total to more than 30 systems of this type. The deep fear is that the Atacams would cross a red line in the eyes of Moscow, which would see the United States becoming a direct part of the conflict.
3615	15	The “prudence” of the United States
3615	17	The reasons for Washington’s prudence are numerous and surely translate a divergence of opinions between the actors called in question (Departments, White House, intelligence) aggravated by a titubious and temporary presidency. The midterm is approaching, and although foreign policy tends not to contribute to the American election outcomes, the White House is very cautious in guiding the United States towards a potential European pantano. Biden has a lot of other grates in the next four weeks, which will depend on the next two years of presidency. It remains true that managing the Ukrainian matter is not easy for anyone. Although more than anyone screams to war “for prosecutor”, the United States does not need it at all after twenty years of war on terror, two pandemic and a star inflation. But a line that passes for support to Kiev without entering the war against Moscow is almost impossible if you are the United States of America. In Washington’s logic, thus, braking Kiev’s enthusiasm could serve to throw out the opponent’s anger. But if it is really this game, the result appears twice miserable.
3615	19	There is then to say that Kiev and Washington have two different levels of warfare practice. For the first, the war is a novelty in recent history, or at least it has been until 2014. Seconds fight at the highest level of expertise ever. And they master tactics and strategy, as well as communication. But above all, they look at the other side of the Atlantic with a cold that Kiev cannot have. In light of this, the hand-trapped brake from the White House is more than justified, at least in theory.
3615	21	Among these two “friends, not allies”, however, a communication defect remains. The New York Times has repeatedly emphasized that the Americans would be angry by the lack of transparency on military plans, especially on Russian territory. If the Pentagon and the 007 Americans have shared with the Ukrainians sensitive information on the battlefield, the counterpart has not always communicated their intentions to U.S. officials.
3615	23	The Battle of Congress
3615	25	Another major battlefield is the U.S. Congress. The shelters to protect Kiev last February, which discomforted the Marshall plan, the landing in Normandy and even Nuremberg, now seem to be a distant eco. A growing coro of high-ranking personalities began to wonder: if the wealthy European nations, as well as NATO members, do not intend to adequately finance a war in their homes, why should America do so?
3615	27	The Congress, which manages the accounts of Washington, has long begun to spread huge amounts to support the war in Ukraine, which does not give signs of de-escalation. So soon, the transversal blockade of the Republicans+Dixiecrats could put the veto on this funding at expense. And after the midterm, if Biden came out defeated, it will be really difficult to maintain this standard of elevations. The authors of the Ostrusionism will always have an important axis in the manic: revenge the 2% ghost that agites the NATO and the relations between the two spots of the Atlantic. A always cheap argument that can close the U.S. rubinets to the shadow on Kiev.
3616	1	Who commands the Kremlin?
3616	3	Who commands the Kremlin? Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. But the question that we ask in Washington, on the 229th day of the war in Ukraine, is real and serious. The obvious change in the Russian military strategy, with a rain of missiles and “suicide drones” on civilian areas of Ukraine, is not only seen as a retortion, an escalation if unpredictable, predictable, in response to the explosion of the day before on the bridge of connection with Crimea, is seen as a very strong “political” signal directed towards various targets. In Moscow, the clamorous crisis of the management of the “special operation”, culminated in the lack of surveillance of the Kerč bridge and in the lack of prevention of attacks such as the Sunday, has produced significant silrations and replacement to the military heights as part of a maneuver of moving the political decision-making center on the side of the “falch”. In the point that we are wondering whether Putin is listening to them or is it even a hostage and to what extent. What is the current autonomous force of the Russian president, is it still how often has it been defined, for his ostentated power, the tsar? The voices of characters such as those of the number two in fact Dmitry Medvedev, the Czech Rmazan Kadyrov, the number one of Crimea Zergei Aksynov, the star of journalism Alexander Kotz resonate with the sicumera of who has the control of the leaves they count. You notice their statements, they are something more than the usual coro that accompanies the decisions of the Supreme Chief. “It’s not an isolated act of rejection but a new way to fight the war,” says Kotz, synthesizing what happened on Monday and giving it a political reading.
3616	5	Does Putin still have the full and unique control of the nuclear button? “It is clearly said – said Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin – that it is he who makes the decision [to launch a nuclear attack], his is the decision of a man alone. He has no balances, and as he has taken the irresponsible decision to invade Ukraine, he can make another decision.”
3616	7	But is it still so, is the nuclear bag still fully in his hands?
3616	9	The question that, by the American side, does not only refer to the actual, current power hierarchy in the Kremlin, after eight months of a war which is a succession of failures constelled of errors and horrors, but it refers to the real interlocutor with whom to build a possible way of exit and scale an escalation out of control of the conflict, which could culminate in the use of nuclear weapons.
3616	11	In his last release, on October 6, Joe Biden said words that in controls were read as the possible reproduction of a scenario similar to what ended the crisis triggered by the installation of Soviet missiles in Cuba, when he arrived at the edge of the atomic bar and stopped one millimeter earlier thanks to a secret agreement between Kennedy and Krusciov, which by the American side, shortly later, would result in the withdrawal of the room missiles in Turkey, considered by the USSR a direct threat. The American writer Arnaldo Testi, rebuilding that crisis, notes that “the agreement was so secret that the U.S. leadership saw the public solution of the crises as a blow to its prestige.” Is there already something similar to that negotiation between Moscow and Washington? And if so, can we continue in the light of the last events?
3616	13	Commenting on the explosion on the Crimea bridge last Sunday, the head of the United States, Mike Mullen, described Putin as “a winged animal, increasingly dangerous, to take a lot seriously, taking all the measures that are required”, but concluding that all of this “this also tells us of the need to go to the table” (the negotiation).
3616	15	A hope that the next day, the Monday of the attacks from the sky to the Ukrainian urban centers, presents itself in a very different scenario, which seems to close spirals to negotiating solutions such as those which, though very hypothetical, seemed to profile before the escalation and then before the Kremlin’s claim of the “party” of the war at the outskirts, of what, to say with Medvedev, will have to end with the “complete dismantling” of the Ukrainian leadership.
3616	17	The call of the U.S. Embassy in Kiev to the co-owners for leaving Ukraine “using available and secure land transportation” sounds like the confirmation of a stop to any possible, no matter how super secret, conversation between Washington and Moscow. This does not mean that there are significant changes on the military level, especially when it comes to the supply of long-range weapons capable of hit targets in the heart of Russia. Biden will also have invested in the victory of Ukraine, but, at least so far, he has also done everything possible to prevent NATO forces from being trapped into the war or provoking the use of nuclear weapons by Russia. But this could also reveal an exile and labile border, easily valid by the Ukrainians, who – not known if according to a copy agreed with Washington or spying the allies – have committed uncovered actions by the Pentagon and the CIA, as the same attack on the Crimea bridge.
3616	19	It should be said that if the new “majority” that Putin condemns can infiltrate itself from the angry reactions of America, the EU and NATO, it cannot do the same against powers like China and India, which have increasing strategic importance with the acceleration of the conflict and Russian isolation. And, in fact, New Delhi’s “deep concern” is very relevant for the escalation of the conflict, with the recommendation, in accordance with Beijing, to the “de-escalation” and to the dialogue.
3617	1	The shadow of U.S. support for Ukraine
3617	3	Two news, both published by the New York Times, have given in recent days a very different image, compared to that generally viewed by the media, of the relationship between the United States and Ukraine regarding the war. Washington politically and militarily supports Kiev against Moscow and wants to prevent Vladimir Putin from obtaining a victory by violating international law. But the administration of Biden is often skeptical and irritated by some behaviors of the government of Volodymyr Zelensky.
3617	5	Ukraine killed Darya Dugina
3617	7	The most clamorous case relates to the terrorist attack with which on August 20 was murdered in Moscow Darya Dugina, the daughter of the philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, proud supporter of the Kremlin expansionist policies. The murder in summer was attributed to Russia itself, but as revealed to Nyt by some U.S. officials the attack was instead orchestrated by Kiev.
3617	9	The operation “was authorized by parties of the Ukrainian government,” which had not informed the United States of their intentions. If they did, the source continues, the U.S. would be opposed and when the truth emerged, the U.S. government protested with Kiev, intimidating the Zelensky administration not to repeat such actions anymore. In fact, not only such attacks do not get any practical advantage, the Republic explains, but they risk making Putin angry by leading him to making unconsidered decisions.
3617	11	As Fausto Biloslavo writes on the Journal, “It almost seems that the advanced Ukrainian on the field concerns the Americans, for a possible unplanned, i.e. nuclear reaction of Moscow. Or that certain objectives were agreed, but that the army of Kiev, raised by victory, continues to advance by exposing itself too much.”
3617	13	The weapons market in Kiev
3617	15	The revelation of the Nyt does not doubt the U.S. support to Ukraine in any way: 24 hours before the publication of the article, Washington approved a new supply of weapons of $625 million. But as the Times has revealed, in some cases the military support to Kiev by the Biden administration has been ignored.
3617	17	The reference is not to the official weapons supplies that the U.S. government guarantees. But those that allow and encourage by private intermediaries. The newspaper, hand-to-hand documents, revealed the attempt by two private citizens residing in the United States, Martin Zlatev and Heather Gjorgjievski, to sell $30 million of missiles, missiles, shuttle and ammunition to Kiev. 7% of the total amount, about $2 million, would remain in the pocket of the two individuals.
3617	19	The weapons, in part American, would have been manufactured mostly in Bulgaria and Bosnia, countries that prohibit weapons exports to Ukraine, and brought to Kiev through Poland. Other would be transmitted by truck through Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Slovakia and Poland. All with the involvement of numerous and dangerous intermediaries. To allow the purchase of weapons and their transit even in banned countries, the two Americans had falsified the documents and in any case managed to approve the purchase from Washington.
3617	21	The U.S. game is dangerous.
3617	23	The risk, explains experts interrogated by Nyt, is that each of the intermediaries in the case may cause some of the weapons to be sold to terrorist groups or the best provider. Only in the first four months of the year, the State Department has authorized $300 million of U.S. private weapons supplies to Kiev, compared to $15 million of the entire 2021. If normally every business of this kind takes weeks or months to be approved, the Biden administration has given the ok to contracts such as that of Zlatev and Gjorgjievski within “a few hours.”
3617	25	“The U.S. Department should sound a warning bell,” says Jodi Vittori, a professor at Georgetown University who studies weapons trade. Not only because of the risk that weapons end in the wrong hands, but also because the prices demanded by the private are exorbitant compared to the real value of the supply and “to lose us is a nation in the middle of a war.”
3617	27	Moreover, once the conflict is over, Ukraine could become a hub for the illegal sale of weapons: “As at the time of the Cold War, Kiev would be a big black market,” explains Elias Yousif, a researcher at the Stimson Center. And many of these weapons could end in the hands of the enemies of Europe and the United States. Also for this Biden should be careful about the way he provides support to Kiev.
3618	1	"The air throwing, the horror of Vittorio Feltri: ""Putin-Zelensky? What end will they do with us.”"
3618	3	"“It seems to me difficult to give life to a negotiation if the same Volodymyr Zelensky crashes the bridges in a very violent way”: Vittorio Feltri, the guest of Myrta Merlino in L’Aria shooting on La7, sees with difficulty a diplomatic and non-violent end of the war in Ukraine. The founder of Libero, in connection with the talk, explained: ""We are faced not with a tiger, which would be Russia, and an eagle, but we are faced with two tiger that give them holy reason and do not show any intention to find a way out of a war that is sliding towards the nuclear."""
3618	5	This is what I wish to Luigi Di Maio: a brutal Victory Feltri
3618	7	"The possible use of atomic weapons - remains Feltri - ""will naturally be devastating throughout Europe, including those countries that supplied weapons to Zelensky and then became objectively complicated. Not to mention the U.S., experts in atomic bombs, having thrown them two on Japan many years ago.”"
3618	9	It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do.
3618	11	“In 10 days...” Feltri and the prophecy about the new government: what we will assist
3618	13	"According to Vittorio Feltri, ""this is not that this world is righteous by gentle people."" He then pointed out: “There is, first of all, Putin, who is incredibly ferocious, but Zelensky also does not joke. And it also shows that he doesn’t find a way to make Putin understand that it’s time to end it. And he could do so from my point of view, not because he has now assumed a role of leader, of world king.”"
3618	15	It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do.
3619	1	Russia is “finally” in war with Ukraine
3619	3	Seven months after the fall into an obvious trap (see article) the word “war” had not yet been officially used by the Russian president in reference to the Ukrainian conflict. Although used once in today’s speech and referred to the conflict that has been ongoing since 2014, it is now uncertainly apparent.
3619	5	The partial mobilization unmistakably reveals the scale in which the country has entered: “...the citizens who are in the reserve and above all, those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military specialization and a relevant experience will be subject to complaint.”
3619	7	It took many months between the remodulation of forces and fronts, the purges of commanders and above all... tens of thousands of dead and wounded to come to the decision.
3619	9	It was late, not desperate.
3619	11	For a long time, the President of Ukraine declared the goal of the complete restoration of the borders, including Crimea. The “territorial integrity” of Russia was therefore already at risk; there will not be any (now written) referendum of accession to the Federation to change something or to justify the possible escalation.
3619	13	In their turn, the heights of the Russian armed forces did not wait for formalizations: for weeks, modern media (such as the T-90M - photo opening) are gathering in various areas near the Ukrainian border.
3619	15	Is the storm coming?
3619	17	A slow but constant advance, over the past few months, had turned into a position war that, between trincees and civilian massacres, had brought back to mind (respectively) the previous world conflicts.
3619	19	The forces on the ground in the “special operation” were not suitable for taking defensive positions strengthened for months of work. Is it possible that some officials have been wondering if the strategy to be adopted is not to retire instead of to go down?
3619	21	If so, quickly leaving a territory – prepared and already well-known – made out to the discovered forces the Ukrainians (will win even because of their unbearable propaganda), the Russians could soon make a micidial blow and be able to make incursions along the 2500 kilometers of the border (including the Belarusian).
3619	23	We remember the basic rule in the ongoing game: the Russian territory is not touched (the definement would justify an immediate war “upgrade” by Moscow). Is this rule still valid? Certainly, the Ukrainians can only advance along the countryside, at their own home. Violating it would lead to a total mobilization by giving immense moral strength to those who so far have more or less inevitably felt as an invader.
3619	25	What could the Russians do now? To double the (international) funding for the same adversary propaganda: the sudden and unexpected “blinds” do not sometimes make those who are surprised rise from the ground.
3619	27	Instead, the West needs patience and – above all – not to underestimate a opponent who cannot afford a defeat even on the ground.
3619	29	"""Politically"" Russia has already lost the same 24th February: it has destroyed an international position gained in decades of work to become a servant of a superpower (the People's Republic of China) which officially can also allow itself formal distances or even a hypocrite mediation. He will always have to go to his hand to eat."
3619	31	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for a tremendous counteroffensive, leaving space and word to the only professionals in division.
3619	33	This is also in information: two-money propagandists make them smile for a while, but in the long run they are always counterproductive.
3619	35	Peace is far away. And for the next time in history it will be decided by weapons, not by good intentions.
3619	37	In Italy, beyond the “we are ready”, are we really ready? (To throw your head out of a hole in the ground)
362	1	Lukashenko insults Zelensky: “Here are your dirty legs.” And then the voice on the kamikaze drones.
362	3	"Tensions are rising in Ukraine. During the bombings in Kiev, Alexander Lukashenko said that NATO and other European countries are evaluating the possibility of launching an attack on Belarus. ""In the West there is the widespread belief that the Belarusian army will participate in a direct way in the special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,"" said the President of Belarus, who has always been on the side of Vladimir Putin, who has called for an urgent meeting of the armed forces top in Minsk."
362	5	“After believing these theories, the political and military leadership of the Atlantic Alliance and a number of European countries are already openly evaluating the options for a possible aggression against our country, up to a nuclear attack,” he said.
362	7	"Then Lukashenko and Putin agreed to deploy a joint regional group of troops. Not only. According to some Ukrainian media reports, just from Belarus would be “decolled ten kamikaze drones.” The means “crossed the border in the Volyn region.” Lukashenko also to the Belta agency that he sent a message to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warning him not to ""touch with his dirty legs a single meter of territory"" of Belarus."
3620	1	The “nuclear rhetoric” of the Kremlin
3620	3	In the UN Security Council, Moscow has exercised the veto power to prevent the adoption of the condemnation resolution of the “referendum” of annexation of the four Ukrainian regions by Russia. The referendum-farsa took place with Russian or philosophical soldiers armed up to the teeth who entered the houses with transparent votes to “learn” Ukrainian citizens to vote. It was obvious that he would win the “yes”, but it is equally obvious that a voted in this way cannot have any validity. So the percentages spread by the Russian authorities are dramatically ridiculous: Lugansk 97.7, Donetsk 97.74, Kherson 97.74 and Zaporizhzhya 96.94. The whole West has called this referendum “a farce,” but China, for example, has taken the distance.
3620	5	As if it wasn’t enough, becoming the territory of the Russian Federation, the men of the annex regions will be involved in the “mobility” decided by Putin and, therefore, will be forced to fight. In addition, the attempts to regain those regions by the Ukrainians, with military operations similar to those successfully carried out in the Kharkiv region, will be considered by the Kremlin an attack on Russia.
3620	7	In the current state of things, the Russian invasion of Ukraine could become the greatest geopolitical mistake of the twentieth century. The severity of the situation can no longer be denied, and now, after several months of claims that everything was going “as planned”, the Russian dictator was forced to admit that drastic measures were needed to prevent a disaster.
3620	9	Putin insists that his threat of using nuclear weapons is not a bluff. There is no way to know in advance if this is true. Despite this uncertainty, it is clear that the international community simply cannot afford to be intimidated in this way.
3620	11	If the West had to respond to Putin's nuclear threats by leaving Ukraine, it would have devastating consequences for international security and the whole concept of non-nuclear proliferation would be delivered to the patch of history. We will enter a new dangerous era of chronic instability marked by nuclear defeats and war of aggression. The only way to avoid this fate is to oppose Putin before it’s too late.
3620	13	Putin knows he is directed towards the disaster in Ukraine, but he hopes that the fear of a nuclear apocalypse will allow him to draw victory to defeat. Despite the strikes of arrest over the past few months, he remains convinced that the democratic world has a weak heart and will eventually withdraw.
3620	15	If the Western leaders do not act consistently now, they will regret it for decades.
3621	1	Is Ukraine an Appendix to Russia? This is a fake news from Putin.
3621	3	What should not be neglected in the conflict in Ukraine is that the history of the country before 1991, year of independence from the Soviet Union, was written by others, especially by the Russians. This means that the current censorship prevented any research on national identity. This gave rise to mystery, altered readings, distorted truths. It does not end up Vladimir Putin’s assumption that Russians and Ukrainians would be a single people, with the seconds related to the simple appendix of the motherland of Russia. It’s a real truth that is comfortable for a certain West, collusive or just isolationist and little long-looking. Without forgetting another West, which, underestimating the effects of ethnic cleansing to the damage of the Russian minority in the Donbass region, ended with providing Putin the dangerous alibi of “denazization”.
3621	5	But historical lies do not remain unpunished, neither for the authors nor for those who suffer them. The last generation dictators, from Saddam Hussein to Muammar Gaddafi, could confirm it if they were still here. However, the lie is insised in the nature of the tyrant, who, otherwise, could not exercise a struggle against his people. Only a false reality can feed out a power out of measure. This applies to the emperors of ancient times as well as to the contemporary autocrates. In our case, historical lies have generated a historical ignorance, so the majority are not aware of the centrality of Ukraine over the centuries, especially in the encounter with the West, and are linked to old and foolish common places.
3621	7	In uncertain and relatively recent times (2002), a conference entitled “The age of Kiev and its heritage in the encounter with the West”, brought to light the protagonism of Ukraine and its memory. The international conference, promoted by the Institute for the Research of Social and Religious History of Vicenza, attended Italian, Ukrainian, Polish and Russian scholars. In that context, Nina Kowalska, then Ukrainian ambassador at the Holy See, remained as important for the scientists of her country not to remain isolated for the recovery of truth against the stereotypes that falsely presented the history of her people, starting with the recognition of a common European foundation in cultural and religious aspects.
3621	9	On the other hand, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe already said that the mother tongue of Europe was Christianity and, therefore, even the countries of the Middle and East spoke this common language. Ukraine, in particular, was the ground of confrontation between the various Christian flows, but it must be said that the Catholic tradition was,, decisive for the formation and independence of the state and the tendency to feel European. Furthermore, well before the request of President Volodymyr Zelenski to join the European Union, the historic Olga Nedavnya, always in 2002, quoted the 2010 Ukraine program, prepared by the President of the Republic, ministries, central and local institutions, in which the return to European values was proclaimed as the foundation of the renate Ukrainian state, recognizing its common spiritual bases.
3621	11	In fact, it is the arrival of the Mongols in the 13th century to clearly divide the territory of the so-called Rus’ into two parts: one area dominated by the new invaders, which will become Russia and will look to the East, and another, which already looked to the West and that would become Ukraine. Karol Wojtyla himself, before climbing the pontifical threshold, said that the border of Europe was “where the area of spread of the Gospel and that of the Mongol invasion of Asia were met.” This is also why the Slavist St. Graciotti talked about two Slavs and two Europe, with Kiev taking a key role thanks to the synthesis work he had worked over the centuries between East and West.
3621	13	It is precisely Ukraine exporting culture to Russia in the second half of the Sixties and in the first decades of the Sixties. And, despite the subsequent censorship and repression, traces of teaching we find postum. Even in the early two thousand years, the Slavs fought into a new contradiction: on the one hand, Russia’s possible NATO membership; on the other hand, the Russian writer Aleksandr Nikolaevich Afanasiev’s denounce of a new political and cultural isolation of his country against Europe, seen again as antagonist. The expectations, however, were so high, that Graciotti, in the Acts of the aforementioned Conference edited by Viella, stated: “Ukraine is our alternative to Eastern Europe. Pluralist, full of discussions within it, used to comparing with the other, presents itself as the possible mediator between the East and the West for a European integration and I think it should become it also at the diplomatic political level.” Unhearded words, great opportunity lost.
3622	1	Orsini, “Putin fights with the hands tied.” The Near Nuclear War
3622	3	"“This is a war between Russia and 31 countries. Russia is terribly powerful because it is against the 30 NATO countries plus Ukraine. “Russia is not using all its potential, it is fighting with tied hands.” He is almost admired, Alessandro Orsini, in the analysis of the war that in the last hours has recorded a new, dramatic escalation. ""The Russian bombings of yesterday - explains the professor, in a study by Bianca Berlinguer in Cartabianca on Rai 3, regarding the Russian attack in Kiev - are a real crime against the Ukrainian civilian population. Unfortunately, the basic conditions for the launch of tactical nuclear weapons have been set.” The scenario is increasingly terrible."
3622	5	“To whom the sabotage is judged.” North Stream, the earthquake of Rampini
3622	7	"What to do at this point? According to Orsini, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""is radical because we allow him: we give Ukraine money and weapons. It would be little enough for Biden to get a more moderate attitude from Zelensky. I don’t see any columns at this moment.” Federico Rampini, correspondent of the Corriere della Sera, offers another point of view: “Biden’s United States is always a step back from what Zelensky asks and desires. Also in America there are thousands of uncertainty about how to get out of this war.”"
3622	9	“For Biden is tired.” We are in the trap of Putin.
3622	11	In the words of Andrea Scanzi, “Eight months after the beginning of the war, are we sure that the right strategy is to supply more and more weapons to Ukraine? It does not seem to have brought great results. Meanwhile, Zelensky is asking to reinforce it more and more and not to dialogue with Putin.”
3622	13	“From Kherson disastrous news. The Ukrainians...” Near the nuclear war?
3623	1	The New Soviet War on the Free World
3623	3	Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin's speech at the ceremony for the signature of the Agreement of Accession to the Russian Federation of Ukrainian Donbass provinces was a demand against the Free States of the West.
3623	5	It was also the first time that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was called a tragedy. On the background, the description of Ukraine as a state, in substance, governed by the neo-Nazi. It is the reconstruction of a iron curtain. An explicit threat to those already Soviet States, which are still or not part of the Confederation of Independent States, which have embraced or embraced philosophical policies. It is also a threat to the states once part of the Warsaw Pact, now members of the Atlantic Alliance and members of the European Union.
3623	7	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovyč Zelens’kyj has called for an accelerated accession procedure to the Atlantic Alliance. He also stated that this alliance, in itself, is already existing in the facts. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has declared this a right for every free state of Europe. Article 5 of the Constitutional Treaty of the Organization obliges all Member States to intervene, if one of them is attacked.
3623	9	In this context, it was undoubtedly wise the decision of the Italian voters who voted in the last national political elections. At this time, among the States of the Alliance, the motto of the three mosquitoes must be valid: “One for all, all for one!” It is the most clear Italian political exponent in its Atlanticism, and for character the most extensive to face, hardly, the challenges.
3624	1	The explosion of the Kerch Bridge
3624	3	Almost twenty-four hours after the sabotage that led to the partial destruction of the Kerch bridge, more than anything does not return. In particular, because, in a conflict that increasingly takes over the nuances of the rule of suspicion, it is necessary to wonder, even before how, who really gives the image of that structure in flame. But especially those who have an interest that the international public opinion thinks in a way rather than in another in the magnum sea of the information war that we are watching since February.
3624	5	Kiev does not claim
3624	7	The first grey zone is represented by Kiev’s waveful attitude that, within a day, has passed from the victorious tones that can be assimilated to a claim (no longer, however, neither from Zelensky nor from any military authority) to a kind of taking distance as Mauro Indelicato well emphasized in this piece. At least the triumphant attitude of the Ukrainians who see a symbolic goal being marked, which has its roots in the 2014 events in Crimea, must be exchanged for a claim.
3624	9	Zelensky only followed this news with a comic weather report. During his night video speech on Telegram, the Ukrainian leader laughed saying the conditions were “nude in Crimea.” The President of Ukraine said: “Today was a good and mostly sunny day in our country. “On much of the territory there were about 20 degrees Celsius and sun. “Unfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea, although it was still hot. But anyway the clouds are, the Ukrainians know what to do and know that our future is sunny. “This is the future without invaders, throughout our territory, especially in Crimea.”
3624	11	It was from the Russian side.
3624	13	By passing to the most technical elements, it was learned in the hours following the explosion that the explosive convoy came from the Russian side. Was it checked? Who led him?
3624	15	A 25-year-old Russian man was found to be the owner of the truck that, according to the Russian authorities, would make the bridge jump in air. But he was not driving the medium: the forces of the Russian order cited a certain Samir Yusubov, resident in the Russian city of Krasnodar – about an hour drive from the camp that supplies Vladimir Putin's troops in southern Ukraine – as the registered owner of the truck marked International Prostar. In a video filmed by Baza Media and published on social media, the young-apparently disappointed-ha said that an older relative, Makhir Yusubov, 52, was using the vehicle. In the video of just 28 seconds, the young man swears that he has nothing to do with sabotage.
3624	17	The cause of the explosion
3624	19	The exact cause of the explosion remains unknown. But the main hypothesis is that it was exploded by a bomb truck. The closed circuit cameras of the bridge show the deflagration on the apparently centralized charging around a large semiconductor. The camera screens from the bridge also show the truck that stops at a lock place before it can pass the Kerch bridge. If the inesco departed from the truck, this means two things: that a) the driver was a kamikaze (how much voted to the case or not, it is hard to know) and that b) the operation was designed in Russia. What kind of frange? From the environments close to Putin, desiring to have material to scredit the enemy? Or dissident Russians, ready to minate a symbol of the Kremlin in Crimea?
3624	21	Tony Spamer, a former British army expert in bridge demolition, has questioned the theory of the autobomb in the Wall Street Journal. He explained that the explosion of a similar instrument would make the road jump, but would not cause a structural collapse. “You have to attack the entire width of the bridge. Looking at it, it seems that he was attacked from below. “He repeated.
3624	23	Other theories indicate a mysterious shape that moves under the bridge, captured by closed circuit cameras a few seconds before the explosion. For many, it could be a drone loaded with bombs. Some experts argue that it is instead of explosives on the road bridge and on the train bridge, launched almost simultaneously using a coded radio command. This means that, when it comes to Ukrainian secret services, the bridge blinded with ten different systems of protection, so blinded was not.
3624	25	The exchange of accusations between Moscow and Kiev
3624	27	The exchange of accusations between Moscow and Kiev has soon begun. Ukrainian intelligence services may be responsible for the explosion that took place yesterday morning on the Kerch Bridge, according to the New York Times, which would quote a senior Ukrainian official. The source would confirm the reports issued by the Russian authorities, according to which Ukraine would be responsible for the attack. The official, speaking in condition of anonymity due to the ban imposed by the Kiev government to discuss sabotage, added that Ukrainian intelligence services would have orchestrated the explosion using a bomb charged on a truck, which was then passed through the bridge.
3624	29	Kiev is answering. “The explosion of the so-called Putin bridge, in our opinion, is an internal operation of one of the Russian special services.” This is stated in an interview with the Sera Corriere Mykhailo Podolyak, President Zelensky's adviser, who reminds the sabotage to the conflict between the two towers of the Kremlin, the Russian Defense Ministry and the FSB. This is why the services of the Ministry of Defense would have hit him, to bring the fault to the special secret services. In support of this thesis, Podolyak says that “according to geolocation information, the truck arrived from Russian territory. The same vehicle is Russian. The synchronization of the explosion with the passing of fuel load indicates the careful planning of the operation.” All such operations—from the murder of Dugin’s daughter, passing through the North Stream gas pipeline explosions and the explosion on the Kerch Bridge—have the same signature. It’s Russian,” he said.
3624	31	According to his Twitter account, Francis Fukuyama, who not only had predicted that the bridge would be hit shortly, but raises a legitimate doubt: “It is interesting how many high-quality photos and videos there are of the bridge just before, during and after the explosion.” And again: “Why should Russia announce this humiliation so quickly?”
3624	33	To want to reject the rule of the Cartesian evidence, it is too easy to see the Ukrainian signature on the Kerch Bridge. This is a symbolic goal, but it must be remembered that at such a delicate time of reconquest of the territory, such an operation would be complex and destabilizing. How should we not stop asking ourselves: What would Moscow – and who in that of Moscow – earn from this crowd of images and from painting Kiev as a state that attacks “civil” infrastructures, even in an illegally attached territory? So much.
3625	1	Welcome to the Age of Political Maturity (Hope)
3625	3	The concept of “political maturity”. Claudio Velardi gathered Guido Crosetto, Maria Elena Boschi and Gianni Cuperlo to present his book, “Impressions of September”, which collects the podcasts recorded in the weeks before the vote and broadcast in advance in the now mythological chat LDMN.
3625	5	The show is remarkable: the three, who have very different stories and approaches, raised by Myrta Merlino’s questions, gave the first proof of a convergence on the emergencies that the country is facing, from the energy crisis to the war, from inflation to the achievement of the Pnrr goals. Crosetto has for months placed on the table a “pact with the opponents” (he said it on August 4 to the Corriere) to disconnect the most disastrous effects of the economic conjunction, which can put into a “civil war.” A opening that did not please some members of Fratelli d’Italia, a party co-founded by Crosetto who, in the meantime, left the policy active to lead the association of Defense companies. And that he reiterated in several occasions, before and after the vote, especially in the transition of delivery from the old to the new government and on the writing of the Budget Act.
3625	7	An endpoint, and of comprehensible vanto, is the position on the war in Ukraine. “No party with 5 percent in Parliament against 95 percent would keep a serious, rigid, intransigent line, like that which was held by Giorgia Meloni.” And that’s what the former sub-secretary is expected from his current opponents: an opposition that makes choices not by the party, but for the country, where it risks that “everyone throws a cerin and burns my square.” Because in other countries there are roads that walk all, shared long-term choices. It is called national interest. And we saw the example when Mattarella and Draghi clinged to the side of Giorgia Meloni to say: It is not necessary that a third country guarantees the rights in Italy. We have antibodies to defend ourselves.”
3625	9	We are really ready for this phase of political maturity, the only quality “which can save the country”? Boschi, speaking on behalf of a Third Pole who said he was ready to collaborate on the most urgent points, gathers the invitation, while asking for account of the international location of Fratelli d’Italia. “We’re going to be with Macron. Is it going to be with Vox?
3625	11	Cuperlo, who returns to the House in the Pd group, although remarking that we will not have a “right-center” government but right-wing, has committed to not making a fireful opposition, but serious and based on respect. Also of the right-wing thought, which has a strength and a tradition that “not are the shells of that there.”
3625	13	It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do. There was a lack of the 5 Stars (from him called the “senile version of communism”), the Lega and Forza Italia. Meanwhile, a piece of Parliament is able to speak openly and without fear of the predictable accusations of injection. It is a good beginning.
3626	1	Peace is not devotion. The version of Flowers
3626	3	The war is becoming more and more unbearable, but the proof of the Ukrainian firmness, the sacrifice of an attacked people, the suffering of civilians under the bombs of the Putin army cannot fall into the empty. It cannot therefore be a call to peace that dissolves ambiguously on the flat demand of a ceasefire, without identifying who should operate in this direction. It is in Moscow to make a gesture of good will.
3626	5	A relaxation of the public opinion, on the wave of a seductive pacifism, would constitute in power the aval of the imperial logic of Russia. This does not take away that you think of peace and work for it, trying to find the spaces, even the minimum, of a diplomatic initiative. However, diplomacy is a necessary projection of politics, it does not live and exist regardless of politics. So far, Europe has kept a strict line, even putting its legitimate interests at risk: it has not surrendered to the “gas threat” and has started the process of removal from the energy dependence of Moscow. This makes Europe’s commitment an inevitable pillar of a possible peace strategy.
3626	7	Here, invoking diplomacy does not mean imagining unlikely solutions. It appears frankly illusory the perspective of a peace built on the agreement between America and China, putting Europe at the corner. It is more realistic to think about a re-establishment of dialogue between Washington and Moscow, with an important role of the European Chancellors and the European Union itself. This is not an impossible scenario, although at the moment the war on the ground makes everyone pessimistic.
3626	9	And pessimistic is to say little, as it has been articulated with lightness, for some time on this side, the discussion of the nuclear apocalypse. But it is precisely in the threshold of irrationality that we must at all costs trace the possible “controoffensive” of political rationality. The West may be afraid of the holocaust, but Russia, responsible for the terrible first blow, would be called to suffer the consequences. The impellent need for peace, even more than hopefully due to good feelings, goes to the edge of this tremendous awareness of the damage of the atomic option.
3626	11	Putin must not rely on the division of the West and Europe. It should not be misleading that the force allows him to win the pride of the Ukrainian people. It must not rely, but must not rely, on the belief that the Europeans’ “song of peace” moves beyond the boundaries of reason, a prisoner of an instinct of moral and psychological devotion. True peace, however urgent, can only be achieved by the defense and reaffirmation of a sacred principle of respect for that independence of peoples and nations to support the order of secure and stable international relations.
3627	1	The objectives of the gas war
3627	3	The sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipes is a move that penalizes and destabilizes the countries of the European Union and benefits the United States both economically and geostrategically. In the face of the heavy consequences of this terrorist act and the sanctions against Russia, we need to mobilize us to ask for Italy’s withdrawal from the war.
3627	5	The war in Ukraine is imperversal without the exclusion of strikes, so it’s true that even nuclear option is no longer a taboo and it’s talking about it, to get us used to the terrible idea. It is a conflict fought on many levels, from the military to the media (with the relative propaganda), from the supply of weapons of the latest generation to Ukraine to thousands of contractors, forgiveness volunteers, operating for months under the flag of the Ukrainian army, from the cyber-space war to the real space, through satellite recognition, from the massive use of intelligence, to sanctions that play a decisive role and whose consequences are suffered primarily by the European Union (EU) populations.
3627	7	The novelty is that at the end of September there was the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2, made to bypass, transiting through the Baltic Sea, countries not just friends of Russia (Baltic countries, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Ukraine) and so to make the supply of gas to European countries, especially to Germany, independent of any rejects of such countries. We refer to this article that is among the most documented among those out.
3627	9	However, few know that North Stream 1 was closed by Russia at the beginning of September, due to the impossibility – due to the sanctions – of carrying out indispensable maintenance, while North Stream 2, capable of transporting 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year, was not yet in operation, always due to the war. These gas pipes depended on the supply of gas to the EU countries at decisively affordable prices for buyers, due to old trade agreements suspended after the Russian intervention in Ukraine, always following well-known sanctions.
3627	11	A lot has been said and written about sabotage. We have even read light news of a earthquake or other geological event of which experts don’t report any trace.
3627	13	Sweden and Denmark claim that the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipeline is a consequence of a precise plot. The aim, in our opinion, is to further feed the escalation and to promote the achievement of the true goals of this war.
3627	15	Of sabotage, out of any discussion or reasonable doubt, we must speak as of the ecological consequences derived from the exit of gas from the Baltic Sea to confirm that in war we use all the means necessary for victory, including environmental devastations. Thus, war acts against Russia are also carried out using sanctions and the sabotage of gas pipes. This is how in the new phase of the conflict a new front is opened in which the energy and submarine communication infrastructures enter into play directly with the introduction in the Baltic of a form of Brinksmanship, a practice to seek to obtain an advantage, pushing forward dangerous situations.
3627	17	Every means is used to extend the war by directly involving the Western countries that are already strongly invited through the sending of weapons, sanctions and the next annexations to the NATO of Finland and Sweden.
3627	19	But we must also talk about a silently conducted economic war by the United States against the EU countries. The objective of the sanctions and the terrorist act is obvious. It wants to definitively break the economic bond between Russia and Germany, already compromised with the shipment of weapons to Ukraine, and make the energy supply of European countries depend on other suppliers with a double advantage for the United States.
3627	21	Economically, the U.S. appears among the leading alternative suppliers of gas and oil and are therefore benefited by the sanctions, at a time when its foreign accounts are strongly deficit. Furthermore, as U.S. companies will pay for energy products in the amount of about eight percent of what they are forced to pay for the European ones, there will be a significant dismantling of the manufacturing system in the old continent, with companies moving to the U.S.
3627	23	There is then a advantage of geostrategic order, as war and sanctions obstruct an Eurasian integration, which the States fear like the devil.
3627	25	The energy issue is an active part of this conflict [1]. On the other hand, the sources are wasted on the statements of authoritative U.S. political personalities that defend those gasdots or even threaten their suppression.
3627	27	That the target is not only Russia, it is demonstrated by the fact, absolutely predictable, that that country will not passively undergo the sanctions, but is building trade relations with other partners such as India, China and nations nearby and therefore will be mainly the EU countries to face the economic tsunami and social disaster, with companies that without assistance will close the bats and masses of workers in the integration cash. In addition, the generalized recharge of bills will precipitate in poverty many families, forced to choose whether to eat or warm up. It is also necessary to consider the severe environmental consequences due to the need to install rigassificators or even nuclear power plants.
3627	29	Another important element is that, beyond the proclamations of facade solidarity, the EU is disappearing and each country is seeking its own solutions, with Hungary which has clearly disappeared and the other countries seeking to address the problem with substantial aid to, aid that by European rules would even be prohibited as they violate the sacred taboo of competition. But in this generous and affanced extension of aid, you will be saved who can spend more. Germany, for example, has already announced a kind of antirincare megascude of €200 billion and will thus increase its margin of advantage over the most fragile and indebted countries, gaining market shares at their expense. One of those that will be able to put us much less financial resources is Italy.
3627	31	The scenarios that some called ironicly apocalyptic are becoming real, with a military escalation orchestrated by Biden that will have negative impacts on the European economies, on developing countries, which depend on grain supplies from Russia and Ukraine, and on a Western public opinion unable to capture the close link between economic crisis and war. All in the framework of an internal conflict in the area of the countries of advanced capitalism, despite the lucky news of a cohesive Europe and a cohesive western blockade.
3627	33	And then the word of order “out of Italy from war” becomes realistic and a political goal for which it is worth mobilizing, also opposing the militarization of the territories on the altar of the expansionist sights of the NATO and its strategic goals.
3628	1	“Putin’s arsenal is almost empty.” Factory and Logistics in Crisis
3628	3	count the missiles, save the artillery strikes, the bombs, the missiles. To raise from the back of the Russian soldier a precious protective cover that has never been missed, since the time of the counteroffensive of the Second World War, decisive in Chechnya as in Syria. If the accuracy – so sought by Putin’s doctrine that he had pointed on the few yet very effective hypersonic missiles – has never been a highlight feature of the Soviet (first) and Russian (after) strategy, the fire of saturation has always been a constant, a panacea. What allowed the slow advanced continued until August, after the resistance of Ukraine had cancelled every age of war lamp. But now with the Russian logistics reduced to lighting and with the factory of the country that, even thanks to the so underestimated sanctions, have a lack of all high-tech products, the cover, Moscow, had to take it.
3628	5	The signs of this drastic change of prospects have been under the eyes of analysts for weeks. They were summarized by Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of one of the British intelligence agencies (the Gchq, similar to the American NSA, who is engaged in spying and computer counter-spying). Fleming intervening at the annual security conference of the Royal United Services Institute anticipated to believe that the costs of war for Russia – both in terms of people and equipment – are “concerting,” since the first conquests were cancelled by Kiev, which is rebounding the situation against the “existent” Russian forces.
3628	7	"“We know, and the Russian commanders on the field know, that their supplies and ammunition are getting exhausted.” From here the strictly military assessment. Referring then to Putin, Fleming emphasized that, “after the little internal dialectic, his decision-making process has proved imperfect. It is a high-performance strategy that is leading to strategic assessment errors.” The fact that he believes is now under the eyes of the Russian people, as demonstrated by flights and disertions. Without entering the political space, where considerations are more random, the material data that comes from the battlefield is quite clear. For example, the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute of Singapore, which carefully monitored Russian long-range attacks, emphasized that now the use of precision missiles is residual. They mostly use old weapons with attacks thought mostly to have ""moral bombing"" effects on civilians."
3628	9	But the situation is very similar to the real front. Moscow would “burn” from 40 to 60 thousand ammunition of all kinds a day during the high-intensity combat operations, to drop to about 24 thousand in day-to-day stages. A huge number, which requires a full-rule war production. It should be added that the high-precision systems supplied to the Ukrainians from the West, have made screws of the Russian ammunition deposits. During the pre-war period, Russia produced approximately 1.7 million missiles a year. A quantity that can support the pace of the conflict. The palliative choice was to buy ammunition and drones from Iran and Korea, countries that traditionally went on to wheel of supplies made in Russia. Zelensky told the G7 that Putin would order more than 2,400 kamikaze drones to Tehran, after the thousands already destroyed by Kiev.
3628	11	It is a paradox. But he is not the only one. In many areas of Russian retreat is finished in the hands of Ukrainian means and materials perfectly usable. Some analysts estimated that the Ukrainians received almost more means, though of doubtful quality, from the Russians than from the West. Measures that often without lifting the famous “Z” were equipped with Western transponder to be recognized by friendly fire and throw into chaos the occupants. Of course, as in every war, the problems are not on one side. Even the West begins to make accounts with the shrinking stocks and the need to raise production. This was stated by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The difference is that the West is able to do so.
3629	1	The war in Ukraine puts the Europe of the Fatherland into crisis
3629	3	The intergovernmental vision has been unsuitable to address energy and military emergencies
3629	5	When you throw a hole into the staircase, you put on the waves that you don’t know where you stop. The Russian aggression of Ukraine is producing unpredictable waves within the European Union (EU). This aggression is throwing consolidated balances, both on the political and public policy level. Putin is forcing the EU to review its security policies (energy, environmental, military), but also the political balance (between the main parties) on which they were based. I explain.
3629	7	After the end of the Cold War, the EU consolidated itself through the convergence of two political families, the Christian-Democratic and the Social-Democratic. A political balance that replicated, in Brussels, that practiced in Berlin. For thirty years, the two families have formed the European political center, the area that governed the monetary integration process and stabilized the economic integration process.
3629	9	Despite the sovereign jump made with the creation of the European Central Bank, the European political center has finished performing its functions according to an increasingly intergovernmental vision. After the unification in 1990, Germany has gradually abandoned its sovereign (ex, federal) vision of the integration process, to make its own the intergovernmental vision of French culture. In the intergovernmental vision, integration progresses through voluntary coordination between national governments, which continue to be the pillars of the EU. The logic of voluntary coordination satisfied the interests of the big countries, but also calmed the fears of the small countries (for which the veto power constituted the life insurance). This intergovernmental vision made it possible to differentiate between different European policy schemes (such as the Eurozone or Schengen), just because integration was based on politically voluntary agreements and not (as in the single market) on legislatively binding measures. In fact, in the single market there was no differentiation (as the British had to notice), while there was differentiation in security policies (military, economic, territorial).
3629	11	But the context has changed. First came the pandemic and then the war in Ukraine, with their consequences. The intergovernmental vision of the European political center has been discussed. It could not be the individual national governments to take charge of post-pandemic recovery, nor could it be the individual national governments to take charge of energy and military security. If a problem has a European scale, it cannot receive a national response. This is where the asshole has fallen. The intergovernmental vision had not built enough central capacities (in Brussels) to address common problems, while it had continued to strengthen national capacities (in individual capitals). This is why the EU is delayed in responding to the energy crisis. Faced with the inadequacy of the European political center, the search for new political balances has been put into motion. to the left and right.
3629	13	On the left, consider the speech held by social-democratic chancellor Olaf Scholz at the University of Carolina in Prague on August 29 and the response of French President Emmanuel Macron on September 1 following. Scholz confirms the turn (Zeitenwende) of his government in the energy, defense and trade policies, joining Macron’s proposal to build a European sovereignty. But it does not clarify what to mean for sovereignty, neither does Macron, unless repeating that the EU must act “in concert”. But how can we act in concert when the EU member states have different interests? To have a European energy (or defence, or border control) policy, the EU needs to be equipped with autonomous capacities and resources. We need to go beyond the intergovernmental EU, but in what direction? Right, consider the recent positions of the Christian-Democrats of Manfred Weber. Forced to the opposition of the Social Democrats in Germany and Spain, they are looking for new allies among the European Nationalist Conservatives (guided by the Polish anti-Russian party Prawo i Sprawiedliwość of Jarosław Kaczyński and presided by Giorgia Meloni). Of course, the German Weber could never open to the extremists of “Identity and Democracy” (where the German nationalists of Alternative für Deutschland sit, but also the Philosoph League of Matteo Salvini). In turn, the Ukrainian war is pushing the European Conservatives out of their “Europe of the Fathers” ideology, to open themselves to more institutional forms of cooperation, in the EU and in the Atlantic Alliance. After all, the Europe of the Fatherland cannot stop Putin, nor liberate the EU from energy dependence on Moscow. Italy after September 25 may be the laboratory of this new European right, Atlantic and Anti-Russian, which is therefore incompatible with the Russian League (which will have to be placed at the margins of the decision-making process). The meeting between the two right parties may take place on an intergovernmental vision of the EU, thus ensuring the differentiation between the various application of the rule of law by the Member States (as the Poles claim). Is it acceptable for the heirs of Angela Merkel?
3629	15	In short, the war in Ukraine is forcing the EU to revise its political balances and the policies on which it is built. It will not be a painless process, but backward it is difficult to get back.
363	1	The Covid has not disappeared, let’s prepare.
363	3	It seems really surreal to me that among the many words that fly during this election campaign, the word Covid is almost entirely inexistent. It’s probably because this 2022 is the hotest year ever, that’s since we started measuring the planet’s temperature, and this makes us reflect on the great changes that await us as well as the forecast for a cold winter (what?) No one of us thought we had to face.
363	5	In this sea of uncertainty and developing scenarios, however, there is a certainty and that the Sars-CoV-2 with the first colds will begin to circulate more vividly and the focolai will multiply, with the effect that most citizens will develop a light form, some more heavy and some other will end up in the hospital. Some of them will die.
363	7	The health authorities have done a lot to a good level of vaccine coverage and thanks to this titanic commitment, the worst has been avoided. Now they recommend vaccination with the fourth dose for fragile and over 60 as well as ending the vaccination cycle (third dose) to those who did not. Why? Because the rate of reinfection is very high: just think how many people tell us that they’ve taken it twice.
363	9	This virus is an unknown youth: otherwise it has only been with us for a few years. It started its endemization cycle causing even a summer wave that surprised observers and made a lot to discuss experts. The influenza, for example, reappears punctual every year during autumn-winter either between October and February in this hemisphere, or from May to September in the other hemisphere, is so: respiratory viruses pursue the cold. Here, let’s also say that as soon as you get back more closed the respiratory viruses will hit our receptors. The Covid will reappear, and with it also other viruses, including a new strain of influence that now in the absence of maskers and lockdown, can return to its joyful pre-andemic life characterized by seasonal epidemic galopates.
363	11	Is there a recurrence to be expected? I really believe that yes. How serious? This depends on each of us. Here there are no absolute rules that can be applied to the tapet and make the Covid, influenza and the rest disappear. Here we have to use the intelligence we are equipped with and use the things we have learned during these pandemic years.
363	13	Without wanting to get into any controversy, I would suggest to keep the mask in your pocket or pocket and put it if suddenly it is in the midst of a lot of cracked people. We take up the locals. We are a little further away from each other. We try not to leave the house when we’re not well and if we need it, we use the mask.
363	15	As for vaccines now we know that both those used so far and the up-to-date vaccine with the Omicron variants are effective in protecting against the variants in circulation now. This is a good news and however, to be effective the vaccine must be administered as by recommendations, and the numbers are not so encouraging.
363	17	I think it would really be an unforgivable sin if during the hard winter 2023 scheduled as the winter “in the cold” a wave of very contagious respiratory disease that keeps people home because they are sick or are infectious. The source of the unforgivable sin is that this would happen more likely if we don’t have the desire or interest to get vaccinated, we don’t give righteousness to health authorities or we don’t remember to keep a pack of masks in the machine or in the bag, or even if we often get in close contact with people outside our bull.
363	19	In short, we already know the importance of some virtuous behaviors that mitigate the impact of respiratory infections. Let us use them and learn to really live with these invisible enemies, respecting them and thus cutting their legs.
3630	1	Is Greta Thunberg changing idea about nuclear energy? Better than coal
3630	3	“If they are already active, I think it would be a mistake to turn off the nuclear power plants to rely on coal.” Greta Thunberg, the Swedish activist face of the environmentist movement Fridays for Future, is aware that her claims will cause discussion but repeats the concept several times. Interviewed by the German broadcaster Ard, she intervened in the energy debate that has dominated the public debate in Germany for months.
3630	5	Greta Thunberg and the Gas Emergency
3630	7	The interview will go on a wave on Wednesday, but television journalist Sandra Maischberger has anticipated an extract in a Twitter post. It is not surprising that Thunberg finds a bad idea to bet on coal again. It is surprising that instead you consider better using nuclear power plants. This is the case that in Germany it is still in operation.
3630	9	In essence, Thunberg says it is a big mistake to shut down German power plants to return to fossil fuels. This is what many analysts have agreed on, but they have highlighted how the young activist’s position has changed compared to some time ago.
3630	11	But did the activist change his idea about nuclear weapons?
3630	13	In fact, in 2019, in a post posted on Facebook, the young environmentalist, although recognizing that nuclear energy could represent a small part of “a new zero-carbon energy solution”, largely dismissed it. More recently, a few months ago, on the occasion of the vote on the introduction of gas and nuclear energy among the “green” sources in the European Parliament, a tweet referred to the use of methane and atom as “fake solutions.”
3630	15	The Unknown, the Unknown
3630	17	The German government’s energy strategy predicts the rise of coal power plants to reduce electricity production through gas. Robert Habeck, Deputy Chancellor and Minister of Economy and Climate Protection, has decided to leave two of the three nuclear power plants still in operation until April 2023. A emergency reserve for the winter.
3630	19	But Germany has made a plan to become independent from nuclear power: the last three nuclear power plants remaining active should be closed by the end of 2022. It should be that, instead, before the 2011 disaster in the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, Germany pointed on nuclear power: with 17 reactors, from which the country received about a quarter of its electricity.
3630	21	Renewables first and foremost
3630	23	Greta Thunberg, of course, does not go back on renewables: in this direction we have to go, more than think of any new investment in fossil energy. But in the current scenario, nuclear energy, if already installed, can also be a resource.
3630	25	The biggest concern at this time is that the difficult international situation with the gas crisis becomes an alibi to slow down the energy transition. And consider a return to the fossil.
3631	1	Biden Choc: “About Abortion? “The poor need it” / “Private Son of a Healthy Existence”
3631	3	Joe Biden’s shock speech on abortion: “The poor need it. The private son of a healthy existence is a lack of dignity for the parents.”
3631	5	Joe Biden's Choc Discourse on Abortion
3631	7	Speaking in a speech on the future of health in the United States outside the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden returned again to the historic judgment of the Supreme Court that in recent months abolished the “right to abortion” sanctioned by the Constitution, thus abolishing the previous “Roe vs Wade” judgment of 1973. Catholic convinced, but equally convinced pro-choice, Biden is committing his government to counter as much as possible at the federal level the judgment of the Court and in many occasions he has launched against the pro-life announcing a “extreme law” that will bring legalized abortion even well beyond the previously established limit.
3631	9	But in the speech held in recent days, Biden has launched a surreal – we say it with all the respect possible, but we don’t think of another more appropriate term – declaration about the fact that the poor have the right to abortion. Or rather, surreal is the motivation attributed to this statement (of itself legitimate although questionable): “How in God’s name you look at that child – knowing that you can’t afford it, you don’t have the insurance, you don’t have a way to safeguard it?”
3631	11	Biden: “Powers are out of the abortion.” The “Crocata” Pro-Choice of the Catholic President
3631	13	Joe Biden’s words have led to discussion and not a little, and nothing is worth the attempt to further explanation given immediately after that statement to the White House by the President himself: regarding being poor, “My father would say that not only deprives that child of a healthy existence, but deprives a parent of his dignity.” The focus on the dignity of the child and the parents to explain the need to have the abortion legalized: a motivation and a logical consequence that really escapes from rationality.
3631	15	Let’s mean, everyone – including Biden of course, or Nancy Pelosi even more “party” on the pro-aborto front – has the right to support his pro-choice intention and thanks to God there is still somewhere in the world the freedom of speech in this sense. The problem, however, is of double nature in the President’s case: in primis, argumenting that for the good of the future child it is prevented from being born (he is killed by pharmacological abortion or by intervention, in fact) is at least, right, surreal. Secondly, as the “Catholic Vote” portal that has broadcast the video of Biden’s statement, to discuss is the fact that the President conceives himself as a practicing Catholic: “Joe Biden needs a memorial. Catholics cannot support abortion. The point.” Biden’s “cross” pro-aborto has long divided and not little the same American Catholic Church that in fact in some of its components demanded that the President of the United States no longer be granted the Eucharist as continuous and impertered his commitment to a law and practice condemned by the Social Doctrine of the Church of Christ.
3632	1	Greta opens to nuclear power and the left remains orphan of its paladine
3632	3	They are firefighters and they are firefighters. In popular dicts, the truth is often hidden, and these words fall on a pencil to describe Greta Thunberg’s evolution. If it continues so, in a few years we will find the already paladine of the environment, the girl who accused the powerful of doing only “bla, bla, bla”, to support the fossil sources. A hypothesis that today may seem implausible but that, in the light of the recent nuclear declaration of the young Swedish activist, is not excluded, can be realised in the coming years.
3632	5	At a surprise, Greta Thunberg expressed its favour to nuclear energy and, referring to the situation in Germany, said: “If I am still in operation, I think it would be a mistake to shut down the nuclear power plants and turn to carbon again.” It is a good sense, which has been surprised because it has been pronounced by those who have always brought forward an ideological vision on environmental issues. The current energy crisis (defined by the wrong political choices made in the past years following the approach incarnated by Greta Thunberg), however, imposes a bath of reality also to the paladines of liberal environmentalism. More than a real conversion to reasonable positions, Thunberg’s statement could be stated by a simple calculation: the energy crisis, which is falling on families and, has determined a change of sensitivity on environmental and energy issues and people are less likely to hear theoretical speeches but want concrete answers and solutions.
3632	7	Time for idealized environmentalists
3632	9	So, the icon of the Fridays for Future movement, referring to the German government’s plan to reactivate coal plants in order to reduce the supply of gas to the electricity network, said it’s “a bad idea to score on coal.” Thunberg stressed that there are alternatives to coal to start “from renewables”. And, at that point, charged by a journalist about the announcement of the Minister of Economy, Robert Habeck, to keep at least two of the three nuclear power plants still in operation, he said referring to a possible disruption of the power plants: “It depends on what will happen.”
3632	11	"From here the phrase with which in a single blow Greta deprived the paladines of the environmentalist left of his icon and at the same time dropped the nuclear: ""If nuclear power plants are in operation I think it would be a mistake to close them privileging coal."""
3632	13	It’s a hard time for idealized environmentalists: they’ve seen years of propaganda overwhelming with the consequences of the ecological transition, now they see their own heroine making a turn-to-face for the nuclear. He wished that it was not time for them to return with their feet to the ground.
3633	1	Ukraine, war between left leaders for peace marches
3633	3	"There are many protests that call for peace in Ukraine. Many of these, however, paradoxically become a cause of division. At least among the parties who choose or not to join you. And so if on Thursday, in front of the Russian embassy, the PD and More Europe will participate in the sit-in promoted by Marco Bentivogli and a group of associations, entitled “There is no true peace without truth. There is no truth without freedom,” Giuseppe Conte and the M5S, instead, will not be there. We are preparing, however, to join the demonstration that for the middle of November (12 or 19) Arci, Acli and other associations intend to organize. In the meantime there is the mobilization that from 21 to 23 October Italian Peace and Disarmament Network, Arci, Acli and others have promoted in various Italian squares. It is not yet clear which party will join. Then there is the Sant'Egidio Community, which promoted an event entitled ""Meeting of Dialogue and Prayer for Peace Between World Religions"" which will take place in Rome from 23 to 25 October: President Sergio Mattarella, Emmanuel Macron, Mohamed Bazoum, President of Niger and, in closure, Pope Francis will participate. It is not finished. On October 28, the Campania Region launched a peace initiative, to which the Cgil will join. A second, then, will be held on November 5 “for work and peace”, launched by Maurizio Landini, secretary of the Cgil, from the square of the People last Saturday."
3633	5	“Five in a few hours, and a few weeks...” Kherson, the Russian collapse
3633	7	The different points of view
3633	9	"A flower of events that gives voice to a widespread feeling, but shows different accents in looking at what is happening in Ukraine. Who more emphasizes the aggression by Russia, who the demand for peace by both sides. And so the squares end to be divided. In particular, they divide Pd and M5S, increasingly competing in representing the left. And in putting a chapel to the Pacific galaxy. The first event, in chronological order, will take place on Thursday. It is called for the “immediately ceasefire”, the “stop to the nuclear escalation”, an “international commission” to verify the truth about the crimes that have occurred in Ukraine, the “recognition of freedom of speech to the Russian dissidents” and the “retiration of the Russian troops”. There will be the PD. Not the M5S. “It seems to me,” explains Matteo Orfini, “that by some there is the will to use peace for an instrumental division for internal purposes.” The Conte? “He’s a transformist, there’s nothing honest in his positions.” And so thinks Bentivogli, the promoter of the sit-in: “There is a distinction between aggressor and attacked, there is no equidistance,” while “the ideological pacifism that is based on the wrong hides goals far from peace.” As for Conte, “there is now the pacifist’s clothes,” but “for military expenses, it seems to me that he has already changed his mind at least once.” The head of the M5S, in any case, has already announced that it will not be on Thursday. It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do. “We will participate,” he said yesterday, “in the great national demonstration for peace in preparation. We will take part without flags. We do not want to put any political chapel on an opportunity for all citizens to express their concerns for this military escalation and to invoke a turning toward a peace negotiation.” Meanwhile, Carlo Calenda launches his demonstration in Milan, against that of Conte that would be ""for the resignation of Ukraine."""
3633	11	The note
3633	13	"Rome's mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, also takes the distances from Conte: ""The demonstrations for peace are always a positive fact, but that whoever has government responsibility must always distinguish between whoever agrees and whoever agrees. There were ambiguities in the public debate.” In the chaos of the squares, a Pd note tries to put clarity and to avoid divisions: “The Pd’s line on the war is clear, clear, from the beginning. We participate and support any initiative that aims to peace and that at the same time, clearly, does not present ambiguity on the responsibilities of the aggressor, i.e. Russia of Vladimir Putin.” And the same Enrico Letta specified that there is pacifism and pacifism: “We participate in all initiatives that want to reiterate the need for peace and of course all those in which the signal is given that there is a clear responsibility from Russia.”"
3634	1	Putin and Kim Jong Un. The nuclear threat is contagious.
3634	3	Pyongyang headed the tactical missiles is a revolt of the Kremlin intimidations
3634	5	The recent North Korean missile tests were not simple provocations, but a real exercise for the use of tactical nuclear weapons against U.S. and South Korean targets. Pyongyang has announced this in a statement on the 77th anniversary of the founding of the Korean Labour Party. The news, which follows an unprecedented intensification of missile tests – including a medium-range ballistic missile that surpassed Japan last Monday – is very important for two reasons. First of all, it reminds us that the North Korean threat is there to remain: little has changed after the negotiation and dialogue attempt launched by former South Korean President Moon Jae-in and after the misleading and confused attempts of Donald Trump. Kim Jong-un continues to be protected by his two major neighbors, Russia and China, and the other yesterday the Foreign Ministry said it is America to put Pyongyang in the conditions of sitting at the table of negotiations, not the opposite. A complete removal of the responsibilities of the crisis.
3634	7	But there is another point, much more worrying. It is the first time that North Korea says that it has plans to use on the field tactical nuclear weapons against South Korea and America – the two major enemies, those of the 1950-53 Korean War. It is important to emphasize that the North Korean nuclear rhetoric reappears just as from the other side of the world, in Europe, Vladimir Putin uses the nuclear threat to try to stop the counteroffensive Ukraine and divide the Western coalition. Russia is trying to send the message that the most terrible threat, that of Biden’s “Nuclear Armageddon”, works, and now the danger is that of emulation. North Korea, among the countries of the non-allineated group, is the one to have tests and technology to increase the threat, and is the first to try it.
3635	1	Brussels has to decide on gas.
3635	3	Why European uncertainty is at risk of favoring nationalists and putinians
3635	5	There would be good technical reasons, to support the Italian proposal on the price head: that which even yesterday, Roberto Cingolani supported in front of his European colleagues, finally obtaining – and it was not an estimated result, given the premises – the draft of a new letter, signed this time by all the energy ministers of the Member States, to ask the European Commission for a reform of the European gas market. And there are good reasons, then, also to think that the most appropriate way is another, and that is, that of the Energy Sure. And it’s not a case, of the rest, that Mario Draghi has held up so far, ready to resume both the plan of his minister Cingolani and the hypothesis heated by European Commissioner Gentiloni. For in fact, the only option that would have no reason would be the outbreak of the expectation, and the uncertainty, of the EU.
3635	7	For a year – it started even before the outbreak of the war – European leaders have been discussing common supply and warehouses, the single market, and then the roof to the price of gas, only to quote the main issues. Therefore, it is necessary to find that in the phrase “decisions taken”, after more than twelve months, there is this: nothing. And this is not just a terrible step back from the “European moment,” which led to the Next Generation Eu, which would even deny the thesis – even that luxury missing too much, to be seen – that only in the crises the EU advances.
3635	9	This lack of resolutory, rather than of solidarity, represents something even worse: it is a legitimation of the nationalist temptations that spread in the various Member States, of whom it says it is appropriate to “do by itself”: even because, with the duration of the expensive bill, this logic would put in danger also the compassion of the European front in favour of Ukrainian resistance. And this, for Ursula von der Leyen, and with her for all the heads of state and government, would be a terrible mistake.
3635	11	GDP and lower gas costs force Meloni to run
3635	13	The Istat certifies a 0.5 percent growth in the last quarter (thanks Draghi). In the meantime, Nomisma says that the recharge for the next bills will be 5 percent, compared to a 70’s forecast. Translated: a treasury for the new government
3636	1	There is a dialogue between Washington and Moscow. Beijing is encouraging. And there are no other roads (C. Meier)
3636	3	"""The Russian side is ready to consider the proposal for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden at the margins of the next G20 summit, if it will be welcomed."" The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this during the 60 Minutes wave broadcast on the federal channel Pervyj."
3636	5	“We have repeated several times that we never refuse meetings. If there is a proposal, we will take it into consideration,” the diplomat said at the question on the prospects of such a G20 summit.
3636	7	Lavrov said: “If many believe there is a sign that Biden is ready for a meeting, I think it is based solely on ‘we’ll see. Probably it’s more about journalistic speculations than realpolitik,” Lavrov added.
3636	9	The G20 summit, which will be held on the Indonesian island of Bali on 15-16 November, has been confirmed and could actually be an opportunity to work on a ever-needed distancing policy.
3636	11	The EU is in the wrong policy of sanctions.
3636	13	The EU member states are discussing the introduction of a new, ninth package of sanctions against Russia. This was by an anonymous source from the European Council on Tuesday.
3636	15	“Yes, we’re already discussing a new package of sanctions against Russia after the further escalation we’ve seen on October 10,” a official said.
3636	17	Asked if a roof for the price of Russian gas was taken into consideration, the diplomat replied, “No, it has not yet been discussed.”
3636	19	According to the source, any ninth package of penalties could include both economic and individual restrictive measures. For example, EU countries are discussing the possible confiscation of frozen goods to Russian legal entities and natural persons, but, as the diplomat emphasizes, “it is a complex issue from the legislative point of view.” “In this stage it’s too early to say more,” he concluded.
3636	21	The G7 virtual summit on Ukraine will be held at 14 a.m., with Volodymyr Zelensky participating. Meanwhile, Turkey calls on Russia and Kiev for a ceasefire “as soon as possible,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a television interview.
3636	23	China also expressed concern over the latest developments in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which saw Moscow troops launching missiles on Ukrainian cities.
3636	25	“We are concerned about the development of the situation and we invite stakeholders to adequately resolve the differences with dialogue and consultations,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in a daily briefing, without expressing specific condemnations. China, he added, “is willing to collaborate with the international community to continue to play a constructive role in relieving tensions.”
3637	1	No games with the country
3637	3	5 minutes to read.
3637	5	We see the struggle between circles of public bureaucracy and the main Italian institutions that faced with a manifest will of Meloni to make competent choices, starting from the economy, who know how to do things in the slope traced by Draghi and reassure Europe, the ECB and markets pulling out of the parties, cannot do better than divide into counterparty factions and do not contribute to promoting choices as weighing as necessary. We would like to summarize to all that the quality and cohesion of the composition of the government team is the indispensable premise to cross a hell circle that sees us already under observation of the major rating agencies even before the government is settled.
3637	7	We do not play with the country. We cannot allow it. We cannot make the belief that Meloni is a single woman in the command even before she has received the task of forming the government by the Head of State, Sergio Mattarella. There is not only the topic of the parties and the party leaders of the winning coalition who have not perceived the severity of the situation until the end, otherwise they would not cause the Draghi government to fall. There is not only the further problem that have not changed the idea yet today with a global situation of high rates that binds us hands and feet and with the proven proof provided by the British conservative government that has made jump for air reputation, pounds and public accounts only announcing the will to make the copy of the Italian flat tax of the duo Salvini-Berlusconi.
3637	9	No, to all this, in a framework of Italian real economy stopped by the crisis of the rest of the world and by the unbearable weight of the putinian rejection on the gas, the problem of the struggle between circles of the public bureaucracy and the main Italian institutions that faced with a manifest will of the Meloni to make competent choices, starting from the economy, who know how to do things in the slope traced by Draghi and reassure Europe, the ECB and markets attending out of the parties, cannot do better than divide themselves into counterparty factions and do not contribute to favouring choices as weighing as necessary.
3637	11	We would like to remind all of us that the country is at stake. That the quality and cohesion of the composition of the government team is the indispensable prerequisite to cross a hell round that sees us already under observation of the major rating agencies even before the government is settled. We’re scattered if we repeat the usual scenario of the usual Italy of legions of half-takes of bureaucracy and politics that premise and obtain government and subgovernment positions without even having understood what it means to do before Christmas the most difficult budget law in recent history – there’s a treasure left in heritage by Draghi, but there’s a mountain of resources to find winning the European gas battle – and implement all the reforms and investments agreed with Brussels within the National Resurrection and Resilience Plan.
3637	13	It means not even to have understood that leading in the time predicted to the strictly executive phase the reform process initiated by Draghi bringing to regime an effective change in the operationality of the ministerial and territorial bureaucracies is the pre-condition to continue to incass the European funds of the Pnrr and have the certainty that the ECB shield will really take up as soon as the speculation already on the ground will try to return to bet against Italy.
3637	15	We have understood or not that among the targets that await us at the hole there is the actual opening of the plants when they are not yet able to close the bands due to the price rise? We have understood or not that we need to accelerate on the ability to do things as the Draghi government would do and how did Meloni properly emphasize claiming it as a priority? Do we understand or not that tax delegation should be done as well as the law of competition? What are all commitments undertaken with regular contracts signed and signed on the honor of the Italian Republic? We have understood or not that the political leadership of key ministries for the economy is needed by people able to study the dossiers and not to make propaganda announcing what will never go?
3637	17	It requires a spirit of countries that demonstrate love and respect for Italy other than announcing Aventini alive. It requires a collective solidarity to overcome the efforts of the first female Prime Minister of the Italian Republic either because the Italians wanted it or because the moment does not allow political speculation and mediation to decline. What happened with the irrepetible phrases of the French minister is truly enlightening. It allows us to talk about the prime minister in the sin of our home as it would ever be done against conservatives like Boris Johnson and Liz Truss who have done in England more disasters in two of how many mistakes all those who have preceded them may have committed.
3637	19	We are allowed to do so when the exercise of responsibility carried out by Meloni from the day after the elections shows the exact opposite. No one must be allowed to treat Italy in this way because we are not the Republic of the Banana and the traced slurry is strong and requires the will of all to continue staying firmly anchored with the idea of a new Europe and a new Italy.
3637	21	We want to say it all. It is true that to put things in place, the Head of State thought about us with the strength of his authority and that he made Meloni very good to make his voice heard. There was a lack of one, however, of the voice that is that of the most representative opposition that is in Italy that vice versa would have had to express its anger even before Mattarella took chapel. It is the same opposition that has not questioned one in the election campaign because it has forgotten the national interest and raised flags out of history. They are the same mistakes that do those circles of the great Italian bureaucracy that instead of running to give a hand to the country that needs it and to the prime minister in sin who has the humility and the intelligence to ask it, they make the war between them. It’s in the game, let’s stop making the usual toys. The seriousness of Italy regained by the action and method of work of the Draghi government is the most important reputational capital that our country has today to face the global recession season that for us is still today growth slowdown. At least let us all realize that the alternative to this path is the bar. To bet against the country are already in a lot of trouble if we open internal spots.
3637	23	The quality of information is an absolute good, which requires commitment, dedication, sacrifice. The Southern Daily is the product of this kind of coral work that absorbs us every day with the greatest passion and expertise possible.
3637	25	We have a precious good that we defend every day and that you can check every day. This precious good is called freedom. We have a flag that we don’t intend. This flag is that of a Midnight never supposed that claims the rewarded rights but knows and fulfills its duties.
3637	27	We count on you to preserve this free voice that wants to be the flag of the Midnight. It is the flag of Italy.
3638	1	Majority of Covid risk. A boom of positive.
3638	3	“Mathematical models tell us that there will be an increase in cases of covid by the end of November, with a maximum score of 90,000 cases. But proportionally the serious cases will be lower than in the past.” The virologist and health director of the Irccs Galeazzi, Fabrizio Pregliasco affirms his predictions on the rise of infections: “I hope that it is a wave, not a wave, because compared to the past there are more vaccinated and healed. Even though older and fragile people should still protect themselves with the fourth dose.” If the vaccine coverage remains low, he says, “there can’t be excluded” new closures: “It might be necessary again, we have to imagine them as hypotheses but we hope they will remain in the box.” This is the next internal branch of the future majority of government. Southeast is indicated in the possible resalute of the contagion covid the first test bank forining the balances between the allies.
3638	5	On the subject of restrictions, masks and vaccines, in the electoral campaign the central right reiterated compact no to all kinds of lockdown and above all to that “Speration” model ended in the mirino during the pandemic. But with some distinct, especially from inside Forza Italy, where different sensitivities coexist. This is the first time I’ve been able to do it, and I’ve been able to do it, and I’ve been able to do it. Carroccio in his electoral programme highlights that “for you to be convinced of the importance of diffused vaccination addressed in particular to the most fragile categories, such treatment should be offered to citizens without any further obligation, rather than by guaranteeing a broad information campaign that can accompany them in the most conscious choice possible, promoting first and foremost home care. There is no obligation to vaccinate against Covid-19, but information, promotion and recommendation for vaccination, in particular for risk age ranges and vulnerability situations. Full freedom of choice among the vaccines authorized by the EMA and the AIFA and references.” This is the first time I’ve been able to do it, and I’ve been able to do it. In the closure of the election campaign, Giorgia Meloni reiterated the concept: “Liberty also applies to how we intend to face the possible return of the pandemic: we will no longer accept that Italy is the experiment of applying the Chinese model to a western country.” More prudent Forza Italy that in the program provides a “update of pandemic plans”, and “structually adjustments”, but “without the compression of individual freedoms”. The head of Health of Forza Italy Andre Mandelli has repeatedly clarified: “Serves a campaign of information to citizens about the current state of therapies and vaccines, but the closing season is over. Forza Italy had suggested to Draghi to recover to the pandemic plans and we were always very careful to observe the measures when needed and to ask for reopenings when the epidemiological conditions allowed it.”
3638	7	More rigid the positions of some blue exposants during the Covid. This is the most important part of the world’s economy, and it is the most important part of the world’s economy. Initially, the name was made for health. Ronzulli had always declared himself in favour of the vaccination obligation for health staff and had submitted a ddl to extend the vaccination obligation to teachers. It is difficult that on the management of a possible rise of the infections Meloni and Salvini can accept mediations.
3639	1	War economy, weak leadership and cartels to support
3639	3	Those who are concerned about Europe should be concerned. Because the delay with which Brussels begins to seriously deal with the energy crisis, at least in its extreme dimension determined as a result of the Russian invasion war in Ukraine, indicates that in Europe there is a problem.
3639	5	Those who are concerned about Europe should be concerned. Because the delay with which Brussels begins to seriously deal with the energy crisis, at least in its extreme dimension determined as a result of the Russian invasion war in Ukraine, indicates that in Europe there is a problem. Probably there is a leadership problem, with a Commission that seems to pursue the events. Only now, it’s the news of today, maybe someone begins to understand that when you declare a war, even if only an economic war, you must be prepared to lead it or you must be prepared quickly to be there. Because it is not enough to get back on visits to Kiev or near the war zones to give substance to the idea of a united Europe in war effort. To conduct an economic war against Russia, the military being delegated to the Ukrainians, means to be prepared for a war economy, which means to be prepared to intervene on the functioning of organized markets for periods of peace. From Brussels came announcements about the times in which we should stop financing Russia by buying gas and oil, but it has not yet been given a response to those warning, such as the Italian government, that we had to prepare to avoid, or to contain, the paradoxical result of buying less gas or oil from Russia but at higher prices, and then with greater exchange for less products. Moreover, the time reduction of supply now appears to be more imposed by the Russian seller than by European buyers.
3639	7	But there is a political problem behind the technical debate on the need for a roof to the price of gas, to proceed to the “decoupling” between the determination of the price of gas and the price of electricity and to implement other possible direct interventions to stop the rise of the price of gas. The political problem is given by the fact that the interests are not equal among the countries that in this war are or should be on the same side. Interests are not equal due to the different configurations of economies and energy supplies; therefore, to reach an operational agreement it is necessary to take into account the problems of all. However, it should not be allowed to create spaces for particular enrichments, even if not illegal, typical of war economies. It is difficult, in fact, to make the populations of the European countries called to sacrifice that the rise in energy prices can produce enormous profits, as documented yesterday in this newspaper by David Tabarelli, to countries such as Norway and the United States that sell their gas to Europe, while being NATO countries committed like others to fight on the same front.
3639	9	The price expenditure that is putting on the knees increasing part of the production activities, as well as the households, depends in part on the dysfunction of the energy market, but in substance depends on the excess of demand compared to supply. This is why in war economies the area of administered prices is extended, where goods become low and the rising price no longer plays the physiological role of signal to make there are investments to reduce the shortage. The price head essentially means establishing that today gas prices are not playing this role and therefore an administrative measure is needed. The possibility of managing prices without producing more weaknesses depends on the ability to create a sustainable “cartridge” by the buyers and, therefore, avoid the competition by the buyers in the race to catch the scarce good. This is why the demand for national measures to establish a roof to the price of energy goods with an international market is not sustainable. In fact, a “cartridge” must be able to provide a monopoly power by the demand that can impose the price, whileining the convenience of the producers not to reduce the offer below that demand. Of course, there are complex technical aspects, but the substance is this. This is why it is unacceptable that there is no rapid proceeding to an agreement in Europe to form the “cartridge” of demand in the face of the quasi-monopoly, at least in the short term, Russian. The basis of the agreement for the constitution of the “cartel” cannot be only the economic convenience to join it, but it should be the common decision to conduct an economic war and thus to share its costs. It may also pose the problem of the role that the United States is playing, whose interest in keeping the alliance united should be more supported not only by the promises to increase the supply of liquid gas but to do so at acceptable prices. As to say, the perimeter of the “cartridge” of the supporters of the price head, at least in war, should go beyond the European Union. We are aware that it’s a private market, but we’re in war and market rules have been well violated until today because it’s exactly what happens in wars. Asking the government to deal with the emergency by acting nationally and increasing public debt is the opposite way, and it would be a weakness strategy.
3639	11	The Parliament seems to have reached a maximum agreement on the delegation law for the tax reform. The most common point is the need to reduce the direct tax pressure, i.e. the Irpef, on low average income classes. But with regard to the possible extent of this reduction, a topic that seems forgotten in the debate is that of the possible shift of the collection from direct taxes (Irpef) to indirect taxes (IVA), i.e. from the income of the productive factors, which in the case of the Irpef are essentially the income from work, as well as from pensions, to the taxation of consumption. The Minister Tremonti called this shift “from people to things”. It is a very strange forget that, in a period of shared europeism, a traditional European Commission recommendation is avoided. A recommendation whose foundation lies in the fact that this shift of the revenue favors growth at equality of total tax pressure. The reason is that the tax cuneo would be reduced, which enters the cost of production, resulting in a rise in net tax remunerations. But this shift of revenue would also be beneficial for growth because it causes a “tax assessment”, since the IVA does not increase exports, while it affects the consumption of goods and services imported in the same amount as those produced on the national territory. This will regain international competitiveness. In addition, it is not a case that in the globalized economy, to tax locally the profits of multinational companies, it is being assessed to take as a reference their sales in different countries. And also in the discussions on wealth taxation it is emphasized that personal wealth, in various ways legally or not legally hidden, reflect in the lifetime of the beneficiaries at the time of consumption.
3639	13	The important fact is that following this path would allow today a double or even triple reduction of the Irpef receipt on the middle-low income than it is discussed and this would facilitate the definition of the “methode” by which to reduce the direct taxation on the middle and middle-low income classes to a noticeable extent. There is to decide, in fact, “how” to operate the correction and its dimensions. In other words, there is, on the one hand, the problem of how to finance the Irpef collection reduction and on the other hand, the problem of defining the collection structure, the degree of progressivity and how to apply it. On this second point, the political debate focused on two possible well-described alternatives, as Paladini and Visco on the Sun recalled on June 30, in the best report presented in an audition to the Parliament by the Director-General of the Ministry of Finance of the Mef, Professor Fabrizia La Pecorella, and well studied in the same Department since 2019. The first option consists essentially in the reduction, from 5 to 3, of the number of rates applied for income dividends. The second hypothesis is to move to the so-called German model, i.e. to draw a continuous curve of marginal rates, which would substantially coincide with the actual average, to apply for each individual income level. Since we have already taken a position on this section in favour of this second alternative (15 August 2020), we reiterate the fundamental reasons for this. The main attractions of the German model are in its transparency and flexibility. Transparency for every income perceptor to know, without making personal calculations, what percentage of his income must be paid to the State, which is quite different from what is read in his marginal rate. The subject of who speaks of “algoritmic” or mathematical complication for determining the curve of the rates is foolish because the task of calculation is the tax administration, and it is not complicated because it is enough to decide which it should be, while the taxpayer would only be communicated the actual percentage of his income he must pay. In terms of flexibility, it should be considered from a double point of view. It allows you to target the income levels to benefit today with a reduction in revenue, accurately drawing the curve of progressivity, but it also allows you to easily gradually, in the future, fix the curve of rates to the desired level of income. In other words, it would be easy to move to higher levels of income the progressivity of the recovery required by the Constitution, as the balance of public finance will allow it and according to the discretionary political choices that are the basis of democracy. In any case, decided the method, the important thing is to gradually significantly reduce the tax pressure on medium and medium-low income. It has been said for decades, at least since the high inflation made the nominal, but not the real, revenue lower, with the result that the rates conceived for medium-high revenue ended up affecting also the medium-low. The debate on the fiscal drag, as the phenomenon was called, was intense but without significant effects. The hunger of tax throwing in the face of increasing public expenditure, unfortunately not for investments, has so far always placed this need for recovery correction in the list of good proposals.
364	1	Nuclear war, General Tricarico: “NATO is betrayed by member countries, Stoltenberg is cracking it and no negotiations”
364	3	"While the risk of an escalation of the war remains on the background, with the Russian nuclear threat continuing to allegate, analysts put on the plate the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance. “NATO has been betrayed by some member countries because the constitutional rules of the NATO have not been respected. It would be necessary to see the meetings of the Atlantic Committee” to understand “if there was a real concertation. I am sure that it has not been there,” says General Leonardo Tricarico, former head of state of Aeronautica, president of the Icsa Foundation and military adviser of three presidents of the Council, interviewed by Presa Diretta for the ""Nuclear Threat"" pointing in wave tomorrow at 21.25 on Rai3."
364	5	This is the only way to get rid of the weaknesses of the body.
364	7	The words of the general
364	9	On the responsibility of some NATO member countries that would have betrayed Article 4 of the Alliance – which says that decisions must be taken unanimously – Tricarico puts the finger on the secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, “who has played a negative role in all this matter, because I would like to remember that Stoltenberg is only authorized to conduct the consultations, so he can speak only when he is authorized to do so by all Member States. He has always scratched, he has always thrown gas on the fire, he has always been someone else’s ventriloquo.” “The only conversation that we have evidenced – continues the general – is of Lloyd Austin, U.S. Defense Secretary, who has manifested what is the final solution for him and thus reducing Putin to military impotence. The United States, in particular Joe Biden, has never spoken the word negotiated.”
3640	1	The disaster removed
3640	3	"A recent survey shows that among the concerns of the Swiss are health costs, pensions, and the fate of the AVS. The pandemic does not fear anymore. And of climate change we talk, but with a certain disconnection: there is not the same grip caused by the infection, yet someone will provide. Read, so much to quote one, Daniel Defoe: describes the behavior of the human race during the London Pest of 1665 and certain scenes are known and repeated. At that time, as today, isolation and distance and the prosemic space became a widespread cross. At that time, as today, there were many who, in praise to uncontrollable neurological dissests, indicated the causes of the disaster: the satanic conspiracy, the divine punishment went for the greater (the peste as ""just anger of God... to our correction sent over the mortals""). Things from other times? Not exactly! Today, even science in certain environments is execrable and the scientist is a presolated profit. And then there is QAnon, the trumpet stamp, which warns us: there are Jewish pedophile and convictional networks that sink in the shadow. The ignorance prevails, rather dissolves. It’s like headache: there’s no definitive cure and it always returns! Another proof that the illuminist faith in progress is sin of optimism: it does not always go forward, it often returns back."
3640	5	Why – I’m wondering – do we not have the same asylum on our terrestrial landscapes in the face of planetary devastations? Why does climate change, the disappearance of glaciers, deforestation, water bombs, the mountains that collapse, the increasing pollution not make us give up from misleading behavior to the environment? Why, I wonder, the global warming that has caused half a million deaths over the past 20 years, and the Global Climate Risk Index forecasts that even 250’000 deaths per year, don’t cause the same panic? Why, in the face of certain disasters, do we not go to search for the deep reasons but discuss the hydrological disaster, the anthropized territory, the lack of prevention? Why only a few fifth of people have a high perception of the risk we are running while others either are indifferent or look from the other side or are simply ignorant?
3640	7	One explanation of this is, in part, the theory of social risk building. He tells us some important things. It tells us that if a purely serious event, such as climate change, is spread over time, and develops by degrees on a very broad time scale, far from our eyes, to a long escape to our attention: the perception of the risk is low and can lead to ignoring the phenomenon, to feel it as a problem of others.
3640	9	Instead, the infection develops on a short time scale, invests in full and the perception of the risk is very high: the shrinking bars, the hospitals full, the empty streets give us the horrible sense of impotence.
3640	11	But there is, above all, a decisive difference between the two phenomena.
3640	13	Infection requires short-term, temporary and limited sacrifices in time and space: it is an interruption of our habits, a striking parenthesy in which the latter will be the same as the first (and in fact the intentions of redemption – less consumption, less travel, less pollution, we will be more virtuous and collaborative – passed the fear, are immediately evaporated and today, just because we have not learned anything, we are worse than before).
3640	15	Environmental degradation is a much more complicated thing because it is not a temporary and short-term event that will pass sooner or later: to fight it, we must forever revise our lifestyle, our behaviors, our economic model: we must abandon the idea that social well-being is associated with broken consumerism and the increase in GDP, we must realize that the latter will no longer be as the first.
3640	17	The fundamental question – informs the environmental sociologist – is that the victims of the destruction of the planet and the destructors are the same people: we are. We must defeat ourselves. It is tremendously difficult.
3640	19	And then, in order to fight the inertia and social unconsciousness of an announced disaster, should we recour to the hard and inflexible pudding of the state, the Leviathan prospected by Hobbes who all directs and all commands? Should we propugn the “ecological ethical” state that restricts with rigorous determination the freedom to dissipate to save the planet? Do we want the educational state to say what is good or what is bad, and the margins of tolerance are excluded? Obviously no: it is unnecessary to reiterate that the liberal state contemplates citizens and not subjects.
3640	21	"Per the only practicable way is the one indicated in 1994 by one of the historic leaders of the European Greens, Alexander Langer: suggested to stop the catastrophe that leads to inertia and passive withdrawal and to promote gradual changes, small intermediate tracks that stimulate the hope of success in the company, little by time: ""Ecological conversion can only be established if it appears socially desirable"" was the title of a conference. I agree. We must make the change socially desirable: it is not easy but it is the only way practicable."
3640	23	"And the politics? Per, by anger of floods and droughts that multiply everywhere, the policy has grown up a new consciousness and governments and parties are encouraged to insert the “climate change” into the agenda. I believe little: consciousness becomes propaganda when it is not followed by action and I don’t see the determined action, the proclamations perentors follow the fool of those who strive to conceive a world different from the one in which they live. To say the truth this alleged consciousness we find it more to the left than to the right, where there are still a lot of people who irrigate the “gretins” and those of “ambientalism out of place” (may you remember our politicians who advised the “scanaphatic young men” to go to work instead of losing time to protest? Do you remember them? They are still there, and the suspicion is that the Gattopard's rule is valid for them: ""If we want everything to remain as it is, we need everything to change."" So we talk about climate change, but then it continues as before and the Berne debate on climate initiatives confirms it. The policy continues to be strongly suspended, conditioned and contaminated by the neoliberal logic that has generated injustice and inequality. We know, but we continue to vote for them, the exponents of this doctrine. And nevertheless, when we give up to our representatives, we don’t forget that we are the voters who choose them and hard times we vote against our interests and we give ourselves a stick on our feet. Bertolt Brecht said, “The worst analphabet is the political analphabet.”"

3641	1	Ukraine: the coccodrillo tears of the West 
3641	3	Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continue and the number of victims rises to 16. This number indicates that the raids are targeted, otherwise the dead should be already hundreds. And this is the first consideration to be made, in the face of the chronicles, though fairly dramatic, of these days. Moscow, that is, is still retaining, and much, its potential.
3641	5	It’s not about relativizing anything, the dead are dead unfortunately, few or so many, but it’s about understanding what’s happening because, in the absence of a understanding of reality, it will continue to proceed as it has happened in these months, suspended in a bubble of deviant information, which obnubiles the minds and incats them in the macabro show placed on by the producers of the infinite wars, who are alignantly banqueting on the bodies of Ukrainians and Russians.
3641	7	Russia opens to Putin-Biden summit
3641	9	And it is important to understand, precisely, that Russian operations are targeted, although it is impossible to avoid accidental deaths – at the point we refer to so many “colateral” victims of American bombings – because, among other things, it indicates that there is still space for dialogue.
3641	11	Lavrov himself, who declared Putin’s willingness to meet with Biden at the next G20 in Indonesia. It will take place in mid-November.
3641	13	But it seems that there is no availability on the point. In the West we only talk about how to respond to the escalation of Russia, with America intending to send new air defense systems and the EU is ready to obey silently, no matter how longer this war is, the more the remaining spaces of freedom that are left to it will be eroded.
3641	15	Illuminating, in this sense, an imaginative article by James Pinkerton on the National Interest that prospects a future post-Ukrainian war somewhat remote, that sees a new global balance, where they face, in a new Cold War, two great powers.
3641	17	In fact, the war has generated two poles: on the one hand, the New Atlantic, in which the border between Europe and the United States is now indistinguished, with the destins of the first solidly in the hands of Washington, and the Middle Earth, with China which has now taken control of Russia, that the war has impoverished so much to become ancillary to Beijing. In this scenario there is no Putin, whose removal is the price that Moscow had to pay to humiliating peace with Kiev.
3641	19	It is a dystopian and apparently irrealistic scenario, but it must be taken seriously to understand what certain areas have in mind. Because it is true that New Atlantic is doing everything to launch a change regime in Moscow, which is the declared target of this prosecutor's war in which Ukraine is the sacrifice victim.
3641	21	Nothing new in this: all the infinite wars have never known hypotheses of compromise or limited targets, but removing Milosevic in former Yugoslavia, capturing or killing Bin Laden in the Afghan campaign, eliminating Saddam in Iraq, Gaddafi in Libya, Assad in Syria etc...
3641	23	A scheme that is always equal to itself. As schematic are also the motivations, always ideal, that have accompanied such wars. And the massive disinformation, part of which is aimed at removing from the chronicles the victims of their own actions, a scheme that is also reproduced in the Ukrainian conflict in which we talk about the victims of the Russian missiles, but nothing is said of the people killed by the friendly forces (in the Donbass area controlled by the Russians rains missiles on civilians every day and every day they make victims, today many more than those recorded in the recent Russian raid on Ukrainian cities... but just don’t talk about it, as if they didn’t exist).
3641	25	Immediate joy and strangled pain
3641	27	But the crazy aspect of this infernal machine is the rhetoric that is spreading in full hands. When the Kerch Bridge was hit the whole West went out as if the Ukrainians had made a goal. Kiev had profoundly hit against a very important target, highlighting all the deficits of the Russian forces, unable to defend the infrastructure.
3641	29	The attack was celebrated as the honor of the irreversible advanced Ukraine, an unquestionable sign of the irreversible collapse of the Russian army. They also enthusiastically raised the Ukrainian tweet that, according to the images of the hit bridge, added wishes to Putin for his seventy years.
3641	31	“Happy Birthday, Putin.” And they laughed... all as if it was a soap opera, no matter the fact that it was obvious that Russia would strongly respond to an attack on its territory (as would the Americans do if someone hit the Brooklyn Bridge). No matter if the attack had killed three people and the response would make many more...
3641	33	And now they cry the Ukrainians falling under the Russian bombs, accompanying such coccodrillo tears and their toning anger with heightening promises of new and more micidial weapons to send to Ukraine. No matter, even here, that this will only exponentially increase the number of people who will fall under the bombs, Russians and Ukrainians.
3641	35	No matter what they are condemning the middle class of the Old Continent, unless some change of the last hour, to restrictions that will not be equal in recent history (as much as the Telegraph has begun to give lessons of fasting to British citizens, just dinner at 17 and away...).
3641	37	This foolish political and journalist class, they make in contrast isolated voices, including those of Elon Musk, who has very high-level information, who, after proposing a peace plan, has now launched the warning that “the chances of a nuclear war are increasing.”
3641	39	The exit of the multi-billionaire is accompanied by the general Mike Mullen, already Head of the United States of the U.S. Army with Obama, who has affirmed the urgency of peace before the conflict goes out of control (Responsible Statacraft).
3641	41	The general knows better than so many charlatans who lead the steam how wars work and knows the risks thereof. It remains to see if such isolated voices, which speak in the name of many who do not have the courage or the opportunity to do so, will be able to make themselves heard. Before it is too late.
3641	43	The Ps. About the attack on the bridge, GrayZone publishes broad documentation of how the British suggested the Ukrainians to attack it, giving them a precise plan that highlighted the criticism and weaknesses of the structure. Documentation found useful for the operation carried out, even if in other ways. Whoever wants to go deeper, let’s go back to the original. If we write about it, it is only to highlight the role of London in this infinite war.
3642	1	Three thousand people killed or dispersed along the migration routes
3642	3	More than 3,000 people have lost their lives, or have been dispersed, along the world’s migration routes, in the first eight months of this year. This is a terrible number as dramatic, because it concerns women, men and minors who start in a journey already of its difficult, looking for a better life.
3642	5	The data tell that, despite the decrease in the number of migrants killed or disappeared in these years, new public policies are needed in relation to a phenomenon that continues to lead to suffering and death.
3642	7	They die everywhere, more in the Mediterranean
3642	9	On October 3, the island of Lampedusa commemorated the ninth anniversary of the shipwreck of a Libyan ship that in 2013 caused the deaths of 368 people, all of the nationalities of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It was the first time that the public began to celebrate the “National Day in Remembrance of the Victims of Immigration.”
3642	11	Although in the years of the “European migration crisis” (2015-2017) there has been a decrease in deaths and dispersions along the routes, there are still thousands of people who lose their lives every day during the journey.
3642	13	21.082 people were killed or dispersed along the world’s migration routes between 2015 and 2017.
3642	15	In the years of the crisis more than 20,000 people would have lost their lives, according to the estimates of the project “Missing migrants” of the International Organization for Migration (OIM), an UN agency. The most dramatic year was in 2016, when a total of 8.084 cases of people died or disappeared.
3642	17	It is good to emphasize that, according to the same admission of the OIM, it is estimated to decline, since many accidents are not intercepted and therefore recorded.
3642	19	As we mentioned, from January to August, 3.044 people died or lost traces, of which more than a thousand on the route that from North Africa arrives in Europe or in the Middle East through the Mediterranean Sea.
3642	21	According to the UN agency, this is the most dangerous migration route in the world.
3642	23	In the first eight months of the year more than a thousand dead and dispersed in the Mediterranean
3642	25	The estimates of deaths and disappearances between 1 January and 31 August 2022, in the main border areas crossed by migrants
3642	27	From January to August 2022, there have been 310 deaths and 851 disappearances: a total of 1,161 people. In the same geographical area, but in northern Africa, in the first eight months of the year 450 people have died or no more has been.
3642	29	But there have been hundreds of victims also in North and Central America, South Asia and the Caribbean Sea.
3642	31	In addition to extreme events such as death, migration routes are also very dangerous for violence that can be a victim along the borders. This is the case of the Balkans route, which we have talked about in a recent deepening.
3642	33	The Walls and Violence on the Balkan Route.
3642	35	In 2022 hundreds of deaths and disappearances in the sea
3642	37	"Back to the Mediterranean Sea, which represents the director along which the vast majority of migrants arrive in our country, through the data of ""Missing migrants"" you can also analyze the trends, month by month, in the number of dead and dispersed in the sea."
3642	39	More than 270 people died or dispersed in the Mediterranean
3642	41	Deaths and disappearances on the Mediterranean route, divided by months, from January to August 2022
3642	43	As said, from the beginning of the year and until last 31 August, more than a thousand cases of death or disappearance have been recorded in the three main Mediterranean routes. It is the western director, which travels to the Iberic Peninsula, the central (which mainly travels to Italy and Malta) and the east, which sees Greece as the main country of access to the continent.
3642	45	The most dramatic month was April, with 48 dead and 288 disappeared. An average of almost 10 people die or disappear every day.
3642	47	336 people died or disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea in April 2022, according to OIM data.
3642	49	From 2016 to 2021, the number of deaths and disappearances has decreased from 5,136 to 2,048. This decline, however, is not due to increased safety conditions in the sea crossing, but because - as we have documented in various occasions - the number of landings has dropped dramatically over the years.
3642	51	It is not possible to make a complete assessment of the data for 2022, as they only take into account the first eight months of the year.
3642	53	The need for new public policies
3642	55	The high risk rate of the routes that see protagonists migrants around the world puts the need to find structural solutions aimed at mining violence and death during the journey.
3642	57	As for sea access to southern European countries, it is obvious that the creation of a European border and coastal guard, which took place in 2016 to strengthen the European Foreign Border Control Agency (Frontex), established 12 years earlier, is not enough.
3642	59	Control of European borders and agreements with non-EU countries do not increase security, rather.
3642	61	In this sense, the protection of the rights of migrants has not been improved even with the agreements concluded in recent years, such as the agreement between the EU and Turkey and the Italian-Libyan memorandum.
3642	63	These are agreements aimed more than anything to keep migrants at the borders of the continent, with the effect (from European countries and institutions) to consciously ignore the violence committed to the harm of thousands of people arbitrarily detained in prison camps. Conditions of suffering that push even more to escape, with the effect of finding, sometimes, death in the sea.
3642	65	It should be collectively aware that the migration phenomenon is constant and in some ways unmarginable. It should also be organized and regulated to the best, for example through humanitarian corridors and international agreements between the countries of departure and departure, in order to reduce the likelihood of dying along the journey.
3643	1	Caritas Immigration Report, photo of foreign presence in Italy
3643	3	"The XXXI Immigration Report was presented in Rome by Caritas Italiana and Migrantes Foundation. The theme of this year is the theme chosen by Pope Francis for the 108th World Day of Migrants and Refugees which was celebrated last September 25: “Build the Future with Migrants.” To present the data two of the curators of the Immigration Report, Manuela De Marco di Caritas Italiana who illustrated the main data of the Report and Simone M. Varisco of the Migrantes Foundation who provided reflections on ""The Immigration between Communication and Pastoral""."
3643	5	Pandemic Increases Exclusion
3643	7	The analysis of the deaths in the first year of the pandemic shows a clear disadvantage to the population of foreign nationalism residing in Italy. During the pandemic health crisis hundreds of thousands of people, including many immigrants, were excluded from protection, mitigation and prevention programs (e.g., tampons and vaccines), recurrences, and probably even from future recurrence policies.” “Some areas of protection, especially those relating to pregnant women and newborns – it is still read in the report – then experience, regardless of the pandemic, a serious delay towards the population of Italian citizenship. The inequalities in the health profiles of immigrants must be considered “sentily” events in relation to the effectiveness of integration policies and indicate the urgency of an improvement in the capability to meet the health needs of the entire population.”
3643	9	"""From the encouraging signs"" of the post pandemic, ""we find the recovery of the growth of the foreign population residing in Italy: the data on 1 January 2022 speak of 5,193,669 foreign citizens regularly residing, a figure that marks a recovery from last year."" “In the framework of the first five residential regions – it is read in the report – the primate of Lombardy is confirmed, followed by Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, while the Toscana survives the Piemonte to the fifth place. The nationality framework remains substantially unchanged: among the residents prevail the Romanian citizens (about 1.080,000 citizens, 20.8% of the total), followed, in order, by Albanian citizens (8.4%), Moroccan citizens (8.3%), Chinese citizens (6.4%) and Ukrainian citizens (4.6%)”."
3643	11	“The number of foreign citizens holding a residence permit has also increased (on 1 January 2022 it is 3,921.125, while in 2021 it was certified at 3.3 million), as well as the new residence permits issued in the year: in the course of 2021 it was 275 thousand, +159% compared to 2020 (105.700); in particular, a taxation of the work reasons has been recorded, as the result of the sanatory procedure lasted by the government in 2020.” “Citizenship measures – it is still read – also marked a certain growth: they were 118 thousand in 2020, or a +4% from the previous year.”
3643	13	Foreigners the main group of users of Caritas
3643	15	"“The people of foreign origin who were transmitted in the course of 2021 in the Caritas Hearing Centers (CdA) were 120.536 people. On the total, foreigners affect by 55% and, compared to last year, they increase by three percentage points on the total output (in the course of 2020 they were 52%) and by +13,3% in terms of absolute values. It is therefore confirmed, their prevailing protagonism among the people who turn to the CDA.” “In the regions of North and Central Italy – continues the report – the face of the people taken in charge by Caritas coincides mostly with that of foreigners (in these macro-regions immigrants represent 64.1% and 56.8% respectively); in Midnight, instead, where higher levels of poverty and unemployment are recorded and, at the same time, a lower weight of the resident foreign component, the intercepted stories are mostly Italian and foreigners constitute a reduced share, equal to 28,5%.” ""Foreign users of Caritas - it is also explained - belong to 189 different nationalities, but, as for the previous year, the podium belongs to three nationalities: Morocco (21.177 people, equal to 18.1%), Romania (9.450, 7.8%) and Nigeria (8.844, 7.3%). It is confirmed a decline in foreigners from Eastern Europe, facing an increase in Africans: 48.8% of the presence (over a thousand units) comes from the African continent, with a strong incidence of the Hungarian and North African nations, which alone reach 25.6% of the presence."
3643	17	The number of migrants in the world is growing.
3643	19	The number of international migrants is estimated to be 281 million in 2021 (3.6% of the world’s population), compared to 272 million in 2019. Approximately two-thirds of them are migrants for work. The main cause of the increase in the total number of people living in a country other than their own is in the sharpening and extinction of the number of crises recorded worldwide, which have made the threshold of 100 million forced migrants (with a significant increase compared to 89.3 million by the end of 2021) to the beginning of 2022.
3643	21	“Significant – adds the report – also the existence of about 345 million people with severe food risk, 200 million more than before the pandemic. In the extended Mediterranean area there is an increase in the vulnerability situation of the resident foreign population, with severe consequences on the integration processes of migrants into the destination countries.”
3643	23	Students without Italian citizenship
3643	25	“A novelty for the school year 2020/2021 is the decrease in the number of students with non-Italian citizenship: 865.388 in total, with a decrease of more than 11 thousand units compared to the previous year (-1.3%). This is the first time since 1983/1984, school year from which reliable statistical findings have been made.” The percentage incidence of students with non-Italian citizenship on the total school population remains unchanged (10.3%) because the total number of students has decreased, i.e. the number of students with Italian citizenship has decreased.
3643	27	Lombardy is the region with the highest number of students with non-Italian citizenship (220.771), while Emilia-Romagna is the region with the highest percentage incidence (17.1% of the total regional school population). The provinces of Prato (28,0% of the total), Piacenza (23,8%), Parma (19,7%), Cremona (19,3%), Mantova (19,1%) and Asti (18,8%). “The data highlights the constant growth of the new generations, i.e. of students with non-Italian citizenship born in Italy: it is 66.7% of students from migratory contexts, a percentage point more than in 2019/2020. Although improving compared to the past, school delay is still a major obstacle to the integration of students with non-Italian citizenship into the Italian educational system, so much more that students with non-Italian citizenship continue to remain those with the highest risk of abandonment.”
3643	29	Currently, foreign presence decreases.
3643	31	"“With the analysis of the data of the prison reality it turns out that the incidence of the foreign component is decisively in contrast: faced with the general increase in the number of detainees (+1.4), in fact, the foreign presence, at a distance of one year, is substantially decreased (-1%). The data is in line with the trend of the last decade, during which the numbers of prisoners of foreign citizenship have significantly agreed.” More than half of foreign prisoners (53.3%) come from Africa and Morocco is the most represented foreign nation (19.6%). Following Romania (12.1%), Albania (10.8%), Tunisia (10.2%) and Nigeria (7.8%). In the female sections, of a total of 722 foreign detainees, mainly the detainees from Romania (24.1%), Nigeria (17.7%) and Morocco (5.8%). Thro the year, the number is increasingly increasing, but the presence of mothers detained with children is still marked, half of whom are foreign citizens.” ""Statistics on the types of crime - the report continues - confirms the general data that sees the crimes against the property as the list with the highest number of detainees (8.510 foreigners accused or convicted for this case of crime, or 27% of detainees for the crime in question and 49.9% of foreign detainees). The following are the crimes against the person (7.285) and those in the field of drugs (5.958)""."
3643	33	“The data – it is therefore emphasized – again returns the photo of a system in which migrants get more easily into the prison system and get less easily out of it than the Italians. If the inflated penalties indicate a less social danger for immigrants, they benefit more gently from alternative measures than the indigenous prisoners. Foreigners are also more strictly subjected to caution in prison: 32% of prisoners are waiting for the first trial. This circumstance, which ends with determining a overrepresentation of the foreign prison population.”
3643	35	When foreigners are the victims of the crimes
3643	37	The conditions of marginality in which the migrant population is frequently displaced lead to increased exposure to the risk of being a victim of a crime. The catalogue of crimes of which foreigners are passive subjects is, unfortunately, quite wide and spaces from the most scary crimes, starting from human trafficking, to the multiple and “ordinary” forms of victimization that are often overwhelmed. At the top of the list of the most hateful crimes there are those who see as victims the minors. In this sense, foreigners represented 4% of the victims of sexual assault and taken into charge for the first time in 2021 by the Office of Social Services for Minors. Foreigners victims of other forms of exploitation and abuse were 9% of the total of minors and taken into charge during the same period.”
3644	1	Abortion: One in two doctors is targeted
3644	3	In the island, pregnancy interruptions are decreasing.
3644	5	Nearly 50% of the anesthesists who should assist when the surgery for pregnancy interruption is performed in Sardinia are objectors of consciousness. The national average is 44.6%.
3644	7	In Italy the average is 64.4%, in the island it reaches 55.6%, that is, more than one in two. The framework arises from the latest ministerial report on women who in Italy have voluntarily interrupted a pregnancy that, however, are in decline. Pregnancy disruptions that result in decrease also on the island.
3644	9	One fact this seems essentially due to the use of the pill 5 days later, which from October 2020 no longer requires prescription. Different is for the RU486, i.e. the pharmacological method for voluntary interruption of pregnancy, which can be used only in receipt regime but also - as prescribed by the Ministerial Circular 2020 - in other structures through a controlled path. In relation to this indication, Sardinia adapted to its time but did not define the indication that can also be administered at home, although not excluding it.
3644	11	But if you are going to see the latest available data on 1393 pregnancy interruptions on the island and on 14 operational obstetrics and gynecology facilities, 1144 (the 82.1%) were made in public care institutions, while 249 in convened clinics (the 17.9%). None in other facilities or at home, always standing at the ministerial data.
3645	1	Covid, study: there is no evidence that comes from a laboratory
3645	3	"""There is no evidence"" that triggering the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has been a virus unintentionally exploded by a Chinese research center in Wuhan. On the contrary, among the hypotheses on the origin of the epidemic, the most likely and scientifically valid seems to be the zoonosis, the contact with wildlife, and, in particular, the Wuhan's ittic market. It is the result of a new study conducted by scientists of the Independent Task Force on Covid-19 and other Pandemics, a team of internationally renowned researchers experts in human, animal and public health, virology, epidemiology, wildlife biology and ecology."
3645	5	The study.
3645	7	The results were published on the pages of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
3645	9	During the study, also conducted by Italian researchers, the researchers have collected information on the main focal viruses in Rna since 1967, rebuilding patterns of spread, etiology and viral infections.
3645	11	Global pandemic risks
3645	13	The Task Force has also developed a strategy to effectively prevent and counter the risk of global zoonic pandemic, based on three key steps: surveillance, research and information.
3645	15	Specifically, in reference to the first point, the researchers emphasized the need to estimate the risk of spillover through intelligent interfaces that monitor wildlife, livestock and human beings. As for research, however, according to the researchers it is essential to be able to rely on adequate funds for timely development of specific medications and vaccines. The last step concerns the need to prevent disinformation and spread messages supported by scientific evidence. “The world has largely failed in the prevention and initial response to the pandemic,” said Gerald T. Keusch, president of the Task Force and researcher at the University of Boston. “Our work highlights that a One Health approach, capable of balancing and optimizing the relationship between the health of people, animals and ecosystems, is crucial to address
3646	1	UN Climate Change, OMM Energy Report.
3646	3	The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations member has published the “State of Climate Services 2022” report to photograph the current status quo of climate change. The analysis is based on the theory that energy and resources to produce it are the essential raw material in this historic moment.
3646	5	The WHO’s 2030 goal is to increase renewable sources by at least 50 percent to counter global overheating.
3646	7	UN Climate Change Can Boost Geopolitical Hierarchy of Energy
3646	9	The United Nations Climate and Weather Board, the WHO, explains what should be the virtuous circle for a planet more attentive to climate change. On the one hand, the energy supply, an indispensable element in the current geopolitical economy, on the other hand, the weather conditions.
3646	11	Today, the real problem is the difficulty in interpreting weather information, which makes it difficult to make more accurate forecasts. This makes it impossible to make forecasts on energy storage and thus understand how to meet the growing energy demand. The risk is to see extreme weather events to which they arrive unprepared and without any guarantees for the energy future.
3646	13	As you know, 2050 is the symbolic deadline to climate neutrality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To complete the famous “ecological transition”, massive investments in infrastructures such as solar, wind and hydroelectric reinforcement are needed: modernization is efficient in this case.
3646	15	Water, good in exhaust
3646	17	The report then shows a focus on water resources, known as “scares”. As a result, the hydroelectric system is intended to disappear if the drought-related trend should persist over the long term. The problem, however, is that 87% of global electricity is derived from water availability.
3646	19	Here are other data that photograph the current difficulties:
3646	21	33% of the thermal power plants that depend on the availability of fresh water for cooling are located in areas with high water stress. The percentage will fall to 15% in the case of existing nuclear power plants, but we expect a 25% increase in the next 20 years.
3646	23	11% of the hydroelectric capacity is located in areas with high water stress, approximately 26% of existing hydroelectric wells and 23% of the planned wells are located within river waters that presently present an average-high risk of water deficiency.
3646	25	In addition, nuclear power plants, which depend on water for cooling systems, are potentially vulnerable to sea level rising and flooding due to climate change.
3647	1	More than 5 million migrants in Italy, however, remain inequalities
3647	3	There are 5,193,669 foreign citizens regularly residing in Italy since 1 January 2022, a figure that indicates a recovery of migration in our country compared to last year but the inequalities are not mitigated. In the framework of the first five residential regions, the primate of Lombardy is confirmed, followed by Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, while the Toscana survives the Piemonte to the fifth place. Among the residents are the Romanians (approximately 1.080,000 citizens, 20.8% of the total), followed in order by Albanians (8.4%), Moroccan (8.3%), Chinese (6.4%) and Ukrainians (4.6%). This is the result of the 2022 Immigration Report by Caritas Italiana and Migrantes Foundation.
3647	5	The number of foreign citizens holding a residence permit has also increased (at 1 January 2022 it was 3,921,125, while in 2021 it was certified at 3,3 million), as well as the new residence permits issued in the year: in the course of 2021 it was 275 thousand, +159% compared to 2020 (105,700); in particular, a work reason tax has been recorded. There has also been a worrying increase in the number of unaccompanied foreign minors, arrived in April 2022 to 14.025, also due to the war in Ukraine, from which it comes about 28% of the total. In the first quarter of 2022, the Istat data on the Workforce Relevation recorded, after a strong decline in the previous year, an increase in the employment rate of foreign workers between the ages of 20 and 64, more significant than that recorded among Italian workers (+1.5 against +0.8).
3647	7	There are several criticisms: the most significant increases in the types of employment are learning and collaborations; compared to Italians, the growth of unlimited time contracts has been much more modest (approximately 11% against more than 40%), demonstrating the fact that foreign workers are experiencing increased precarious work: 7 out of 10 contracts are terminated; in addition, an increase in employment has led to an increase in termination of employment relations (+9.9% among EU workers and 28,0% among non-EU workers). In a critical context, there are still positive paradoxes. In Italy there are 136,312 women-managed companies abroad, which equal to 11.6% of women-managed activities and 23.8% of immigrants-founded. In the last ten years, they have increased by 42.7% and have grown at a higher rate than men-driving.
3647	9	The people of foreign origin who were transmitted in the course of 2021 to the Caritas Hearing Centers (CdA) were 120.536 people. On the total, foreigners affect by 55% and, compared to last year, they increase by three percentage points on the total output (in the course of 2020 they were 52%) and by +13,3% in terms of absolute values. It is therefore confirmed, their prevailing protagonism among the people who address to the CDA. A novelty for the school year 2020/2021 is the decrease in the number of students with non-Italian citizenship: 865.388 in total, with a decrease of more than 11 thousand units compared to the previous year (-1.3%). This is the first time that happens from 1983/1984, school year from which reliable statistical findings have been made.
3648	1	It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do.
3648	3	It is a migrant chaos in Italy, where the pressure for irregular arrivals is increasing, both by sea and by land. The Ocse numbers confirm the perception of an increase in flows but it’s enough to look at what’s happening in our country to realize that there’s a significant increase in arrivals, which puts the system of reception and the work of the order forces to be hard tested. And so, while the left continues to deny the problem, Italy still makes accounts with a huge overload of work, hotspots full and revolts that threaten the security of the country.
3648	5	Chaos of Lampedusa
3648	7	As long as the Viminale runs to release the hotspot, Imbriacola continues to reign the chaos. 80 migrants this morning were made to rise on a direct line ferry to Porto Empedocle but in the first reception center of Lampedusa there are still 585 migrants in front of 350 seats available. Also because, despite the overload of people and the obvious difficulty in management. Lampedusa became the safe port for 48 migrants on board the Spanish NG ship Louise Michel. Despite all during the day, the island was subjected to a strong stress due to the numerous landings that followed throughout the day.
3648	9	Immigrants from land
3648	11	The Balkans route is still quite active, as the 110 people who were traced a few hours ago in Trieste show. They came from the former border with Slovenia, especially in the Ormai common area of San Dorligo della Valle. They were largely identified by border police officers and Italian soldiers engaged in border surveillance. A dozen migrants presented themselves directly to the committees. It is for most Afghan citizens, but there are also Indian citizens or partis from the Middle East. Almost everyone has been asking for political asylum.
3648	13	In the night between Saturday and Sunday, three foreigners between the ages of 18 and 20 were identified in the area of the Green Count, to the border with France, in an area above 2,000 meters. The three said they came from Iraq, Mali and Mauritania. They were traced with a principle of hypothermia, they said they were lost. Alpine rescue technicians provided dry clothes and thermal tells. They then accompanied them walking to the fuoristrada and then to Claviere, where they were delivered to the carabinieri and the ambulance.
3648	15	The Ocse Report on Migrants
3648	17	Between January and December 2021, Frontex recorded a total of 196.034 illegal crossings at the EU’s external borders. This figure corresponds to an increase of 56.7% compared to the 125.110 cases registered in 2020, but also an increase of 38.3% compared to 2019, the last year before the imposition of mobility restrictions related to Covid. According to the findings, in 2021 the flows continued to move from the Eastern Mediterranean route to the Central Mediterranean route and the Western Balkans. In 2021, the Central Mediterranean route recorded an increase in detections of 83.6% - for a total of 65.362 detections.
3649	1	A total of 11 billion people were killed by the pandemic. And the regions are at risk of closing in red
3649	3	The Covid-19 pandemic has invested the National Health System (Ssn) with heavy effects not only in terms of greater hospitalizations and nosocomi holding but also on the financial front, heavily eroding the economic resources intended to give new oxygen to the Health Fund. From 2020 to today, public health funding has gone from 113.8 billion to 124.9 billion, an increase of 11.2 billion, of which 5.3 are allocated by Covid decrees. However, these resources have been fully absorbed by the pandemic and in 2022 several regions are at risk of closing with red accounts. This is the analysis contained in the fifth report of the Gimbe Foundation on Ssn.
3649	5	The rise of public funding for health, Gimbe emphasizes, has been “imposed by the pandemic” but also “erious” by this. And it still lacks a “structually” reinforcement of the Ssn, while many criticisms remain unresolved: very long waiting lists for visits, exams, surgical operations and screening; but also new health needs, especially those detected by the effects of the long-covid and the recurrences of the pandemic on mental health. And, above all, the further weakening of the healthcare staff: “Pre-pension, burnout and demotivation, voluntary dismissals and escape to the private leave more and more key sectors, especially the Emergency,” Gimbe notes.
3649	7	The call to the future government “mets health at the center”
3649	9	This is a call to the future government: Italy, warns President Gimbe Nino Cartabellotta, “spends little on public health, so much that we are on the 16th place in Europe; the new executive puts health at the center.” At the same time, the epidemiological picture in Italy signs a slowdown in the growth of cases, but it will still need to wait at least a week, according to experts, to be able to understand what the curves will be. We must prepare ourselves for “salite and rediscese,” warns Alessandro Vespignani, new president of the Isi Foundation, an international center that works on complex systems and data based in Turin. According to the analysis of the mathematician Giovanni Sebastiani, of the Institute for Applications of Calculation ‘M.Picone’ of the National Research Council (Cnr), the cases of Covid-19 are decreasing in eight Italian provinces, seven of which are in the South and one in the Center, but it will take a week to confirm if it is a real drop in the curve and not a stage.
3649	11	The confirmation that the curve of the infections rises in the last days more slowly comes from Cartabellotta, “but we still need to understand the effects of the abolition of the duty of mascara on the public media. We had a circle in that sense – he says – but unfortunately it won’t see the light, as we are in a transition phase between one executive and the other.”
3649	13	Another data, observes epidemiologist Cesare Cislaghi, is that the SarsCoV2 viruses “may be much more positive than those officially, and this would explain why, despite the slowing increase of the new cases, the recovery is growing.” According to Cislaghi, “the number of ‘conscious’ infected because of the ether or self-diagnosed would today be about half higher than that by the data of the Civil Protection and therefore an incidence not of forty thousand a day but of seventy thousand and a prevalence of positive not of fifty thousand but of seven hundred and fifty thousand.”
3649	15	And he is worried about the situation in prisons where the infections rise again. According to the latest data of the Ministry of Justice, the positive prisoners are 239 out of a prison population of 55,249 people. No one of them was hospitalized. As for the numbers of the epidemic in the last 24 hours, after the physiological decrease of the weekend a rise is recorded: there are 65,925 newly infected (15.089), according to the data of the Ministry of Health. The victims are 80 (51 years), and the rate of positivity is 19.8% (compared with 18.1% of the previous day). In hospitals, there are 224 hospitalized in intensive therapy (216 years), or 8 more, while hospitalized in ordinary departments are 6,259, or 272 more.
365	1	The new walls
365	3	For those who were not aware of this, the Russian army's breakdown on the Ukrainian battlefield has triggered an escalation in the logic with which the Kremlin approaches the conflict. Now in those rooms that appear on the Red Square we talk about war in the West and no longer about “special operation”, the strange expression with which the Pudinian lessic had baptized the invasion. They use the term “war” by applying it to values, lifestyle, and even religion, because there is a need for a great danger to motivate in front of a disoriented public opinion a general mobilization.
365	5	But the most worrying thing is the combination of the referendum on occupied territories in Ukraine (Donbass, Lugansk and Crimea) and the new Moscow military doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons: according to Putin, they are now usable not only against existential threats and the territorial integrity of the Russian state, but also on endless topics such as the defense of independence and freedom. A mechanism of this kind emphasizes that if the populations of the occupied areas of Ukraine decide to be annexed to the Russian territory, the Zar is ready to use nuclear weapons to defend them, so as not to give them back to Kiev. Theories revised and corrected in an even more cynical logic than those studied by Putin in the KGB schools.
365	7	Now it is also possible that Moscow is the bluff of despair, but it is obvious that these theories end up also to change the behavior of states and people. In fact, the neighboring countries, if they do not want that tomorrow the Kremlin revend other pieces of the former Soviet empire, must absolutely avoid that Russian troops enter (just think of the Baltic Republics): they must, therefore, preside, strengthen the borders, create a new iron curtain with Russia. The first consequence of this absurd war, therefore, is that we have returned to the logic of the walls and to a new race to rearm. The consequences are not only military.
365	9	Oh yeah, because the escalation is shaking the awareness of those subjects of the Tsar who have so far been indifferent to the conflict, because it had not changed their lives much more: the general mobilization has in fact placed on ambassades in Russia all those who are at risk of being relocated to fight a war for which they tend to understand the reasons. A bit like us, the increase in gas has cooled solidarity with Ukraine of the most affected categories. Just that one account is to pay a more salty bill, another is to risk life. A condition of unacceptable danger for those young people or those Russian environments who have been “contaminated” to use a precious expression to the Kremlin, from the West. From here the general escape from the country is by the media and observers. Per talking about escape will be an exaggeration, but that there are the first signs of the phenomenon and that the insufficiency is mounting are uncontroversial data: everyone wants to expat before the wall is erected as in Berlin in 1961. This is why they begin to swallow forms of public disagreement that until a month ago in Russia were unthinkable. If this situation is also added to the tightness on passports decided by many Western countries, the return to the walls of a time is undeniable. Walls are easy to build, but hard to destroy as Berlin has taught.
3650	1	Climate crisis: debt burns the island states
3650	3	Small island states spend 18 times more on their debt than to defend themselves from the climate crisis
3650	5	Small developing island states spend 18 times more on debt repayment than on climate crisis measures. They are among the most vulnerable to climate change countries, but do not have the means to recover after any climate disaster. It affects 65 million people, almost 1% of the world’s population. And that is getting worse under the weight of other concomitant crises, from the Covid-19 to the inflation spiral to the global impacts of the war in Ukraine.
3650	7	The Small Island Developing States is a report by Eurodad, the European network of over 50 NGOs working on debt, development financing and poverty reduction.
3650	9	In 2025, 20 of the 37 SIDS will have a lower government expenditure capacity than in 2019, before the arrival of the Covid-19, and will still decline for 31 of them. If this limits the ability to respond to the climate crisis, the tomb stone on the possibilities of SIDS comes from the weight of debt.
3650	11	For 81% of these countries, the debt level is considered critical according to the IMF and NGOs as Debt Justice UK or Jubilee Germany. Twelve of these countries are in a situation of debt crisis concluded or at the gate according to all the assessments: they are Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Maldives, Papua New Guinea, Saint Vincent and Grenadines, Samoa, São Tomé and Príncipe, Suriname and Tonga.
3650	13	In the five years 2016-2020, SIDS received just $1.5 billion in climate finance. But in the same period, 22 of the 37 countries had to spend more than 26 billion to their external creditors on debt interests. And the average public debt went from 66% of GDP in 2019 to 83% the following year. With the prospect of raising up to 70% by 2025. Data that further limit the space of these countries in responding to the climate crisis.
3651	1	The Covid accelerates in Ticino
3651	3	The weekly cases go from a little less than 2,000 to 3,044, doubling the patients: in 6 in intensive therapy but no deaths
3651	5	"In Ticino, a ""important acceleration"" of coronavirus infections is recorded, according to the newspaper released on Wednesday morning. In the last seven days, 3,044 people were positive, 55% in more than a week ago. Hospitalizations double for the third week in a row, the patients affected by the disease are now 161, of which you are in intensive therapy (there were three at the previous update). There are no deaths recorded."
3651	7	On Wednesday, the Cantonal Medical Office had announced 1,960 new infections – a figure that was already 78% higher than the previous – and two deaths in a week.
3651	9	Now again emphasizes the importance of vaccination, so much more that in these days the calling campaign is triggered. This is to prevent the most severe cases and especially for the most vulnerable people: 75% of the recovered are 65 years old or older.
3652	1	Long Covid: WHO calls for rapid action
3652	3	The WHO calls on governments around the world to take rapid action to tackle the long Covid crisis. According to the WHO, the long Covid is devastating the lives and means of survival of tens of millions of people.
3652	5	WHO calls for rapid action to tackle long covid
3652	7	While many countries have gone out of the emergency phase of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a call to all governments to implement a quick action to address the serious long Covid crisis. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the long Covid is “destroying” the lives and means of survival of tens of millions of people and is also devastating health systems and economies.
3652	9	“The world has never been in a better position to end the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is also very clear that many of the viral infected are still experiencing prolonged suffering,” he told The Guardian Ghebreyesus. “With the absence of evidence on how to treat it best, Covid has long been disturbing people’s lives and many face often long and frustrating expectations for support or guidance. A large number of people who have been crudly affected by the long Covid coat is also having a dangerous impact on the health systems and the economies still shocked by the waves of infections. The impact of the long Covid for all countries is very serious and requires an immediate and sustained action equivalent to its scope,” he added.
3652	11	The WHO director then said there is growing evidence that the long Covid is preventing a huge number of people from “life their own full life.” “The world has already lost a significant number of workforce due to illness, deaths, fatigue, unplanned retirement due to an increase in long-term disability, which not only has an impact on the health system, but is a blow to the general economy,” he said.
3652	13	The WHO proposals
3652	15	Tedros said there are “five key elements” needed to continue efforts in the fight against the long Covid. Countries must listen to patients, use their “first-hand knowledge” to model long Covid policies and collect better data to better understand the condition. Information sharing between countries needs to be improved to “rap the gap of knowledge” around the world. He also called for a “fair access” to Covid tests, treatments and vaccines to first prevent infections and then reduce the risk of long Covid, “supported investments” in long scientific research on Covid and a ready “multidisciplinary assistance” for long Covid patients.
3652	17	The long covid hit millions of people.
3652	19	The WHO estimates that about 10% to 20% of Covid infection survivors have developed symptoms in the medium and long term. Among these are fatigue, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. A study published this month suggests that 17 million people in Europe alone could have experienced long Covid symptoms during the first two years of the pandemic. The modeling also suggests that women have twice the chances of men to develop long Covid and the risk increases significantly among the serious infections they need to recover. According to the research, one in three women and one in five men are likely to develop long Covid.
3653	1	What made the hurricane Ian so powerful?
3653	3	In the photos taken by the International Space Station on September 28, the hurricane Ian is a monster that covers the entire peninsula of Florida. What allowed that which was initially a tropical storm, to gain such a destructive power? The answer must be sought in the sea.
3653	5	According to new NASA findings by the New York Times, the exceptionally hot waters in the Gulf of Mexico have powered the weather system by turning it into one of the most violent storms falling on the U.S. over the past 10 years.
3653	7	"Energy from the sea. Normally, tropical cyclones (called hurricanes in the United States and the Caribbean) lose power after heating winds and rain on the ground, because they get away from the moisture and thermal energy that comes from the seas, their main ""motor"". Ian also did so, after sowing devastation in the southwest of Florida, ruining houses and boats, flooding full coastal settlements and leaving without current at least 2.2 million people."
3653	9	While moving to the inside of Florida, Ian lost energy and was declassed to a tropical storm - for the measurement of the intensity of these phenomena there is an applied scale, see - but when he crossed the Atlantic again to go to South Carolina he gained it again.
3653	11	"The ideal scenario. Ian then had the way to ""charge"" several times on the sea along his path. September already represents the peak of the hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, because at this time of the year the surface sea waters are hot, and in the last three years the climate phenomenon de La Niña has created favourable conditions for the formation of hurricanes in the North Atlantic. Moreover, this year, the ocean temperatures in the anti-stantial waters of Florida were higher than 2-3 degrees Farenheit (a few centimeters of degrees Celsius) than the seasonal average. It is not little: to make the ocean temperatures even minimally rise it is necessary that the seas absorb enormous amounts of heat."
3653	13	More intense, faster and rain. The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat produced by human activity. For this reason, although climate change has not necessarily increased the number of hurricanes, it has made them more intense, because they provide them with all the excess energy they need. The number of destructive storms (sources of categories 4 and 5) has increased from the 1980s to today.
3653	15	The climate crisis also favours another phenomenon, that of the rapid intensification of tropical storms, i.e. the capacity of the winds that support them, to increase speeds at least 55 km/h within 24 hours. It happened with Ian but it happened also, 5 years ago, with Hurricane Harvey, passing from category 1 to 4 in a night.
3653	17	It is not all. Climate change makes the hurricanes even more flourished. For each degree of additional heating, the atmosphere treats about 7% more water steam that is released in the form of precipitation. This, in a landscape already threatened by the rise of sea levels and the phenomenon of subsistence (i.e. the progressive deforestation) of the coasts.
3654	1	Climate: September 2022 the fourth most hot ever detected in the world
3654	3	Monthly Copernicus Bulletin: Extraordinary Temperatures in Greenland
3654	5	Milan is 6th. (askanews) – September 2022 “was overall the fourth most hot ever noticed” worldwide, with the global average temperature resulting “more than 0.3°C than the average recorded in the period between 1991 and 2020.” This is the result of the last monthly report developed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Middle-Term Meteorological Forecasts on behalf of the European Commission.
3654	7	In Europe, according to Copernicus, the average temperature in September was about 0.4°C lower than the average temperature recorded in the period between 1991 and 2020. The situation is different in Greenland, where exceptional temperatures have been recorded, which in some locations have exceeded more than 8 degrees per month average, resulting in the hotest temperatures ever observed for the month of September.
3654	9	As for the extension of Antarctic sea ice, in September it was about 3% below the average, although there were two notable areas in the Siberian sector, where sea ice was above the average.

3655	1	Ukraine: nothing ne va plus — The Indro
3655	3	I don’t know to what extent there is still perception of reality in the ‘managers’ of our disgraceful world. The impressive impression is that now everyone only looks at himself, his own feet.
3655	5	Literally, to the point of sparks... on the feet.
3655	7	Not a joke, it happened yesterday to the extra, stra-stra, U.S.-Korean supermissiles sent to pollute the environment in response to another missile, less extra, but... which worked according to the forecasts, of North Korea, that of ‘Pazzo Kim’ at all. One of those extra stra-stra, he fell between his feet, in Korea. Luckily (luckily... luckily often helps the fools) the missile shot to show that they also have it, fell a little later, luckily (this is to say) on a military base. Have you noticed the animated cartoons of Bugs Bunny or the Cat Silvestro?! You don’t know (they will never say) if and how many victims he has done, but it doesn’t matter à la guerre comme à la guerre! And then, if the missile helmet on the feet of Vladimir Putin is talking about it throughout the press, you make cartoons and movies, but if it falls to uncle Sam, everything goes well!
3655	9	I would like to emphasize again. Kim Jong-un, throwing a missile, either to test it (it’s the biggest ever for North Korea), or to show that he has them too. It can be seen, rather, it is clearly, also a threat. But why when the evidence is made by the United States, Britain, Italy, etc... it is evidence, when Kim Jong-un is threat?
3655	11	I am a lawyer without fantasy. For me, things are what I am. Kim launches his missile, and good night, it doesn’t hurt anyone, he’s just polluted some air and sea, I don’t know if he’s warned Japan (I think yes, but I don’t know), but it’s still ‘only’ passed over him. If he doesn’t have anything better to do, the Japanese Emperor writes a letter of bad words to Kim, right? The United States and France literally disintegrated various islands to test their atomic bombs and the only to protest were a group of ‘greens’.
3655	13	In our heavens everything passes and we don't say anything, rather, we smile pleased... by the way, that American soldier who killed people in monopathy because drunk, what end he did, is already taking the sun in California?
3655	15	The meaning of the whole should be that Kim wanted to show that it can also hit Japan, and that the US etc... show that they can, what we already know perfectly.
3655	17	They show the muscles, illuminating, I think, that someone does like the monkeys and, scared, show the c...!
3655	19	On the other hand, the increasingly plateally U.S. war (with the Europeans stupidly) against Russia, is disbalancing. I don’t think it will be so long, the Russians will react and will be painful and dead yet, while now the Ukrainians are fighting with U.S. and British (and unfortunately European) weapons led by U.S. officials, organized by U.S. spy, directed by U.S. satellite control stations, etc. And this is another highlight of the topic.
3655	21	The ongoing war in Ukraine is a completely uncompensed war, because against Russia it has swallowed half the world, making fiction of being neutral, which is not. This is not me, but international law.
3655	23	And even here, it seems that you play to those who send it further, as you did as boys. Just that in anger of resurrection, as many wise people had warned, you arrive at a point where there is no more possible resurrection. And then, in the West, it was simply so: at the request to ‘see’, what had reloaded and had no point pulled out the gun, or pulled out the other. One of them was “lost”.
3655	25	The other day’s statement of that inexistent person who is Jens Stoltenberg, who speaks on the indication of the USA, and only of the USA, we in the NATO contain even less than Stoltenberg, his statements that “poses red lines,” as the newspapers say, are like the last rise in this poker game among people very little for good.
3655	27	Russia has made it mean, or let it mean, that in the event of extreme danger from its point of view it is ready to use nuclear weapons, especially after having just suffered an attack, of obvious “western” origin, let’s not take around, to the behaviors that bring gas... to Europe: that is, those thanks to which it can more deal! If it were Europe, it would act like that well-known husband.
3655	29	In response, Stoltenberg releases dark threats, but obviously referred to nuclear weapons, and to burn the bridges behind (and to predispose the possibility of a violent reaction) “warns” that damages to the “European” submarines would not remain without response.
3655	31	If I was permitted an irrevocating comparison: it’s like a bank hijacker threatened the director, to make him open the wallet, to kill his wife. It is irreversible because it has not yet been determined who has placed those mines, or better, in the interest of those who have been placed.
3655	33	But we survive on the guilt and responsibilities, so much we know that something will be known not before 50 years, not even our children. Let’s survive, but let’s honestly say that we’re now at the limit. Whoever bluff, whoever bluff, has no more terms of bluff.
3655	35	It is time to deal. On the only certain basis on which a negotiation is possible, without losing the face of anyone, even if it will not resurrect the dead.
3655	37	Volodymyr Zelenski doesn’t want the negotiation because he really hopes that he can throw the Russians beyond the border, and therefore takes the same the US, to encourage them to give other weapons, so that the cause of the possible defeat of the Ukrainians does not appear. Zelensky, tell us one of us, has become an element of continuous pressure and rejection. Is it possible that the whole Europe, Britain, the United States can let themselves be caught by Zelensky? It seems absurd to me. But it is also clear that a stop to Zelenski can only be given by opening a negotiation on the legal merit of the problems. On which, you will note me, I have written several times and therefore I don’t come here, although, being less known and less good of Professor Alessandro Orsini, I am less afraid of being attacked as phil-Putin. And then I refer to the considerations already made before.
3655	39	It is, however, certain that we are now at the highest point of a tension, that, that’s why I talked about Kim, there is the concrete risk that no one can stop the conflict, at least the Ukrainian, except the unimpossible hypothesis of the lack of control over something that leads to hell. Certainly, hell would affect Ukraine, part of Russia and Europe; for the United States there would be no significant consequences. And this also comes into the game, these are also matters to pay attention to, to understand to what extent the cards on the table are those on the table and not one in some manic!
3656	1	Boom of the beer party at the Austrian elections: it is the third political force
3656	3	Austria is the third-largest political force in the country with 8.4% of the consensus.
3656	5	Last week, we talked about this original candidate political movement to the Austrian elections that took place on Sunday: a movement founded in 2015 that at the beginning only dealt with satirism but that, after a short time, decided to go into politics.
3656	7	According to the pre-election surveys, it would have to gather 5% of the consensus, but the outcome arising from the scratch of the cards went well beyond the most rose expectations of the same militants: the beer party has in fact obtained 8.4% of the votes that will allow it to be the third force of the new Parliament.
3656	9	By analyzing the vote, even more surprising the trail achieved in the capital Vienna, where at the 2020 municipal elections the movement had already managed to make elect eleven own representatives within the citizen council: here he actually surpassed 10% placing himself in the second place of preferences behind the only representative of the Greens Alexander Van Der Bellen who, as widely planned, stumbled the elections with 56.2% of the votes (Fpoe's ultra-right, second, stopped at 17.9%).
3656	11	This surprising result was made possible by the great consensus obtained among the younger voters, especially the under 30: the merit of the impending social campaign carried out by the party through a series of videos not only institutional but also ironic: a return to the origins of the movement that obviously focused the goal.
3656	13	The party’s leader is Marco Pogo, the art name of Dominik Wlazny, of cabinetist profession, and the “Byrocratic Movement” (this is the official definition), which announces more than a thousand tesserates, aims to establish in the country a “byrocracy”: it would be a form of government aimed at further increasing the value of the multi-secular national brassic culture, making it a true institution.
3656	15	Among the most important points of the government programme are the creation of a beer fountain in the historic centre of Vienna, the abolition of the beverage tax for bars and restaurants, and the monthly supply of a barrel of white to all Austrian families at state expenses.
3656	17	Among the proposals of the party we find also that of a special support thought for “the people with less talent in drinking”, i.e. a real training program, at the expense of the state, dedicated, in a particular way but not only, to all those who move the first steps in the unfinished worldwide brassic panorama so that they always make the best choices.
3656	19	In fact, the program tolerates the consumption of any beer, but there is an absolute ban for the Radler (a mixture between beer and lemonate with a maximum alcohol rate of 3%), which is indicated as “the most absolute evil” (n.d.r.It’s a good idea, but it’s a good idea, it’s a good idea, it’s a good idea, it’s a good idea, it’s a good idea.
3656	21	In addition to the proposals related to beer, there are other points in the political project also related to a form of protest against the ruling class for which obligatory attitude tests should be carried out. It is then planned the implementation of state aid for the preservation of the cultural scene, kneeling from the pandemic and slow recovery, and a series of initiatives aimed at bringing the voters back to the urns to “restore to the Austrian politics the seriousness it deserves”.
3656	23	Not having won the elections, of course, these projects will not be realized, but without a doubt the beer party has recorded a truly incredible data that demonstrates how everywhere, more and more, political forces are affirming completely strange to schemes and canons of traditional parties: in this case it is a party born from a satiric movement, reason for which it is not difficult to find some analogy with what was done at the time by Beppe Grillo, notoriously a former comic, in Italy.
3657	1	Previous PostPrevious Previous post: Maybe we’re going to get a lot of trouble
3657	3	What reason should we attribute to the boots of this final campaign, unless we associate them with carnaval rites but infinitely less joyful?
3657	5	The world’s crazyest election campaign turns to the end, among bots (artificial fools) of all kinds. If a Martian explorer watched the scene, he would not believe his (twelve) eyes and his (twelve) ears: especially if he had been first informed about the human species, and knew that, for long as doubtful tradition, man has self-proclaimed himself a rational animal. In fact, what rationality should we attribute to the bots of this end-campagne, if we do not associate them with carnival rites but infinitely less joyful, rather melted by a cowardy and a anger to blur the despair?
3657	7	We take only the last statements. But who would have made it to the honorable Mollicone, responsible for the culture of the Brothers of Italy, and already this is a news, to declare to allibite Sanmarines interviewers that in Italy already today – I mean, first and foremost that they govern them – “homosexual couples are not legal”? not not? What about civil unions? Maybe the one. Mollicone didn’t make a slope: he just moved forward with the work. Per he wanted to suggest not to take his cover to the letter when he repeats that their government will not touch civil rights. As, they will touch them like this, some of them already dream of the “moral police” of Iran.
3657	9	What about “Joseph” Conte vs Draghi? “Tell me a single measure for which his government will pass to history,” the People’s Advocate said. Per the reduction of taxes and aid to families and that he himself, the Advocate, prevented the Draghi government from approving, making it jump? “Draghi is the only Western leader who has not condemned Putin’s threats, he is a disappeared.” It will not be because Draghi had condemned her before, without waiting for defeats in Ukraine, as he did? I remember a measure for which the governments of Conte will pass to history: not the income of citizenship, but the decrees of security, the guinness of the primates of unconstitutionality.
3657	11	And Berlusconi, who in the attempt to defend the old friend Putin has fooled that, poorly, he had to intervene in Ukraine to put us a “but” government? If he wanted to reassure Europe – the role it has taken over in the future right-wing government – maybe it would be better to be silent. Just as Salvini, disappointed by the idea that Georgia doesn’t want him to laugh the Ministry of the Interior, where they know him only for the socialists, could abstain from attacking Ursula von der Leyen: of course, if Italy will stumble the way of Poland and Hungary, risks the same sanctions, he did well to warn us. Moreover, Salvini could refrain from repeating ten times that our only problem is bills. As if Europe hadn’t promised us 220 billion aid, half of which in depth lost, instead of reminding us that we still have to pay the debts made by Craxi, Andreotti and Forlani later.
3657	13	In summary, God burns those who want to lose: this might be the explanation. But more secularly – secularly it can be said, it’s not yet a crime – other explanations could be brought, that to the Martian will not be enough, but to us humans yes. One is the extraordinary unpreparation of our political class, right-wing species: the only idea that many of the characters mentioned here go to deal with Europe or the U.S. puts the bridges. The other is, more simply, that they take us as scams. The same idea of those who will not go to vote: believing themselves, knowing why, more angry than us.
3658	1	The 'Plan for Peace in Ukraine' by Elon Musk seems written by Orsini
3658	3	The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Elon Musk, doesn’t miss the opportunity to talk about himself: in recent months we’ve had several examples of his protagonist mania, from the spectacularization of the struggle for the acquisition of Twitter – an operation that then ends in the forgetfulness – to the unnecessary battles for “freedom of expression.” Nothing strange: the Muskian tendency to turn back to a kind of postic superomism broke in more than one occasion: for example, a few years ago he was planning to build a mecha (for non-workers: one of those robots that infest Japanese pop culture, type Mazinga) and we all well fixed in memory his famous dispute with Bezos for the colonization of the Moon.
3658	5	But yesterday, Musk raised the shot, choosing to expose himself on the theme of the present, i.e. the Russian invasion war in Ukraine. He did it, he should say, via Twitter, launching a survey to ask his followers whether they were or not agree with the clauses of a not better specified “peace plan” predisposed by himself, which from his point of view should lead to the resolution of hostilities.
3658	7	Russia and Ukraine:
3658	9	Network elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is the will of the people.
3658	11	Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783.
3658	13	– Water supply to Crimea assured.
3658	15	Ukraine is neutral.
3658	17	— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 3, 2022
3658	19	Musk's plan is articulated in four points: in the first, the entrepreneur of South African origin proposes to hold again the farce referendum with which, last week, Russia arbitrarily decided to withdraw four Ukrainian regions, i.e. Luhansk and Donetsk (which Russia already considered independent) and the occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. In Musk’s vision, the vote would be repeated under the United Nations’ egidity, which should be placed as a super part body aimed at witnessing the correct execution of the referendum. In the second (the most discussed at all), the co-founder of Neuralink explicitly supports one of Putin’s historic claims, i.e. the definitive cession of Crimea to Russia. To argue his thesis, Musk notes how Crimea has been part of the Russian territory “from 1783”; however, as it has been emphasized in more reports, it is a version manipulated by the filter of the Kremlin propaganda that does not consider important diplomatic developments, such as the 1994 Budapest Memorandum with which Russia, at the time governed by Boris Nikolaevich El’cin, recognises the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its borders of the time, which included also Crimea. The third point provides that the Ukrainian government agrees to the supply of water to the Russian Crimea, while the fourth claims that Ukraine should remain “neutral.” It is unclear how this “neutrality” should be understood: some argue that, even in this case, Musk has decided to align with Putin’s reasons, suggesting that Zelensky’s government should give up any proposal to join the NATO and the European Union (on the other hand, the Ukrainian will to join the Atlantic Alliance has been used by the Kremlin as an ideological basis to justify the aggression of the former Soviet Republic).
3658	21	Obviously, Musk’s tweet has not passed unnoticed and has triggered the immediate reaction of several political representatives: for example, Ukrainian ambassador in Germany, Andrij Melnyk, replied to Tesla’s CEO in a way that leaves little space to imagination: “Here is my diplomatic response: fanculus,” while Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted: “Care Elon Musk, if someone tries to steal the wheels of a Tesla, this does not make him the legitimate owner of the wheels.”
3658	23	The impression is that the world’s most egorified billionaire has lost the other opportunity to silence.
3659	1	You have heard of virtuous behaviors and you have a desire to become weakened like a rockstar; if then the state is propinarteli, you have the impulse to turn yourself into a sovereign series, at least if you are a liberal and not a communist triangle; but when virtuous behaviors reveal themselves dementia, well, at that point your blood runs directly to the brain. The totality of the post-Soviet dictatorship, but always a bit Soviet, Vladimir Putin, but, first and foremost, the delightful energy grid of the (n)Eurovisionist stamp, we are at the proverbs of the gas: how do we get out of it? That virtuous behavior, for the point. All a race in the barrous of the happy decrease, this found shame of the 5 star sociologist De Masi, who then copied it as a bad plant from the former communist moralism. About ebollition, the physicist (by direct admission) Marxist Giorgio Parisi invites to cook the pasta without gas (they gave him the Nobel, not for anything); the service lights push on the cold that makes weight loss and preserves: the salms, preserves; a magazine more and more of the niche, and I said niche, of the radical left fool invites to do without the ablutions, which would be a recent vision, a waste of western mollic (then they say that these below don’t always vague a Siberian imaginary), and to sweat without embarrassment: with this reiterating that, to the left, a certain overlap even olfative is the constituent of the official sociography of the centers of the rabies.
3659	3	Now, we’re serious: after the Zar tightened the tubes, we’re missing who says 9, who 15 billion cubic meters: really you think of winning the war with the shoot pasta and sleeping in pigiama cappotton and colbacco, Soviet style? Would these be virtuous behaviors? Then there is always a big confusion, the ideological furor runs every logical noise: who makes a race to lower the thermostat to 2 degrees, so that no longer distinguish the external temperature from the domestic (but ministries and public offices will never adapt?Those who dramatically invite to do without the stand-by of the television, that red light that knows how much the devil will consume; on the one hand you read the virtue of scratching the spine to the washing machine when it is out, which has a lot of the mental hygiene department, on the other they invite you to go to the ancient washing room where to straw the stones on the stone as in the high Middle Ages, from there right to the Hospital, where they will put you a paglia mask to prevent the deadly disease of acute and insidious pneumonia.
3659	5	"They are not virtuous behaviors, they are the triumph of deceived gretinism. We thought we had reached the bottom with cover virologists, we began to excavate with climate scientists and energy scientists from moon-park. There is an Italian environmental medicine company that has found the solution to put Putin to the ground: leaving the legal time all year, found that has scratched the pleasure of Sala, the mayor meneghin in arcobaleno socks, and the Pd all. We will not be meteoropaths to oppose us, rather we like here to quote the great Luca Goldoni who already in the 1990s proposed something like this: “When the legal time ends is a trauma, a morning that doesn’t end anymore, a minipomerigge that disappears immediately in the dark, I’ll take it the whole year and in winter I’ll add another two or three hours.” Luca Goldoni and his intuitions, but they have scattered us until yesterday with the incredible buffal, not noticed by the factchecker that they are the reports dogs of the stated journalists, according to which the legal time caused, we don't know how, infarction, depression, killer instincts; now they discomfort the ""circadical rhythm"" to say that it would be good to keep her alive: the behaviors will be virtuous, and also scientific, or more accurately exoteric, but the state (with the information it controls) is foolish."
366	1	"Fourth Republic, Sansonetti reveals: ""In America Zelensky doesn't like it anymore"""
366	3	This is the only way to get a lot of money and get a lot of money and get a lot of money. In the bloody war that is fighting in Ukraine are going to change a lot of things. The balance between the United States and Ukraine appears to have been hit by a breakdown that could have direct consequences on Zelensky. The President of Ukraine does not accept scenarios that may provide for peace talks and agreements with Moscow.
366	5	And the wall against the wall between Russia and Ukraine is leading to an unprecedented escalation. The bridge jumped in the air in Crimea and the Russian repressal with the fire rain over all of Ukraine led the war to a level of hell confrontation.
366	7	And Sansonetti explains well what’s happening especially behind the branches of the White House: “It’s hard to become a pacifist at the age of 55, Conte I haven’t seen him in the square broken with the pacifists, there’s a real fact that in the United States Zelensky doesn’t like much more.” These are the words that raise the veil on the relations between Kiev and Washington. Biden is still trying to send the missiles with a 300km-long route that can also hit the Russian bases. A hesitation that explains the White House's retrose to make the conflict finally explode on a wide scale. And Zelensky is now facing a bit: to continue the counteroffensive to liberate Ukraine by exposing the country to micidial retortions by Moscow or sitting at a table and treating by ending a war that lasts too long.
3660	1	The war. Who is war? Without it there is no more.

3661	1	Greta Thunberg doesn’t like No Everything in Italy. This time, the “green silence”
3661	3	Greta Thunberg, this time doesn’t like the No All of Italy. Because it breaks the fundamental and fundamental taboo of No Everything. Greta says that here and today somewhere energy must come and better from nuclear than from coal.
3661	5	Greta Thunberg doesn’t like it. I don’t like the whole world of No Everything in Italy. We are committed to stopping rigassificators, thermovalorizers, trivels in the sea and on the ground, photovoltaic plants, ships, platforms and tubes... and No All you have to be felt kicked at the back. But how, the holy sent the mission from heaven to save the planet, the Giovanna d’Arc of the sustainable habitat sent to beat in face to the world’s powers their unsustainable inaction, the Che Guevara and together Gandhi of ecology says that better a nuclear today than a coal tomorrow? It’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do. On Greta this time better, much better to practice what the environmentalists without and without but often call with disgrace “assorting silence”. And in fact, not a word, not a piega, and not too many newspapers or second newspapers. This time the silence is green. It is not a censorship no, but ears of merchant yes and even a little bit to keep it silent.
3661	7	The Tabu of Neither This nor That
3661	9	A Greta to silence, to silence because it has violated the founding and fundamental and fundamental taboo of the No All of Italy. They exist for No Everything, it is their reason of life, political life and group and territory life. It is their faith and revelation and mission and the event of No Everything. Only the Bonelli and the Conte (when it is at the opposition). On No Everything a little bit of politics we are campaigning, but No Everything is a form of the soul, a disposition of the mind, a category of the spirit, a religion not so laic. And now Greta Thunberg (tu quoque...) comes to say that the Earth is round. This means that the energy to make mankind go ahead, here and today, must come somewhere.
3661	11	If not from oil, not from gas, not from coal, not from nuclear, not from pools, not from plantations, not from stores, not from power plants, not from wind palm forests, not from photovoltaic panels... then the energy does not come, it does not exist. The priests of no nukes impallide, Greta said the obvious but the obvious denies the liturgy, destabilizes the clergy: he said that the Earth turns around the Sun, he said that here and now shut down the nuclear power plants is wrong. Will I not be possessed by a multinational demon the Greta who says that a sufficient source of energy here and today must be there? For now better the “green silence”, by just nominating it, you risk making a favour to the devil.
367	1	As in Czechoslovakia and Syria, Putin can scratch the ridicule only with the enormous number of strikes.
367	3	To excite the anger of the Russian leaders in front of the sacrilegy of the hit Kerch bridge, the red line, was their sicumera. The Kremlin has claimed dishonor and obsession: it is our repressal, they say after bombing Kyiv, and others have announced it. They claim themselves terrorists, calling others terrorists.
367	5	On the 24th of February the question of the Kerch bridge was on the roof: it was the declared target, the big target of the Ukrainians wishing to reopen the account of Crimea. On the contrary, in addition to a strategic artery between the Russian land farm and Crimea, it was Putin’s superb fan convinced that his bridge was unattackable. The months that passed had not made it to raise the post, since now rejecting that artery would mean for the Ukrainians to break the exchange between the Russian army camped beyond the Dnepr shore in Kherson and its background. To excite the furor of the Russian leaders in front of the sacrilegy of the hit bridge, the red line, was their sicumera. The same which had led them to cross their miracle – even that a trophy, “Putin’s ship”, like “Putin’s bridge” – in view of the coast of Odessa, unable to imagine such an offensive to their power. 
367	8	The same that had exposed uncovered aircraft and ammunition deposits in Saki, Crimea, at the expense of an Ukrainian incursion. If you don’t love the wolf – the Russian leaders go to the blind as the wolf filled with flags. They didn’t just lose ground on the field, after the first advantage of the invasion. They covered themselves with ridiculousness, and they covered themselves with humiliation. A dictatorship does not survive the ridiculous, and to deceive it, it has only one antidote, the enormous number of strikes, the one that dishonors those who do it. It was going so in Cecenia – Anna Politkovskaja had done this, had laughed Putin and his screens, had certified the dishonor of his army. It went so in Syria, where an Anna Politkovskaja was missed or was not translated or had no time to rise before she was killed. Isn’t it a symbolic miracle the promotion on the field of General Surovikin, who shattered under his tank the protesters against the 1991 Moscow coup, the weapons counter-banderer, the tormenter of his commillions, the bellimbust of Cecenia, Donbass and Syria? 
367	12	I was told that the explosion of the Kerch Bridge would mark a dramatic passage in the war. You can try to put yourself in Putin's shadows. (I sometimes try: I have the impression that it’s not impossible or difficult with one like that, and I don’t take any risks, I know that Putin will never know how to put himself in my fault.) He has suffered tremendous, permalignant humiliations as it is. On the day of Kerch’s exit to the Kremlin, they had to ask themselves how to answer. It was not to be afraid that they attacked the famous atomic tactic: they had it too threatened, and the atomic is a weapon as long as a threat remains, once used it really changes the game and makes the bank pass. They had to choose an enormous and unthinkable gesture, which would scatter and terrorise the world. There was a need for imagination, something that looked like the submarine gasdots, something that did night and day and vice versa, that made the world remain with an open mouth. They thought about us, they must have consulted all their skills and skills, and then they decided. To fill with bombs the sky and the land of Ukrainian cities, their lights, their houses, pedestrian bridges and children's game parks. They don’t know how to do anything else because they don’t know how to think anything else. They have also claimed that dishonor and that obsession: it is our rejection, and others have announced it. They claimed terrorists, calling terrorists those who had hit a bridge. 
367	16	Russia has lasted, scattering the peoples subjected to the cost of countless villain, on the rejection of the value of its fighters (including Ukrainians) in the “Great Patriot War”, exalted and abused. Meanwhile, his army was only a devastating elephant: Grozny, Aleppo... Yesterday his hierarchs, wages and mercenaries, congratulated themselves for their special value. Create two, three, many Mariupol, as many as the sister cities of Ukraine are. 
367	20	We are preparing great demonstrations for peace. The Russian repressal (and it’s not just the beginning, he says) is a misleading accident on their way. The alarm and the call for peace mobilization sunnyed in front of the offenses and the bravery and infame of the Russian army, and reanimated in front of the counter-offenses of the Ukrainian forces. In another incident the equidistant pacifism was just thrown to head, logic this time. After being ostinently attentive to the thesis of the war for delegation, he took a blow to support the opposite: that is the devil Zelensky leading the game by dancing to his wing United States of America and Europe. It is the paradoxical result of those who interpret things with the pseudomachiavellic criterion of the proxy war. And I cannot recognize that in a commitment to life and death like that of the Ukrainian resistance the responsibility is at least – at least – mutual. 
367	24	Zelensky had to be “exfiltrated” on the first day. Decides not to. It is the cause of the confidence that the Ukrainians firmly grant him. It is not an investment for the future, for the time of peace and the return of politics and democracy. It is the treaty of being on the side of those who, voted by them, are on their side, at this cost. It is not necessary for them, and so much less for us, to love or hate Zelensky. A true worship of personality lies in the transmission of hatred and sharp that encourages its enemies among us. 
367	26	The Ukrainians claim to fight for Europe and democracy and its idea of freedom: but the Ukrainians and the Ukrainians fight first and at all costs, for their freedom, for their own city. You need to imagine what you can endure in your city. In Kyiv, they feared that other missiles would cause water, gas, and light to be missing. It has been missing in Sarajevo for years. 
368	1	The Antarctica and the excessive catastrophe on the collapse of ice
368	3	In recent weeks, alarming news has emerged on the forefront of climate change: one of Antarctic’s most important glaciers, according to the report, could actually break down within a few years. A particular concern would be the dissolution of the Thwaites ice, which could help raise the sea level by 25 percent compared to the current levels. The study was conducted by the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, and the British University of Birmingham, published in the journal Nature Geoscience. The researchers examined the samples collected during ocean perforation projects, searching for fossils of small lipid molecules (fat) produced by organisms similar to bacteria and consisting of a single cell, the archaea.
368	5	"According to Professor Steven Koonin, however, professor at the New York University and researcher at the Hoover Institution, these are alarms that do not take into account the complexity of the matter. As the tutor emphasizes in the Wall Street Journal, the cause of the specific Thwaites ice event remains unknown, in part because the time of the quick withdrawal has not yet been determined. It probably happened more than 70 years ago, if not several centuries ago. How much is enough to encourage many media to write that “a Florida-sized ice is disintegrating faster than you thought.” A correct title, Koonin observes, would be: ""The Thwaites ice is retreating less quickly today than in the past."""
368	7	The truth about Antarctic studies
368	9	"Another study taken into consideration by Koonin and titled ""Antarctic Peninsula warming triggers enhanced basal melt rates throughout the West Antarctica, published in Science Advanced by researchers of the Environmental Science and Engineering and Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology of Pasadena (the famous CalTech), created a new climate model that would explain the impact of a hot coastal current called Antarctic Coastal Current; the latter would be responsible for the dissolution of ice platforms around the Antarctic coast, catching hot water to the ice base. As the professor emphasizes on Wsj, however, since ""global climate models are not detailed enough to describe the ocean near the coast, the researchers have built a special model to demonstrate their idea."" It is to be taken into account, in this context, “the complexity and variability of changes in the Antarctic glaciary.”"
368	11	The teacher’s accusation: “Studies used to make alarms”
368	13	"Although this fact is kept in mind from the study on the ice disintegration in Antarctica, many media have wanted to draw the eye to climate disaster by publishing titles such as ""the Antarctic ice disintegration could be 40 percent faster"" with the absurd statement that ""a huge tsunami would flood New York City and beyond, killing millions of people. London, Venice and Mumbai would also become aquars.” A more accurate title would be: ""The ocean currents that connect the Antarctic glaciers could accelerate its disintegration."" All this without denying that climate change is in place, but without, on the other hand, falling into the useless catastrophic rhetoric that sees the end of the world imminent."
368	15	"As Koonin explains, in fact, the studies spread in recent weeks “illustrate the progress made in understanding a terribly complex mix of ice, ocean, earth and time, with intelligent methods to deduce past conditions and sophisticated computerized models to show potential future scenarios. These articles describe science with accuracy and appropriate warnings, but it’s a pity that the media pass the research to give the alarm. This denies the public’s right to make informed decisions on climate action.” Words that seem to be a reminder and a monit to those who are constantly calling for ""science"" and with a certain catastrophe risks only to banalize much more complex topics."
369	1	All efforts to avoid the disaster. Other to the Party of War
369	3	The Russian bombs on Ukrainian cities, shortly from the Ukrainian attack on the Crimean Bridge, show in the flesh and blood of the victims what was already obvious to those who wanted to reason. This is a war that no one can win as he proclaims. Ukraine cannot hope to return to the border before 2014, taking back Donbass and Crimea. Russia can’t believe to extend the whole East of Ukraine to the Dnepr and then keep it despite the hostility of a consistent part of the population, the guerrilla of the Ukrainians, the opposition of the whole West. With this war all forgive, only one wins: the party of the war at all.
369	5	The party that exists and is strong, as the recent events show. The United States, which has invested $66 billion in weapons and financial support to support Ukraine, was sending obvious signals to Zelensky and his own. The revelations, which are usually relied on the New York Times, on the responsibility of Kiev’s secret services in the murder of Aleksandr Dugin’s daughter and the Crimean Bridge attack were a clear call to caution, even because they came after the (prudent but significant) statements by Joe Biden and the Secretary of State Blinken on the possibility of a dialogue with Russia. Zelensky and his friends did not hear the right, relying on the unconditional support of the United States and the push of Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltics, the countries that most of all, in Europe, want to take the opportunity to cut the nails to the Russian bear.
369	7	And a party of the total war grows and prosperes also in Russia, in the shadow of the failure of Putin’s strategy, which thought to invade Ukraine with a reduced contingent of contractual volunteers, without ‘disturbing’ the normal Russian citizens. It was the philosophy of the'special military operation' that now many would like to replace with a war without brakes or limits. They are the usual Kadyrov (the Czech leader who supplied thousands of soldiers) and Prigozhin (the founder of the Wagner mercenary army), who have credits to recover. But also the environments of the security services and the National Guard, the body of 300,000 men created by Putin in 2016.
369	9	The one and the other, with a loud voice or whispering in the corridors, ask for the resignation of the Minister of Defense Shoigu and Chief of State Major Gerasimov to put the President under pressure. The bombings of yesterday, more than a revenge for the Bridge attack, are what Putin had to grant to influential and unfavourable sectors of his own system of power.
369	11	There is only one way to oppose a degeneration that lasts for nine months and is now even predicting the use of the atomic bomb: to give life and political strength to a peace party. We have made a few in this period. Six months ago we said that Russia was ending the missiles, and only yesterday it launched 90 missiles on Ukraine.
369	13	And we predicted a rapid collapse of the Russian economic and social system, while now analysts predict a very unsoluble decline of 4.5 percent of its GDP. Without new ideas, the conflict will last long and produce colossal disasters. We know that the war was not inevitable but it responds to the clearly foolish Kremlin's plan to end the American century. We know who is the aggressor and who attacked him.
369	15	But repeating it without doing anything is now a self-consolatory mantra. We need to end the unnecessary struggle. And to do so, it is indispensable a resolute initiative of Europe, which leads to the increasingly obvious doubts of the United States and the very obvious discomfort of Vladimir Putin. It is time for Italy, Germany and France to wake up and return to the role that history has assigned them. It will be a disaster anyway.
