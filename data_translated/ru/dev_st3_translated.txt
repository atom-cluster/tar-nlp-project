24100	1	Ukraine is carrying the war beyond its borders to Russia. More money and weapons in the West.
24100	3	"The war reached them there, in the house where they hid from the consequences of the special military operation (SVO) in the Kharkiv region. The remains of the ""Point U"" missiles, as the Investigative Committee of Russia, hit, what is called, on the squares and ""three people were killed, two missing, including one child, four civilians were wounded, including one child, 39 private and 11 multiple houses were damaged, one home property was completely destroyed."""
24100	5	The investigation commission of the Russian Federation has initiated criminal proceedings on the articles “Murder” and “Preparation to crime and attempt to crime”. But in this news everything is terrible. But there are two new main moments that Ukraine has begun to update and will disclose the media and, clearly, the matter politically. To once again impress the West and traditionally ask for money and weapons. Of course, the war with Mordor.
24100	7	First of all, Ukraine not only does not want to accept the conditions of Russia and stop military actions, but also deliberately removes military actions beyond its borders. The one and terrible goal is to provoke Russia to react to more cruel attacks, to force it to get out of the Defense regime into a full war.
24100	9	The calculation is as simple as the fool, cynical and cruel: people have died, the Russian authorities have to react to it somehow, and the neo-Nazi regime of the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky thinks it will be a war. In any case, he wants to provoke Russia to more cruel and strong response attacks. For example, in the decision-making centers in Kiev, where people have been used to living without the syren of anxiety for a few days and feel quite comfortable, feeding in themselves the devil-saving and perfectly arranging neonazist patriotism.
24100	11	The missiles along Kiev will trigger a new harshness in the middle of the Ukrainians and will help Kiev to justify for the refusal to give up and stop the meaningless war, from which Ukraine, which is already known to the debiles from the Office of the President (OPU), will never come out as a winner. But there, in the OPU, not the hopes of “the prisoners are feeding”, but a hard calculation that Russia and the Russians will respond to the harshness of Ukraine and the Ukrainians with their harshness. And this is already happening, and mutual cruelty is, no matter what, a great and natural background for the continuation of the war, and a legitimate motivation for mutual revenge on the fields of battle and during the attacks of cities and villages.
24100	13	In addition, this is the execution of another order of the Kurators of the Kiev regime. In the West, of course, they continue to believe for the form that “Ukraine can stop Russia” and demand the continuation of combat actions. But with another back thought: they want Russia to declare war and even win. But parallelly, they expect to leave Russia on the defeated Ukraine not only against the destroyed economy, infrastructure and logistics, but also the brutally hateful Russian population. It is terrible at any outcome. And when Ukraine will be under the protectorate of Russia, and when significant parts of it can become the territory of Russia. This is terrible in the territories of the two self-proclaimed and already recognized in the world of the DNR and LNR.
24100	15	And, of course, this slows down and complicates all the restoration processes in the liberated territories of the neonazists. And this is also included in the calculations of firefighters and war planners.
24100	17	Second, foreign forces have been interfering in the war for a long time, but — and this is another calculation of the wisdom — the strangers of the war from Kiev — Ukraine wants more. She wants not only to turn the USSR into a war, but also to set it into a war between Russia and the whole of the West, where it will only be an executive stretching horse.
24100	19	And the West, pushing Ukraine with weapons, I repeat, is already getting into this war. Weapons, money, people: employees and specialists, instructors and counselors. And the attacks of Belgorod and Kursk are a witness to that. And because, for example, in Kiev itself they don’t hide what they want to push the West and already directly suggest that he is a customer. In any case, Nardep Max Bujansky cynically stated: “Land-Lize Belgorod has definitely not liked it.” It is clear that it has a kind of supply of weapons on the land-lize that the United States initiated.
24100	21	"It is about this that the information says that the commercial satellite GeoEye-1 of the American company Maxar took the recording of Belgorod on Thursday, June 30, that is, three days before the missile strike of the Armed Forces. In addition, according to RIA News, the U.S. satellites Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 also shot the Belgorod area weeks earlier. Divorced that is. To coordinate the fire in peaceful cities. After all, where the army attacked, there were no military facilities. At first, the attacks were to kill civilians and strengthen the remaining. Three ""Tokka-U"" missiles were with cassette head parts, so there were more victims."
24100	23	And the U.S. satellites on the side of the U.S. Air Force is a serious international problem. The first deputy chairman of the international committee of the Russian Federation Council Vladimir Jabarov has already stated that Moscow has the right to impose sanctions against the U.S. company Maxar if it is confirmed that its satellite was used to film Belgorod before the attack on it by Ukrainian troops.
24100	25	And the head of Roskosmos Dmitry Rogozin warned at the end of June this year: “I can say that all the leading private companies, such as, for example, the same Maxar, are now working exclusively on the formation of a single data cloud that is used by NATO to transmit specific information to the Ukrainian armed forces. In fact, the entire conglomerate of private and state orbit groups is now working exclusively on our enemy.”
24100	27	And in addition to intelligence for attacks on Belgorod and Kursk, commercial satellites, according to RIA Novosti, produced a photograph and other objects that after a few days were attacked by For example, the island of the Snake in the Black Sea, the bull platforms of the Black Sea oil gas and the Novoshakhtin oil processing plant in the Rostov region. This is the involvement of the United States in the war.
24100	29	The U.S. military attacks directly on Russia should stimulate the West to another one – to complete and complete replacement of Ukrainian weapons not to the Soviet old, but to the new NATO. This will immediately lead the war to a new technological level and push the arms race. Because, at least, it will provoke Russia to use more new types of weapons — tanks, artillery, drones, etc.
24100	31	And the attacks were made by Ukraine very timely – after the “Great Seven” and NATO summits, where the collective West promised to provide Ukraine with even more weapons.
24100	33	There is also a negative political and propaganda effect from the attacks on the Kursk and Belgorod regions. They were imposed on the day it became known that it was completely liberated from the neonazists of the LNR. This was to Russian President Vladimir Putin by the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation General Sergey Shoigu. The head of the LNR, Leonid Paseknik, called July 3 a “new day of victory.”
24100	35	"But the attacks on Russia stimulated a new eruption of Cannibal patriotism in Kiev among politicians and politicians of the very different kind. Not even the almost forgotten grandmother of Ukrainian politics and the leader of the party ""Batkivščina"" Yulia Tymoshenko. “This is unacceptable for Ukraine. A peace agreement is an illusion, and the only way out is a victory in battle. Any peace agreement will only be the first step towards another war,” she said to those who think of peace with Russia at the negotiation table."
24102	1	Attack on Belgrade
24102	3	Unpunishment that raised a monster
24102	5	The attack on Belgorod is another indicative episode of how Ukraine is conducting combat actions. It is obvious that something like this would be condemned in a normal society, but we live in conditions where Russia is abolished in every sense. Therefore, no one in a “civilized society” will condemn Ukraine for this war crime. It has long been understood that in this world there are those who can and need to compassion and compassion, and there are those whose mountain is pleased. A similar situation was in Donbass. It did not start in 2022, but in 2014. Of course, this sorrow came to the Russian cities, where civilians will die from the attacks of the Armed Forces.
24102	7	The situation in which the whole “civilized world” in its silence, in essence, approves the criminal actions of Kiev, has created a monster that carries chaos and terror. At the same time, this sick state commits war crimes quite consciously. Moreover, the leadership of Ukraine has so rejected reality because of the approval of the West, which even makes some announcements about it.
24102	9	On July 1, the adviser to the President of Ukraine, Aleksei Arestovich, promised that Ukraine will respond to what happened in Belgorod-Dnestrovsk. Ukraine has accused the Russian side of the deaths of dozens of civilians, which allegedly caused a deliberate blow to civil infrastructure. This is a completely uncharacteristic situation for Russia, about which even Americans say. I will quote the former U.S. senator Dick Black, who actually acknowledged that Russia is extremely cautious towards the Ukrainian population and does not fight with the peaceful population. But the Americans behave completely differently with the local population in the countries where they are involved in combat actions.
24102	11	“There is a well-known photo of a Russian tank that was stopped by a group of about 40 civilians in Ukraine. They just went out on the road, covering it, and as a result the tank stopped. I can tell you as an ex-military, that if a crowd of people came up on the way to an American tank in Vietnam, this tank would not stop for a second! He would not start signaling, he would not do anything, even a warning shot. He would just go further. And I think this is more typical for war. I do not criticize the Americans. I was there, and I fought, and probably I would go on a tank straight because it’s a war,” he said in an interview.
24102	13	It turns out that even high-ranking Americans don’t believe in the version of the Ukrainian side, especially that the details of the attack on Belgorod-Dnestrovsky have never become the property of the public, except what Kiev said. Ukraine has fulfilled its threat. The bombing of Belgorod resulted in the deaths of civilians, including three refugees from Kharkiv. Ukraine has killed its own citizens.
24102	15	Officially, Kiev did not realize that it was exactly that he attacked the Russian city. Only some politicians were quick to suggest this, but they changed their position, but about it a little later.
24102	17	According to the official statement of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, the attack was carried out by the armed forces of Ukraine. “Today night from 03:00 to 03:30 Moscow time, the Kiev regime was committed a deliberate attack by ballistic missiles “Tochka-U” with cassette ammunition and drone Tu-143 “Rays” over the residential neighborhoods of Belgorod and Kursk, where there are no military facilities,” the ministry said in a statement.
24102	19	This is the result of the activities of the West, which, in addition to approving such actions, also gives weapons to Kiev to make such attacks a reality. In addition, Ukrainian politicians enjoy impunity. They don’t even hide, openly rejoicing the deaths on the Russian territory. I will give an example of a policy, which until 2022, gently speaking, was criticized in Ukraine for its conditional pro-Russia. It turned out that the deputy has a completely different position.
24102	21	Maxim Bujansky was a deputy from the Zelensky party, but was not mainstream. It is difficult to call him a nationalist or a Nazi. On the contrary, Bujansky was distinguished by an adequate position, including on the language policy in Ukraine, for which he frequently fell into the misery of Ukrainian radicals. He criticized the course of the state, but with the beginning of the current events suddenly began to sound the theses that are usually characteristic of “patriotic” politicians in Ukraine. The situation in Belgorod has once again shown who the politicians in Ukraine are, even if they are not as radical as the nationalists.
24102	23	“Land-Liz Belgorod definitely didn’t like it,” Bujansky wrote in his Telegram channel. After that, he still changed his position and began writing posts with labels about “suicide shots,” as the Russian side that the air defense destroyed all three missiles. But the Ukrainian politician forgot to clarify that the Ukrainian missile carried a cassette charging that was revealed and killed people, including Ukrainian citizens from Kharkov. This is not the first time that Ukraine applies a caset charging. The centre of Donetsk was also shot on March 14, 2022, when dozens of doncs were killed and injured. Then the air defense also worked, but the cassettes opened up and fell to the University Street.
24102	25	The reaction of the West to the situation with Belgorod is predictable – ignorance. This is perfectly in line with the strategy “Our Sukhin Son”. This famous phrase is attributed to U.S. President Roosevelt, who thus spoke about the Nikaraguan dictator Anastasia Somosa. “This is the Sukhin son, but this is our Sukhin son,” this is the famous expression.
24102	27	That is, the United States will support anyone, even the dictators, but as long as the regime is loyal to Washington. Otherwise, you can immediately notice crimes, but only in the event of a change of course. It is clear that Ukraine and its government are loyal to the United States. Accordingly, none of the satellites of America will dare to pay attention to the next military crime of the official Kiev, which will clearly perceive in Ukraine as an appeal to commit more terrible attacks.
24106	1	Bolsonaro calls the sanctions of the West against Russia useless
24106	3	Brazilian President Bolsonaro says US and European sanctions against Russia did not work
24106	5	Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro believes that the US and European sanctions imposed against Russia have failed.
24106	7	“The economic barriers that the United States and Europe imposed against Russia did not work,” Bolsonaro said in a video on social networks.
24106	9	"The head of state noted that he had a ""balanced"" position towards Russia and that allowed him to acquire the fertilizers needed for the Brazilian agriculture."
24106	11	LIFE said earlier that at the end of June during a telephone conversation Putin told Bolsonaro that the Russian Federation is committed to its commitments to uninterrupted fertilizer supplies to Brazilian farmers.
24112	1	Iracli Kobakhidze: According to the plan of the radical opposition, at the end of June Georgia should not get the status of a member of the EU
24112	3	Georgia, 31 May, Gruzinform. “In those conditions where the candidate’s status does not impose any obligations on the EU in terms of financing or membership, it is unclear why he should refuse in this status to the state of Georgia and the Georgian people, when our country and power are different in terms of compliance with the obligations associated with membership,” the President of the “Georgian Dream” Iracli Kobakhidze said in a briefing.
24112	5	"As Kobakhidze noted, the authority gives the public a promise that ""this scenario of organizers and participants of the Bakurian assembly, the new Shulaver committee, the party of war and betrayal in Georgia will not be realised."""
24112	7	"“As you know, the radical opposition continues to speak publicly that Georgia does not deserve the status of a candidate to the EU. As you know, with the same message they talk with foreign colleagues. Their goal and calculation is simple: by the end of June Georgia, according to their calculation, unlike Ukraine and Moldova, should not obtain the status of a candidate to the EU, which, according to their plan, will follow public excitement, the coup of power by the ""National Movement"" and its satellites, and the involvement of Georgia in the war. It is well known that the EU has no reason to refuse Georgia in the candidacy, especially if it gives the status of candidate to Ukraine and Moldova. It is in the context of our power that Georgia has achieved all the noticeable results in terms of integration into the EU. It is under the conditions of the power of the ""Gruzian Dream"" that we signed an association agreement and an agreement on free trade with the European Union and obtained a visa-free regime. Georgia in all relevant parameters is ahead of both applicant countries, which no one can deny. In addition, Georgia has already fulfilled 45 percent of its commitments under the association agreement, which is an unprecedented result. According to this data, Georgia is not only ahead of Ukraine and Moldova, but also some countries already having the candidate status. In addition, granting the candidate status, the EU does not spend a single euro more on Georgia. As it is known, the candidate status does not obligate the EU to allocate any additional funding to Georgia,” Kobakhidze said."
24112	9	In addition, he said that the EU does not assume any obligations to join the country within a certain period of time after the status of a candidate is granted.
24116	1	A covid-to seems Ukrainian: a sensational investigation of the British 
24116	3	As the British conservative newspaper The Exposé revealed, three months before the world learned about COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Defense paid for contracts for its “investigation.”
24116	5	Remember: On February 11, 2020, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Hebraysus, announced the award of the new coronavirus spread from China, the official name COVID-19. To this day, it was already known about a doctor from the reception department of the Central Hospital of Uhanah Ay Feng, to whom a 65-year-old man with an unusual respiratory infection was brought on December 18, 2019. Before the illness, the man worked on the Huanai seafood market. It was the first patient with an unusual respiratory infection to be examined, tested and discovered the same coronavirus. It was her discovery that the ophthalmologist of the same hospital, Li Wenlan, tried to disclose. He the outbreak of a new virus in the WeChat chat on December 31, 2019, the next day the Huanang market was closed, and on January 10, Lee Wendy had symptoms of this viral infection. He died on February 6 in the morning... But, I repeat, only on February 11 the world knew the name of the new disease – COVID-19.
24116	7	Why is it so important? Yes because, let’s repeat, another three months before the end of the year, the U.S. Department of Defense paid the “COVID-19 Research” (COVID-19 Research) contract... in Ukraine.
24116	9	The revealed details of the contract are very clear, and if they correspond to reality, then the questions will not happen anywhere.
24116	11	According to the U.S. government documents, on November 12, 2019, the Pentagon paid a contract with Labyrinth Global Health INC “COVID-19 Research”, which was carried out in Ukraine and was actually part of a much larger contract with Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp “Programme to Reduce Biological Threat in Ukraine”.
24116	13	And that’s five weeks before a 65-year-old man who worked on the seafood market, Juan, was brought to the reception vacation to Ay Feng. And three months before the world learned what the terrible attack came from China was called? It’s easy to understand that it’s possible only if Labyrinth Global Health INC already knew about the existence of Corona Virus Disease- 2019, that is, the disease that caused the coronavirus 2019-nCoV...
24116	15	The contract with Labyrinth Global Health INC existed not only on paper. Let’s look at the official open source of information about the federal spending of the U.S. government, The Exposé suggests: according to the site, as of April 12, 2021, the U.S. government spent on COVID-19 $3.63 trillion. But we are most interested in the expenses for Labyrinth Global Health INC activities, addressed to Kiev. We will easily find them.
24116	17	"Laboratory equipment for Kiev, office furniture for Kiev is quite harmless. But the $369.5 thousand for Labyrinth Global Health INC for the ""Documentation on the Manuscripts of SMEs and the COVID-19 Study"", paid on November 12, 2019, three months before Covid-19 got the official name, are not shocking? And was it not a little shock that we had in our time the information that in Ukraine the U.S. organized three dozen biological laboratories, conducting experiments, including on Ukrainians?"
24116	19	In 14 of them the contractor was Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp: in Kiev, Odessa, Vinice, Uzhgorod, Dnepr, Lviv, Turnopol, Kharkiv, Herson... Only the Herson diagnostic laboratory, built in December 2012, cost the U.S. Ministry of Defense $1,728 822 – spent exclusively in the interests of simple Ukrainians, of course.
24116	21	And the most interesting. The Labyrinth Global Health INC Award was paid on the basis of its activities in Ukraine within the framework of the contract, which began to enter into force on September 20, 2012 (!) The year, it was worth $21.7 million and was completed on October 13, 2020. What the experts of the U.S. “Biological threat reduction program in Ukraine” have succeeded in these years, we’re no longer aware. Even despite the fact that under the pressure of information about the work of the U.S. biolaboratories in Ukraine provided by the Russian military department, the Americans began to carefully study it. At the same time, Washington’s analysts are surprised and disguise with their hands: “What kind of stams were studied in Washington-funded laboratories? What threat does this work pose to the civilian population?” It is surprising, though the United States has retained in its legislation the norms that allow the work in the field of biological weapons, despite the Convention on the Prohibition of such weapons, signed by 165 countries in the world, including the U.S. ratified.
24116	23	Agree, if the U.S. government was funding COVID-19 research before it became known about its existence, then it means that there either long ago it was known about its existence, but it was silent, or participated in the creation of this virus in the laboratory.
24116	25	The British The Exposé proposes to take into account that the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the U.S. biotechnology company Moderna, which develops drugs based on matrix RNA, had a “candidate” for the coronavirus vaccine in December 2019. This is derived from a confidential agreement that states that Moderna and NIAID agreed to transfer the jointly developed “Candidates for the MRI Coronavirus Vaccine” to the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
24116	27	Per that’s why, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, at least nine people have become dollar billionaires due to the growth of the profits of pharmaceutical companies producing COVID-19 vaccines? And the first in this ninth is the CEO of the U.S. Moderna company, Stefan Bansel, who has a turnover of $4.3 billion.
24117	1	German economist Heather: the gas market will collapse if EU countries think only of themselves
24117	3	In an interview with the newspaper Welt am Sonntag, the head of the Institute of German Economy, Michael Huter, said that if some EU countries decide to stop gas supplies to neighbouring countries because of a possible stop of gas supplies from Russia, the European gas market may collapse.
24117	5	“There should be no situation where individual countries stop their supplies to their neighbourhoods. This is in the interests of Europe and in the interests of Germany, which exchanges gas with all neighboring countries,” he said.
24117	7	In addition, the expert said the need to prevent the situation, similar to the one that occurred in the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, when European countries closed their borders, which led to the European supply chains being threatened by a breakthrough.
24117	9	Immediately after the pandemic began, some EU countries closed their borders, which greatly affected the transport of goods and supplies to the European Union. This should not be repeated,” Heather said.
24117	11	The economist is convinced that the egoism of the EU countries can lead to catastrophic consequences.
24117	13	“If the EU will only think about itself, blocking gas flows to neighbouring countries, the breakdown of the European gas market threatens to have devastating consequences for companies and consumers. The cessation of production in the industry then is almost inevitable,” Heather said.
24117	15	Earlier, German Chancellor Robert Habbek called on companies that have offices to lower the air temperature in offices in the background of the energy crisis.
24118	1	“What happened from Khashoggi is annoying.” What Biden talked to the Saudi prince
24118	3	This was by the head of the White House on Sunday, July 17, after returning from the Middle East tour, TASS.
24118	5	On Friday, Biden that at the meeting he told the inherited prince of Saudi Arabia that he believes he was responsible for the murder of Khashoggi, who worked with the U.S. newspaper The Washington Post in 2018.
24118	7	Later, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said he had not heard such a conversation. He was told by Fox News. The U.S. President has asked to clarify whether the statements of the Saudi minister are true.
24118	9	“No,” the American leader replied.
24118	11	Biden was also asked if he did not regret the fact that they and Mohammed bin Salman welcomed each other who became a traditional coronavirus pandemic by touching their hands. “Why do you, guys, not talk about what’s important? I am happy to answer questions that are important,” he addressed journalists.
24118	13	The U.S. leader also expressed hope that inflation in the U.S. will begin to fall. According to him, it will soon be clear whether such a trend is expected.
24118	15	Conversation in Jeddah
24118	17	The fact that Biden did not say he was guilty of the assassination of Khashoggi during his conversations with the hered Prince of Saudi Arabia, Fox News journalist Jacky Heinrich said on Saturday with reference to the kingdom's foreign minister.
24118	19	“Adel al-Jubeir has clearly stated that he has ‘not heard’ how Biden told Mohammed bin Salman that he believes in his responsibility for the assassination of Khashoggi,” a White House spokesman tweeted.
24118	21	The talks with the leadership of Saudi Arabia, on which the Crown Prince was present, the U.S. President held in Jeddah. “We discussed human rights and the need for political reform. As always, I have made it clear that this topic is extremely important to me and to the United States,” Baiden said.
24118	23	“As for the assassination of Khashoggi, I raised this question at the very beginning of the meeting and made clear what I thought about it then and what I think about it now,” he added.
24118	25	One reporter asked how Mohammed bin Salman responded to his words. “He, in fact, said he personally is not responsible for it,” Baiden replied.
24118	27	The U.S. President later noted that he does not regret his previous threats to turn Saudi Arabia into an outland in connection with the assassination of Khashoggi. “I don’t regret anything I’ve said,” he said, stressing that “the thing that came out of Khashoggi is annoying.”
24118	29	The murder of a journalist
24118	31	Muhammad bin Salman al-Saud, the future king of Saudi Arabia, was considered in the U.S. National Intelligence the main guilty of the murder in 2018 of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, known for critical articles about the Riyadh policy.
24118	33	A journalist who has lived in the United States since 2017 and has worked with The Washington Post has been killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of the conflict.
24118	35	In February 2021, the U.S. National Intelligence Director’s apparatus published a report on Khashoggi’s murder, and, according to the U.S. version, the Saudi hered Prince allegedly personally approved the operation as he saw a threat in a journalist. The U.S. administration then announced the introduction of visa restrictions on 76 submitted kingdoms. By being a candidate for the post of head of state, Biden has promised to turn Saudi Arabia into a “exotic country.” In Riyadh, Washington’s conclusions were categorically rejected.
24124	1	Crimea says the reunification of southern Ukraine with Russia is predetermined
24124	3	Crimean Prime Minister's Adviser Krukov said the reunification of the south of Ukraine with Russia was anticipated.
24124	5	The reunification of the liberated regions of the south of Ukraine with Russia is predetermined, the attempts of the Kiev authorities to prevent this are condemned to failure, said RIA Novosti, the head of the Crimea’s advisor on information policy Oleg Krukhov.
24124	7	"Earlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksei Reznikov said in an interview with the British newspaper The Times that Zelensky gave the military order to release the southern territory of the country. For these purposes, ""millions of military forces equipped with Western weapons are gathered."""
24124	9	"The Kiev regime began a policy of terrorism, blockade and evacuation against the civilian population of liberated territories. The official speakers of Kiev are scared by the counter-attack and call on everyone to leave, as they realize that the referendum in the Zaporozhsk and Cherson regions is inevitable and will necessarily be held. The unification of these historically Russian lands with Russia is predetermined and the attempts of the Kiev regime to prevent this are condemned to failure,"" Krukhov said."
24124	11	According to him, the liberated regions according to the example of Crimea will become full-right subjects of the Russian Federation.
24124	13	During the special operation, the Russian military took control of the Herson region and the Priazov part of the Zaporozh region in the south of Ukraine. In the regions, military and civil administrations were formed, rubles were introduced, broadcasting of Russian television channels and radio stations began. The regions announced plans to become subjects of the Russian Federation.
24126	1	Crimea assessed the possibility of reunification of southern Ukraine and Russia
24126	3	Crimean leader’s information policy adviser Oleg Krukov commented on the possibility of reunification of the liberated regions of southern Ukraine and Russia. His words are told by RIA Novosti.
24126	5	Kreuchkov assessed the possibility of reunification of Ukrainian regions with the Russian and said that this decision is predetermined. Therefore, Kiev’s attempt to prevent this procedure is condemned to failure, the politician is confident.
24126	7	"The Kiev regime began a policy of terrorism, blockade and evacuation against the civilian population of liberated territories. The official speakers of Kiev are scared by the counter-attack and call on everyone to leave, as they realize that the referendum in the Zaporozhsk and Cherson regions is inevitable and will necessarily be held. The unification of these historically Russian lands with Russia is predetermined and the attempts of the Kiev regime to prevent this are condemned to failure,"" he said."
24126	9	He added that the liberated regions use the experience of Crimea and will be part of Russia as full-righteous entities.
24126	11	Crimea was, is and will be Russian. forever. Zaporojje and Herson are already waiting in a big and friendly Russian family,” Krukov concluded.
24126	13	Earlier, Ukrainian Defence Minister Aleksei Reznikov said that the president of the country, Vladimir Zelensky, ordered to take the south of the country. The corresponding task was received by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU). “We understand that politically this is extremely necessary for our country,” Reznikov stressed.
24127	1	We have a painful procedure – to sweat the wound with salt or to treat it with iodine.
24127	3	"Successful state coupes in Georgia have been carried out twice in its modern history. Initially, in 1991-92, the power of Zviad Gamsahurdi was overturned by arms, and in 2003 as a result of the ""colored revolution"" he was forced to resign by Edward Shevardnadze."
24127	5	The first coup expelled from his homeland, Zviad Gamsahurdi, said: “The coup in Georgia took place with the approval of U.S. President Bush and with the direct participation of the Secretary of State Baker.” No one has yet appreciated the second coup – Shevardnadze went to the tomb, publicly so nothing bad against the Americans and didn’t say (and who better knew him where, in which state, in which country were planned and planned state coupes, “colored revolutions”, ordered political murders, terrorist acts and thousands of other misfortunes and misfortunes).
24127	7	And just a few days ago, President Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton suddenly made a sensational recognition, telling about how the United States planned and carried out “colored revolutions” in one or another country. The recognition was followed by a noise in the world. “State coupes are a weapon that the United States has been using for decades,” the Chinese newspaper Global Times wrote. The article also says: “The U.S. is eating the bitter fruits of the so-called democracy that the White House spread abroad.” The position of the U.S. political elite is assessed as selfish, and John Bolton’s statements are called unconscious. Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Dmitry Polanski said that “these revelations of Bolton are a recognition of a severe violation of the UN Charter, with which the world has no right to agree. Bolton’s words should serve as the basis for international investigation.”
24127	9	Despite such a sharp reaction, Bolton did not, as they say, give a backbone. He said, “Many people don’t understand what to do to protect the United States.” According to the former counselor, “it does not matter what other states think about this issue.” It turns out that the United States is not so democratic in its essence by the principle of Machiavelli, according to which “the goal justifies the means.” I think, after all this, it’s unnecessary to ask – who is planning another state coup in Georgia? And, among other things, the answer to this main question was given not now, but very long ago, although some uncertainty remains: “Why is it still right now? Or – what do they don’t like in the actions and decisions of today’s Georgian authorities?”
24127	11	Let’s try to get to this problem from another end. That is, let’s start with the opposite: and no state coup in Georgia is not planned? No one will answer you this question directly. The initiators will not be to admit: yes, we are planning a state coup in Georgia. However, it is worth more carefully looking at and listening to statements, actions, moods, positions, carefully tracking the logic of events, how all of this, whether we want it or not, will lead us to an irreversible conclusion – someone somewhere has long thought about organizing a state coup in Georgia. It is sufficient to remind some of the general trends on which the political events in our country have evolved in recent times, and they in themselves will serve as a sparking fact that Georgia is trying to get into the fool with all the strengths:
24127	13	1 Send to Georgia Saakashvili, in the period when a large-scale anti-Russian provocation was planned in Ukraine (documents confirming that the West planned a dirty anti-Russian provocation are now in the hands of Russia);
24127	15	2nd The demonstrative refusal of the European Union to grant Georgia the candidate status;
24127	17	Three The attempt to raise mass protests against the current Georgian leadership on the grounds of refusal to grant the country the candidate status, demands for the resignation of the government and the creation of the so-called technical government;
24127	19	4. Campaign launched by the opposition to open the “second front” against Russia in Georgia;
24127	21	5 Direct or indirect involvement in these processes of the embassy and personal ambassadors operating in Georgia.
24127	23	From this list of events it is clear that the existing “fifth column” within Georgia acts in accordance with the forces from the outside. Why, it is questioned, the European Union did not give us the status of a candidate country, if it considered it worthy of its staying in a state of war, damaged in the fascist ideology, widespread corruption and thousands of other obvious defects to Ukraine, if it did not replace it for the position of Moldova that is in nothing better than us? What would the European Union lose, or what responsibility would the European Union take, by giving us just one word (candidate)? It does not imply absolutely any obligations for the European Union, but why did they then dare us this empty irritation that doesn’t talk about anything and doesn’t give anything? The answer is unclear: thus (the Georgian people are drawn with the prohibited fruit) they tried to provoke in Georgia a revolutionary situation, which, of course, immediately captured the existing within us diversion groups of the West, who attacked the Georgian authority, whose fault, as it was said, Georgia, you see, lost a chance of a candidate status.
24127	25	This is like a provocation on the notes! To which the diversion activity of the U.S. and European embassy was organically overwhelmed, which worsened the situation even more. You’ll just see what stupid statements the U.S. Ambassador Kelly Degnan made after the negative attitude of our authorities to the issue of joining the sanctions established against Russia. The Prime Minister of Georgia, Iracli Garibashvili, said that Georgia will not join these sanctions, as it will cause damage not to Russia, but to our own country, and the commentary of the U.S. Ambassador was as follows: “Today, in such a situation, it is very important to demonstrate unity with regard to the Russian aggression that kills thousands of Ukrainian citizens and destroys Ukrainian cities. The aim of the sanctions is to force Russia to change its actions. I want to emphasize that no one will ask the Georgian government to establish bilateral sanctions. What we expect from all countries is the coordination of efforts in the interest of international sanctions against Russian aggression.”
24127	27	How do you like? “We will not ask you to establish bilateral sanctions, but in sanctions matters coordination is necessary,” said the ambassador. And if Georgia stops and behaves wrong as Ms. Dagnan teaches us, she has the answer: “If the country does not join international sanctions, the results of this will be manifested!” What could she say about that? Please don’t join, and yours will take? No of course. I mean you will regret. And this is a direct threat, obvious and uncolored.
24127	29	The current Georgian leadership is unacceptable for the West, because, unlike the Saakashvili authority, it refused to join the Western sanctions and engage in war with Russia. This is where the dog is stumbled and the main reason for such unhappiness of the collective West to the current ruling power. The West needs such power here and such leaders, who, like Saakashvili and Zelensky, will declare war on Russia and leave their people, leaving them face to face with it. At the same time, the West also needs people who will in every way encourage their power to a military march against Russia and will require radical action from it.
24127	31	The fact that the current Georgian leadership categorically does not fit the West was convincingly confirmed by the U.S. ambassador when commenting on the open letter to her deputy Mikhail Kavelašvili. She wrote, “Truly, I couldn’t read this letter, full of false fantasies and conspiratory theories.” Is it possible after such words to doubt the obvious negative attitude of the ambassador to the deputy Cavalashvili and to his letter? No, this attitude does not cause any doubts. In the same comment, the ambassador discusses: “This is really strange, and, in addition, I want to emphasize that this narrative of the parliamentary, a former member of the ‘Gruzian Dream’, about the involvement of Georgia in the war in a strange way is referred to with the narrative of the members of the party...”. Clearly by the diplomat’s mouth, and you will not say, I will not carry the deputy Cavellashvili as I will not carry the whole “Gruzian dream” because they act according to the same narrative.
24127	33	It is quite obvious that the West has finally hated the “Georgian Dream” because it does not intend to join the sanctions against Russia, nor does it intend to start a war against it, as it will destroy Georgia. However, the question is whether Georgia will die or not the West is not concerned, just as it is not concerned and whether Ukraine will die or not. They need Georgia in the war with the Russian Federation, they need all new and new provocations against Russia.
24127	35	Oh, how much they need today Mikhail Saakashvili! They need it here as air, and that’s why it should be assumed that it was illegal, in a cargo container passed into Georgia. If the former president had the opportunity to break up, he would not only invade Tshinvali, but would also go to Moscow with his marshals and generals – Giga Makarashvili, Digmelashvili (please forgive, but the name I couldn’t remember), Mishy Mshvildadze, Tak Charkviani, Salome Samadashvili, Ekoy Herschelidze, Gubaz Sanikidze, Dato Akubardi and his wife... He would go, and even if he did not force Russia to throw its hair, Georgia would in any case sacrifice, and in what time! But that’s what our “strategic partner” and the representative of his servant needs. What is incomprehensible?The!
24127	37	Judge Lasha Chikvade, who brought the accusation sentence to Nike Gvarami, expressly stated that after that he was immediately contacted by a representative of the U.S. Embassy, who transmitted: the ambassador is interested in why he, the judge, brought the accusation sentence and why he applied as a punishment measure the imprisonment. How do you like such “interest” by the sentence of the ambassador of the ruling world democracy?! They are constantly claiming us about the independence of the court, but it was worth these claims to insist on trending interest in the particular case as they organized the judge investigation. Not anywhere in your country, but in another country.
24127	39	That’s what the American “democracy” teaches us. You have no idea why they were interested in the fate of this Gvarami? Yes, because, if a little periphrase the famous statement of Franklin Roosevelt concerning the Nikaraguan dictator of Somos, Gvaramia may be a Sukhin son, but their (West) Sukhin son. No one was able to force the Russians with such toxic rusophobia as Gvaramia. That’s why they were so “pronounced” to his isolation in prison; it was so pronounced to such a level that the ambassador arranged the judge a thief breakdown. You will not say differently.
24127	41	Nick Guaramia himself also responded on Facebook in connection with all this. He was angry and angry, of course, not because the U.S. ambassador dared to sweep his unwashed hands into the decision of the Georgian court, but because all of this seems to lead to the discreditation of our strategic partner: “This fact of discreditation and chantage of our main strategic partner, which should be regarded as part of the open anti-West campaign of the Georgian Dream, has been deceived and unprecedented by the authorities.
24127	43	What anti-West campaign are you talking about, the angry God and the peculiar Guaramia! For you, if the power protects its people and its country from the involvement in the war, is it an anti-West campaign?! Or what can be said about the West itself, which cannot find in Ukraine other supports than Zelensky and Arachamia, and in Georgia is forced to put hope on such as Saakashvili and you! Nothing, they will gradually “bind” not only you, but also the unconsciously deprived false informers in the head of some Gogasvili, who have eaten you and your journalists, and then all your evils and lies will rise on the surface; and all around will rise from the fears of your flesh and the smell of your souls. No ambassador will help you. She has already given up with her head, like you, and she will have to leave our country. However, as long as this happens, you will surely fight a lot more, you will try to destroy our Country again, dive it into a devastating war hurricane, you will want to arrange a coup d’état and again be saturated with Georgian blood – you have openly promised from the TV: “I will drink your blood! I will drink your blood.” At the same time, with a disgusting grimax he absorbed some fluid of blood color. Who knows, maybe it really was blood? Everything can be expected from you.
24127	45	This is your essence – the representatives of the most dirty forces of the West in Georgia, for whom the last times are coming, and therefore you are desperately mastering with the tails. Everything is empty, the age of your masters is over and your time is over. See, Joe Biden will finish the same as Boris Johnson and Mario Draghi. In the West, the people are gradually awakening, as they tremble in Georgia. People in Europe and America have already begun to realize that hatred towards Russia in fact means hatred towards their own peoples; that the way of war and confrontation has caught the West into a fool, from which he will not be able to escape; that Saakashvili, Zelensky and similar creations are a malignant tumor on the body of politics, which must urgently be removed and burned. This is the process that is ongoing in Ukraine. To activate it is also attempted in Georgia – we cannot stop in any way, because the malignant tumor in the face of Saakashvili and Gvaramia we have already cut out, and it remains only to sweat this place with salt or burn with iodine. What you do, the procedure is painful but mandatory.
24130	1	The State Duma has forecasted Kiev's devastating response in case of an attack on the Crimean Bridge
24130	3	In the event of Kiev’s attempt to hit the Crimean Bridge, Russia’s response will be devastating and will not leave Ukraine a chance to recover. This statement was made by the Deputy of the State Duma Mikhail Sheremet, his words are by RIA Novosti.
24130	5	“The attempt to attack Ukrainian nationalists the Crimean Bridge will be a devastating blow,” the parliamentary said.
24130	7	According to Sheremet, if such a provocation is attempted, the Ukrainian decision-making centers and logistics nodes will be hit.
24130	9	Andrei Klishas, a member of the Federation Council, said that such intentions of Kiev once again show the need for denification and demilitarization of the entire territory of Ukraine.
24130	11	Earlier, the counselor of the head of the office of Vladimir Zelensky Aleksei Arestovich told that the plans of the Armed Forces mean an attack on the Crimean Bridge. He explained that Ukrainian soldiers will attack him at the first appearance of such technical possibility.
24135	1	The King's Walk to Victory
24135	3	Today is the most sad night in Russian history: the night of the murder of the royal family. Sad but solemn: contrary to the expectations of the murderers, it became the Night of Victory of the Holy Royal Passioners over the forces of evil.
24135	5	This event was dedicated to the Forum “Orthodoxy and Peace in the 21st Century” at which he spoke with the lecture “Imperium. The image of the future.” The Emperor's Crosswalk begins soon from the Ekaterinburg Temple on the Blood, built on the place of the Emperor's murder, to the Ganina Yama, where the bodies of the martyrs were destroyed.
24135	7	Every time I participate in this crossroads, I experience a wonderful sense of spiritual and national unity. But today it is special: many thousands of Russian Orthodox people who arrived in Yekaterinburg for the Tsar Days, right now pray together to the Royal Passioners for the Russian Victory stolen from us in 1917, when the Russian Empire was already preparing for the Bosphorus Operation and the liberation of Constantinople – Tsarograd.
24135	9	Today, in the Donbass and Ukraine, our noble warriors return Russia to its historic path. Certainly, their victories are accomplished by the Heavenly Deputy of the Holy Lord of Passion, invisibly present, as the Lord of the Land of Russia, on the fields of battle.
24135	11	Happy Night of Victory, Orthodox! Holy Kingdom Passionists, pray to God for us!
24138	1	Latvia supports NATO expansion to the north
24138	3	Who could think just six years ago that the Latvian parliament would unanimously vote for the ratification of the protocols on Finland and Sweden’s accession to the North Atlantic Treaty.
24138	5	The events, which began on 24 February, launched the process of rejecting military neutrality of the two EU states, occupying the 6th and 4th place according to the size of the territory.
24138	7	“Given Russia’s launched war on Ukraine, the aggressive rhetoric of Russia and the violent methods of foreign policy, the chairman of the summit’s Foreign Affairs committee, Richard Colls, said, the risks of conflicts and the escalation of instability in the Baltic Sea region have increased significantly.”
24138	9	The agreement on the political decision of Helsinki and Stockholm will thus “reducte the window of Russia’s possibilities.” Cols noted that since the beginning of the 1990s, both countries “at some extent gradually approached NATO”, “participated in many NATO operations.”
24138	11	“Finnish and Swedish membership in the NATO will win all of us – as the alliance itself, taking two mature democracies in the participating states for democratic and legal values, and specifically the Baltic Sea region. The security policy and military capabilities of Sweden and Finland, as well as the pursuit of rapid further development of the issues do not cause. And we can be sure that the collective security guarantees provided for in Article 5 will be significantly strengthened.
24138	13	The head of the Latvian delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Baltic Sea, Janis Wucans, noted that in the context of Finland’s accession to NATO, the status of its own Islands, an autonomous region, which for a century was not only a neutral but also a demilitarized territory, will also be changed. The question is also about the settlement of the forces of the North Atlantic Alliance on the Swedish island of Gotland. In any case, a representative of the opposition CCC called for to vote “only for”.
24138	15	It is worth noting that in the debates on Sweden and Finland’s entry into the NATO was also mentioned the issue of the Arctic, which, according to deputy Cols, “elected alternative regimes as a goal to spread its imperialist ambitions as Russia, but also economic ambitions as, supposedly, China.”
24138	17	"After the NATO expansion to the north, the supply chains of troops and weapons through the North Atlantic will become safer. ""We are all well known that in Russia its tactical nuclear weapons... on submarines are mainly based near the Polar Circle."""
2414	1	"The West received the ""Fas"" team: Lavrov ""smalled the mask"" and claimed"
2414	3	The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, made a statement about the infringement of all the Russian. Now not only Ukraine is being used for this, the minister said.
2414	5	"The masks are broken. We all see. Now not Ukraine is used to offend all the Russian. The whole West received the ""fas"" team, - said the head of the foreign ministry, answering the questions of journalists."
2414	7	"According to the minister, today we have a deal with the situation when ""you are attacked simply because you have a Russian passport and went to the store, and you were accepted as a Russian."" And that’s what the “illuminated West” does."
2414	9	The current rusophobia in the Western countries can be considered a condemnation of the Western civilization, Lavrov noted.
2414	11	He also said that Russia will demand Ukraine to abolish the laws against Russian-speaking.
2414	13	Earlier, Sergey Lavrov said negotiations with Ukraine are going hard. The latter “rejected from its own proposals.”
2414	15	"""The Ukrainian side, although it seems to have expressed its understanding of the things that should be agreed during negotiations, is constantly changing its position,"" the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said."
2414	17	The West intends to keep our country in a state of combat for as long as possible, Lavrov added.
2414	19	“They look forward to continuing to pack Ukraine with weapons,” the minister said.
2414	21	On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed citizens, where he the conduct of a special military operation in the Donbass.
24140	1	Trump declares US constant humiliation on the world arena
24140	3	The United States stands on its knees and suffer on the world arena one historic humiliation after another. This was stated by former U.S. President Donald Trump in a speech at the America First Policy Institute in Washington.
24140	5	He explained that with him, Washington was the leader in energy resources, and the price of gasoline and inflation was low and the United States was respected. Now, he said, the U.S. is asking other countries for energy resources, inflation and fuel prices are record high, and millions of migrants are penetrating the country due to unstained borders.
24140	7	“The country is moving very quickly into hell,” Trump said.
24140	9	Previously, Trump accused the current head of state, Joe Biden, of turning the United States into a “dirty country.” He recalled that “America worships its knees only before God, and no one else.”
24140	11	On July 15, Trump announced that he decided to participate in the 2024 presidential election. The politician said he is still thinking about when to announce it — before or after the autumn interim elections to Congress, but expressed confidence in victory in case of participation in the election race.
24141	1	Volodine accuses the US of the coronavirus pandemic
24141	3	The coronavirus spread from biological laboratories in the United States, and America became the guilty of the pandemic. This was stated by the spokesman of the State Duma Вячеслав Володин in his Telegram channel.
24141	5	The politician spoke with the accusations of the United States in response to the statement of the American scientist and COVID-19 commission chief Jeffrey Sax, who said that the coronavirus was most likely created in the American laboratory.
24141	7	“Millions of sick and dead, the global economic crisis, the decrease in the level of life of people – the consequences of COVID-19, for which Washington needs to be held responsible,” he said.
24141	9	In response to the accusations, President Joe Biden is silent. This is explained, as Volodine claims, by the fear of the American leader to call the real guilty of the pandemic.
24141	11	The politician pointed out the need to dissecrete the U.S. military biological development and stop it. He called on the United States to be responsible for the spread of COVID-19, and also stated the need to compensate the country’s losses.
24141	13	Volodin had already allowed the COVID-19 to escape from the U.S. laboratory. He then suggested that the United States continues parallelly to work on the modeling of the virus, and, if it is not stopped, the world will be “the hostage of new and new situations.”
24154	1	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says cooperation between Russia and the West in the future is inevitable.
24154	3	The West after the completion of the special military operation will have to live and cooperate with Russia, the conditions for this are put now, said at the meeting of the UN Security Council on Ukraine the first deputy permanent representative of the Russian Federation at the world organization Dmitry Polanski.
24154	5	By delivering to Ukraine long-battle artillery systems and the RSZO, you, in essence, move the necessary for the peaceful development of the aforementioned areas the conditional security line further to the west, thus clarificing the goals and tasks of our special military operation. Think about this, as well as about the fact that after it ends, you will still have to live next to us and cooperate. The conditions for this stage you are asking yourself in a lot now,” TASS Polanski quotes.
24154	7	He also pointed out that the willingness of the West to help the Ukrainians kill Donetsk and Luhansk children will hardly be forgotten, both by the Ukrainian and Russian people.
24154	9	Earlier, the press spokesman of the President Dmitry Peskov said that the Russian side does not fix changes in the positions of the West and its willingness to withdraw from the Ukrainian crisis.
24154	11	The New York Post readers evaluated the statement of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, calling on China “to remain neutral” and not to help Russia.
24154	13	“I hope to see the day when this corrupt NATO marionette of Zelensky will be captured, shattered (more no fake socks in the style of the militants), shattered in the chain, and then dispatched and sent to the east of Ukraine, where he will appear before the present court for his war crimes,” Freddie wrote.
24154	15	“He said this before or after a photo session for the Vogue magazine?” – said the user at777.
24154	17	“If America can help Ukraine, why China can’t help Russia?” asked Oksure.
24154	19	“Oh, so now you want to tell China what it should do? You’re a laugh,” wrote Ralph Holloway.
24154	21	Earlier, U.S. media wrote that Zelensky should not neglect U.S. internal problems, while demanding further support from Washington.
24156	1	Chilean bishops oppose the draft constitution due to abortion and euthanasia
24156	3	The Catholic bishops of Chile have declared their categorical dishonesty to the Chilean Constitution, which legalizes euthanasia and abortion. This was by the Catholic portal Crux on July 23.
24156	5	“We negatively evaluate the norms that allow abortion, leave an open opportunity for euthanasia, generate family understanding, restrict the freedom of parents in raising children, as well as those that impose some restrictions on the right to education and freedom of religion,” the bishops said in a statement.
24156	7	“We consider especially serious the introduction of abortion, which in the proposed text of the constitution is called ‘the right to voluntary abortion,’ the priests emphasize.
24156	9	Their statement also states that the rule that opens the doors for abortions, not only excludes the father’s participation in this decision, but also gives the right of personal and institutional refusal of military service for reasons of conscience.
24156	11	As for the right to help in suicide and euthanasia, the bishops believe that “this is a two-minded right, because it is aimed at solving the problem by deliberately terminating human life. This is its dehumanizing character because it encourages “one-time culture” and can make the lives of people already weakened by the disease even more fragile.”
24156	13	They also accused of distorting the concept of family the article of the Constitution, which recognizes “families in their various forms, manifestations and ways of life, without limiting them exclusively to sons and blood-born bonds.”
24156	15	“The public debates of the last weeks show us that the proposed text has not caused broad and universal recognition,” the bishops wrote in their statement. “Then we face a choice between two highly polarized positions, and this makes the decision of each citizen difficult.”
24156	17	On July 4, after the annual process of development, the new edition of the Constitution was presented to the president of the country, Gabriel Boric. In October 2020, 78% of Chile’s voters supported the creation of a new Constitution as part of the refusal to the legacy of the 17-year rule of the dictator General Augusto Pinocci.
24156	19	The rewrite of the constitution was approved by the government after the 2019 mass protests led the country to the fool, and although Boric was not yet in power at that time, he invested much of his political capital in the project.
24156	21	The new constitution will be one of the longest in the world. Compared to the document of the Pinocchio era, it is wider and consolidates a number of innovations, including freedom of speech, abortion, the right to clean air and water, as well as the state national health service.
24156	23	However, the first reaction to the document was negative, including because it would lead to the exclusion of the Senate from the current two-chamber Congress of the country.
24157	1	Patriarch Cyril compares abortion to death penalty
24157	3	The representative of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch of Moscow and the whole of Russia Cyril during his speech at the opening of the 21st International Educational Reading touched the problem of abortions, comparing them to the death penalty that is prohibited in Russia. “The society is put into the hole of legal contradictions.
24157	5	“The society is put into the hole of legal contradictions. If we refuse the death penalty, recognizing the integrity of life, then why are abortion and euthanasia considered acceptable? In fact, there and there the human life is destroyed,” the Holy said.
24157	7	In addition, the RPC said it is unacceptable to create state and public structures that under the pretext of protection of children interfere in family affairs.
24157	9	“The unfounded choice of children is a feature that cannot be overcome. This is a red line,” the Patriarch emphasized.
24158	1	US reputation in the EU collapsed after the tragedy in Texas and the abortion decision
24158	3	Massive armed attacks and the cancellation of the Supreme Court's abortion ruling undermined the US reputation in European countries, a public opinion survey on July 27 reports Axios.
24158	5	According to the data obtained within the framework of the Morning Consult survey, the reputation of the U.S. in the countries of Europe after the start of the Russian special operation on denification of Ukraine has significantly strengthened. Over the course of two weeks after the start of the operation, the average U.S. respondents increased by 9% and this figure reached a 25% score by the end of May.
24158	7	However, the “Honeymoon” was short-term, the company’s experts note, and after the shooting of small children in the school of the Texas city of Yuvalda, as well as after the abolition of the Supreme Court’s decision on abortions, the number of those who relate to the U.S. beneficially has decreased, and to this day flows around the score of 13-15%.
24158	9	The company’s experts pay attention to the fact that the image of the country abroad can affect a wide range of issues: from its foreign policy efficiency to its economic influence.
24158	11	“The study of how the country’s position on this market can affect its exports to this market shows that the consequences can be huge: one study showed that the rise to one position in the world ranking of countries according to their product reputation is associated with 2% increase in exports, and that the reputation of the country’s population can also affect exports,” they said.
24158	13	"""The analogue situation with tourism is another industry that is strongly dependent on foreign demand: a number of studies have shown a close connection between the image of the country abroad and the desire of tourists to visit it,"" Morning Consult added."
24160	1	Abortion supporters in the U.S. vote less than opponents
24160	3	Opponents to the abolition of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on abortion are less likely to go to elections than those who support or are indifferent to this step, according to a public opinion survey on July 29 The Hill.
24160	5	"According to the public opinion survey, the results of which were published on July 29, they believe that the cancellation of the Supreme Court's ruling in the case ""Rou vs. Wade"" became a ""significant loss for women's rights"" 65% of respondents. 35% do not agree with it. However, only 52% of those who opposed the revocation of the Supreme Court's ruling in the case ""Rou vs. Wade"" intend to go to the interim elections that will be held in November of this year, while from those who are indifferent to this event, 70% are ready to go to the elections."
24160	7	Only a third of women under the age of 40 say with confidence that they will vote, despite the fact that they belong to the demographic groups, the most concerned access to abortions.
24160	9	Such indicators are a blow to Democrats who consider abortions the most important electoral topic and a way to activate the base of their supporters in the difficult year of elections. Candidates from the Democratic Party at all levels and the groups that represent them have in recent months violently criticized their opponents for their posture on abortions.
24162	1	"Russian Embassy in the U.S. commented on reports of ""attacks"" on the ZEA"
24162	2	Russia's Embassy in the U.S. calls for the cessation of Russian-phobic inventions about the attacks on the ZEA
24162	4	"Washington, 8 August – RIA Novosti. The Russian Embassy in the U.S. after reports from the U.S. media accusing Russian forces of ""attacks"" on the Zaporozhsk nuclear power station, called on U.S. journalists to stop repeating ""rusophobic fiction."""
24162	5	"“We call on the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency to condemn the criminal actions of Kiev and to take urgent measures to prevent provocations on radially dangerous objects in Ukraine. And American journalists - to stop throwing the Rusophobic fiction,"" - said in the disseminated commentary of the diplomacy."
24162	7	The U.S. media has launched a massive dezinformation campaign, the embassy stressed. Attacks from the USSR create a real threat to the nuclear security of Europe, the commentary says.
24162	9	"Earlier, the authorities of Energodar said that the Ukrainian troops on Sunday night attacked from the RSZO ""Uragan"" on the Zaporozhskaya nuclear power plant, scales and rocket engine fell about 400 meters from the current energy block of the station. Attacks on the Zaporozha nuclear power plant, in case of damage to the energy block, threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, foreign Europe, as well as Asia, the city administration stressed."
24162	10	The USSR has been under the control of the Russian military since March. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated the justifiability of taking the power plant under protection in terms of preventing the leaks of nuclear and radioactive materials. The ministry also reminded that the station continues to be managed by an Ukrainian operator.
24166	1	New victims on the global “green” altar – cows and Ukrainians
24166	3	Reading the world news of the last months, you’re sometimes surprised by how you can combine completely incompatible stories on one newspaper or in one television news edition. For example, one of the main problems of the current global crisis at all levels is recognized by global hunger, which, according to the UN estimates, already affects up to ten percent of the world’s population and continues to spread. And here the television chief of some news channel reads these data, shows the hungry children of Africa or Asia, after which, without a look at conscience, he is gladly informing about the government’s decision in the framework of the green policy to sharply reduce livestock. And no one has the idea of linking these two stories together. Why? In the world’s hunger, it is always possible to blame Russia for what the politicians and propagandaists of the West have been actively engaged recently.
24166	4	They, indeed, have recently emerged a serious headache in the form of Sri Lanka, where the unthinkable green reform has led to the food crisis, rebellions and the collapse of power. The same efforts are now being made by the Western media, the eco-activists and the various Soros “anti-fea” structures to convince the world community that the events in Sri Lanka are in no way related to the island government’s decisions to ban inorganic fertilizers, which has resulted in a record non-production and food deficit. No, of course, Russia is guilty of what U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken directly said. Well, that is the same Putin has sharply reduced the harvest of tea and rice in Sri Lanka.
24166	6	Or take another example. For several months, the Netherlands has been shocked by the protests of farmers who are angry with the government’s plans to significantly reduce the population of livestock and birds in the country. Overall, Hawaii requires farm owners to reduce this rate by one-third within a fairly short period of time. It will be difficult for the cow owners – there the planned decrease sometimes reaches 95 percent, which will inevitably lead to the destruction and closure of the business.
24166	8	The Netherlands is one of the world’s leading meat producers, the world’s fourth supplier of dairy products and the second after the United States food exporter. With a relatively small territory, this country is the seventh largest in the European Union.
24166	9	And that’s what interesting. Almost all the world’s media in a way or in a way illuminate the protests of the Dutch farmers and their decision by the government Mark Rutte. But has anyone, in general, calculated how such a sharp blow to the Netherlands’ farming economy will impact the world food market? Has anyone linked this solution to the global hunger problem? Yes, you can always go back to Russia. It will even be interesting to hear the future explanations of Western propagandists about how Moscow has influenced the decision of Hague to reduce the number of Dutch beasts.
24166	10	"And now the world’s green people are just out of enthusiasm in connection with the fresh decision of the government of New Zealand to impose a special tax on... more culturally, the emissions of methane with cows. The authorities explain their ruling as follows: ""More than half of New Zealand's methane production belongs to agriculture, and methane contributes greatly to global warming and air pollution."""
24166	12	Critics of this decision directly warn that it will destroy New Zealand farms. The Australian edition of The Spectator points out: “In this case, the agricultural industry must be sacrificed on the altar of climate change – to the extent to which it can be judged, without any scientific reason, considering that our collective emissions are too small to change something.”
24166	13	And on the footsteps of New Zealand, Australia intends to go, and other countries may follow. Environmental activists are already calling for a double reduction in the population of the New Zealand livestock. They say, “Intense dairy industry is a false economy. While the benefits come to a small number of people in the industry, paying is to everyone. The expenditure often lies on those who are least guilty of climate change, and on those who are most vulnerable.” On whom lies the burden of travel or the deficit of meat products after the disappearance of cows, the green activists are not concerned at all. As they do not worry about the global hunger issues that will necessarily worsen as the population of livestock is reduced in countries that are the world’s leading food suppliers. And none of the Greens offers any other alternative. Reduce, destroy, “to reason to destroy” – and so on? We will see what it will get out of it.
24166	14	"And here are only the brightest examples of the phenomenon, which in the conservative circles has already been called ""ecotyration"". But these problems are faced by farmers of almost all Western countries and (as we see, for example, the same Sri Lanka) a number of not the richest countries of the third world. The mainstream press in this regard is more concerned by the fact that in the protests of farmers against ecotyration political dividends acquire right-radical political forces. It seems that this is the main, not the only problem of the West. What about world hunger? No, they did not hear anything. But it’s not about Russia, of course."
24166	15	However, the untouchable eco-activists of George Soros have emerged a new interest – Ukraine. Currently, the pro-Western regime of Kiev actively proposes to use the territory of the country under its control as a polygon to test new types of weapons. It doesn’t matter how many Ukrainians will be killed. And the people of Soros are now, without waiting for the end of the fighting, calling for Ukraine to be a polygon to expand the global green experiment described above.
24166	17	"The plans were shared on the Financial Times pages by the senior employee of the Soros Open Society Foundation Hizer Grabbe. She urges to take advantage of the unique opportunity and “to create the first really low-carbon economy in Europe.” Judging by her explanation, under this chance it implies a total destruction of the Ukrainian economy. Here is the example that Grabbé writes: ""A good example is steel. The largest source of pollution in Ukraine, the Mariupol metallurgical combination, is in ruins. If considering the destruction of the Azovstal plant, which the militants of the Nazi units tried to make their fortress, a ""good example"", then this really tells a lot about the plans of global ecotyration with respect to Ukraine."
24166	18	"The Soros activist calls for the use of frozen Russian finances abroad for ""assurance of political risks"" (accept, a good replacement of the not very curtuous term ""theft"" was invented in the Open Society) and over time to turn Ukraine into the raw supply of ""decarbonized Europe"". For this, the European Union, according to Grabbe, should support the small farms of Ukraine with the condition that they will produce organic products. So I want to add: like in Sri Lanka. But such a comparison in the green environment after known events was not accepted."
24166	19	"That is, the global green experiment suggests to expand to Ukraine, pre-destroying it to the foundation (you see what a ""good example"" is the destruction of air polluting industrial giants). How can we not ask the question: did not the Soros structures invest a lot of funds in the burning of the Ukrainian crisis, and accordingly, in the destruction of the Ukrainian state as such? After all, on the ruins it is much easier to build polygons and put experiments over the experienced population. What happens to him is secondary. After all, if the new foolish idea proves its insolvency, as it has been so far, it is always possible to write everything on Russia again. Not to the West. Not even for Soros."
24169	1	"Kiev calls for Amnesty International to check for ""benefits"" from Russia"
24169	2	Ukraine calls for investigation whether Amnesty International receives benefits from Russia
24169	4	"In Kiev, they asked to investigate whether the human rights organization Amnesty International does not receive ""benefits"" from Russia. The corresponding request for the check was made by the assistant head of the office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podoljak, TASS reports."
24169	6	He believes that in his latest report, human rights defenders discredited the “concept of international humanitarian organizations” which, he says, will have harmful consequences.
24169	8	Amnesty International published a report on the crimes committed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the report, Kiev is causing damage to the civilian population by using weapons systems in settlements, including schools and hospitals. Thus, not only the military law is violated, but also the international humanitarian law.
24169	10	The report annoyed the Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky. He said that the human rights organization “provides to amnesty the terrorist state and transfer the guilt from the aggressor to the victim.”
24171	1	Professor from Latvia told why Latvians don’t understand the Russians and Ukrainians
24171	3	“There are still things among these neighboring peoples that we can’t understand to the end,” says Henry Soms, a professor of history at the University of Douglas at Latvijas Avīze.
24171	5	He draws attention to the changes in his homeland: “In peaceful conditions in Latvia there were many people who didn’t like the Latvian language, who believed that all resources took Riga, that the state had a wrong policy, such an amorphic electorate that supported the policy of Russia.
24171	7	As a result of the war in Ukraine, the number of these people has decreased. For now it’s hard to say so simply: “I’m for Russia!” Now it’s intellectually necessary to figure out why the Russian power and the state like if they attack Ukraine, and why it’s welcomed.
24171	9	The majority of the Russians were silent, others about the war in Ukraine say: “Latvians, don’t go between the Russians and the Ukrainians, you don’t understand anything!”There were Daugavpils Russians who said so in March, when the Daugavpils Music High School lifted the flag of Ukraine and the gvalt began. He had to listen and think about it.
24171	11	Despite political differences, the Russians and the Ukrainians have more similar mentality, behavior, stereotypes than the Baltics. It is a neighborhood and brotherhood.”
24176	1	Hungarian parliament calls the EU policy of anti-Russia sanctions wrong
24176	3	The policy of anti-Russia sanctions of the European Union is almost wrong, overcoming the crisis will only help mutual respect, Hungarian parliament spokesman Laslo Kaver said.
24176	5	"The world can learn a lot from us too. For example, the EU leaders in Brussels – if they ever give us their genuine interest – can know the truth of the Turkish proverb: “If you don’t sit on a horse, don’t stretch your leg.” This is a useful knowledge, because the EU leaders... with their misguided sanctions policy, for example, wiped their legs without a horse under themselves... The sad result of this will be that the EU leaders in Brussels will dissolve the entire European economy together with themselves,"" Kever said, speaking to the guests of the Kurultai Gunn and Turk Traditions Festival, reports RIA News."
24176	7	He said that the crisis and challenges will only be overcome if both in the West and in the East all the people who don’t want to wipe or falsify the past, but want to learn from it; those who don’t want to devote the present and the future, but want to share it with others, respecting each other’s faith, culture, homeland, national state and human dignity.
24176	9	Previously, French media reminded about how French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on March 1 that the anti-Russia sanctions “to horror” are effective.
24176	11	The Western media recognized the energy victory of Russia. The newspaper Wiener Zeitung wrote that Germany and Austria have a high level of support for President Vladimir Putin and Russia. The majority of Europeans are opposed to the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions.
24183	1	Google Maps administrators asked Russia to clarify how Europe’s borders will change in the coming years
24183	3	The developers of the Google maps service have sent an official request to the Russian leadership with a request to clarify Moscow’s forecasts on the possible revision of the borders of European countries in the next 10 years.
24183	5	“We know that in Russia there are a lot of talented analysts, whose models of the future are almost always accomplished. Since 2005, the map of Europe has changed repeatedly, we would be very grateful to Russia if it shared its forecasts about the prospects of the change of borders by 2032,” Google maps chief Lars Rasmussen said.
24183	7	According to the source of our edition in the government, Russia will be ready to provide interested information to Google only on mutual basis. It is about a few tens of millions of dollars, paying which the U.S. company will be able to get a potential map of Europe by 2030.
24185	1	Zelensky proposes Boris Johnson the position of Governor of Odessa
24185	3	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him about the work proposed by Vladimir Zelensky during their meeting in Kiev. After the end of his office as head of the British government, Johnson can take the position of governor of the Odessa region.
24185	5	According to Zelensky, the post of head of the Odessa administration was repeatedly and successfully occupied by foreigners – starting with Duke de Rishelye and ending with former President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili. Social surveys show that Johnson in Odessa has a rating of 11% - higher than any other candidate for governors in the past 20 years. Boris Johnson told social media that he has not yet accepted the proposal because he is not sure that it will be approved by the head of the Southwest Federal District.
24185	7	“This was a very generous proposal from the head of the Ukrainian state. Odessa is a beautiful city, the best in the Baltic Sea. I know him very well and I love him. I am glad to be his governor, but I am not sure that the proposal will remain in force until the end of my powers. But if so, I’ll call Putin, I’ll say, “I have an official paper, you can’t simply refuse me.” If he rejects, we will again accuse him of war crimes and poison “Novichk” some of the outlet agents,” Boris Johnson said.
24186	1	“That’s little for anyone to understand”: a Moscow designer who moved to Georgia collects money to translate Tbilisi’s street indicators into Russian
24186	3	Moscow urbanist Daniel Kurdjukov, who made a railroad to Georgia in March, proposed to translate the road indicators to Tbilisi into the Russian language and even opened a collection of money for this destination. According to the designer, the Georgian language is uncomprehensible for migrants from Russia, so instead it should be used Russian or English.
24186	5	The Kurdish plan to raise about $2,000. For this money, he will create the design of new street indicators and then transfer it to the city authorities.
24186	7	“Let’s be honest, these screws are little to understand – even if you translate them with a Google camera, it’s not possible to remember, they’re just fusion in the eyes. In the center there are indicators in English, but in the center living is expensive, many settle on the outskirts. Therefore, we need to make new indicators and make them humanly – in Russian or English,” he wrote on Facebook.
24186	9	"“I’m planning to launch a survey among those who made a rocket – we’ll decide whether English or anyway Russian. The second, unwanted, Russian language now has a clear abuse tint throughout the world. But as people decide, it will be,"" the designer added, responding to the comments."
24189	1	Zelensky invited Saudi prince to swine rice in a new beer restaurant in the center of Kiev
24189	3	The office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky invited Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to visit the new beer restaurant “95 Quarter”, which opened in the center of Kiev. According to the president, the crown prince will no longer be able to try such a pig rubber as there.
24189	5	"The restaurant was opened by the business partners of Zelensky on the studio ""95 quarters"", the president's office. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader himself is not the owner of the institution: the shares in it belong to his cousin and his three-year-old grandson. In the menu are presented more than 30 varieties of German beer, pig rice, Ukrainian borst, varenics, palanica and other dishes of the national cuisine. In addition to entertainment and entertainment, Zelensky intends to discuss with Prince Mohammed the possibility of lowering oil prices."
24189	7	“You have such a delicious salad in the south and you don’t make such a pine beer, you just have to try it. I hope that after your visit, Saudi Arabia will review its attitude to the current conflict and will a stabilization of oil prices at $14 per barrel,” he said.
2423	1	There are certain parallels in the behavior of Putin and Hitler. 
2423	3	The temporary U.S. affairs officer in Ukraine, Christina Quinn, has stated the parallels between the President of the Russian Federation and the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Both began a bloody war, killing people without understanding and ignoring the peoples.
2423	5	"This was by Queen in an interview with the RBC-Ukraine. According to Quinn, both Hitler and Putin - both started ""a war on choice."" The temporary trust in U.S. affairs in Ukraine noted that our country has not provoked aggression by the Russian Federation, which the country is constantly promoting among its population."
2423	7	"“I would say there are certain parallels in President Putin’s behavior. He started a war that was completely a ""war by choice"". Ukraine has done nothing to provoke the aggression that Russia is now imposing on Ukraine. He kills people without understanding as Adolf Hitler did. He does not think of his people when he does it. He does not think of the people of Ukraine. I’m not going to perform parallels, but, say so, I see some of them,” Quinn said."
2433	1	Western weapons are dangerous not for Russia, but for Ukraine
2433	2	Politologist Markelov says the help of the West is harmful to Ukraine
2433	4	"The Russian military continues successful actions on denification of Ukraine. Political adviser Sergey Markelov specially for ""360"" told why the Russian army is fighting on factories and warehouses, as well as what the help of the West is for Ukraine."
2433	5	Russian political scientist and political scientist Sergey Markelov
2433	7	Next is direct speech.
2433	8	Technical in Ukraine
2433	10	In the Kharkiv region, on the outskirts of Lozova, the Russian troops destroyed with missiles of a large distance of the body of the cushion-mechanical factory. There was the restoration and repair of the armor.
2433	12	According to the data of 2021, there were almost 450 enterprises in Ukraine where they could serve and repair military equipment. Ukraine at the time of the USSR occupied 17% of the military-defense complex. Although most of it is no longer left, today we see enough industrial zones that can carry out production as well as current, operational and strategic repairs of military equipment.
2433	14	In the average, the Russian troops have already “abandoned” about 50% of such enterprises. Such point-out of such industrial zones, where military equipment can be stored, rebuilt, repaid and simply hidden, is an obligatory element of our actions.
2433	16	For Ukraine, this is a problem of defence and the availability of military equipment. It, on the one hand, is disastrously rapidly destroyed, on the other hand, if it is damaged, it is no longer suitable for repair. Therefore, the Ukrainian side is screaming in all the throat that they very much need a new equipment for food.
2433	17	About Aviation
2433	19	The Russian air defense shot down the Ukrainian MiG-29 in the area of Slavyansk, destroyed 13 Ukrainian BPLs in the Donbass, Kharkiv and Zaporozh region. These air losses are very sensitive to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
2433	21	Military insiders give approximately the following statistics: in the first month of special military operation, 5-6% of aircraft and all drones were left on a daily basis. In the second month a little less - they came out by 2-3% a day. Today, to the hundred days, there is somewhere in the area of 0.5%-1% destruction of air military equipment per day.
2433	23	Statistics – both ours and not ours – have long shown that there is no air and weapons that can lead military actions from the air. And it collects from Europe on a thread, using gray, white, black equipment supply schemes.
2433	24	The aid of the West and its consequences
2433	26	Of course, Ukraine is very waiting for the promised US military multi-purpose fighter F16, which was promised to put in late June or in the middle of July. However, according to experts, the aircraft will be able to arrive a maximum of three to four months. After all, removing 100 military aircraft across half the world is a serious logistical operation.
2433	28	Strategically and tactically, the Russian armed forces have created a balance in which it is unlikely that something will stop us. I think, from the point of view of political and military expertise, we already understand how technology appears in the battle places. And, accordingly, we can start battling them from the moment of entering the territory of Ukraine.
2433	30	All the infiltrations that the West makes in the form of a variety of support for the troops of Ukraine do not complicate our work. We are going tightly and achieving our goals, occupying the territories that our president has designated.
2433	32	All this foreign weapons simply increases the duration of the conflict, the number of victims and the destruction of Ukraine. Today, the West behaves as a political, ideological, diplomatic, military chemistry: they simultaneously call on to stop the conflict, sit at the table of negotiations, but at the same time sign documents on a further portion of deadly weapons for shipping to Ukraine.
2437	1	The US is trying to stop not only Russia, but also the EU. 
2437	3	The US forced the EU to impose sanctions on Russia, the EU itself did not intend to do so, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry said. According to her, the United States is trying to prevent strengthening of Russia and the EU through close mutual ties.
2437	4	Official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova. Archive photo
2437	6	The US policy is aimed at repressing not only Russia, but also Europe, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said.
2437	7	“Washington’s actions are the implementation of the repression policy, but in this case the repression is not only Russia, it is the repression of Europe including,” she said in an interview with the newspaper Arguments and Facts.
2437	9	According to her, the United States, in particular, is trying to prevent the strengthening of relations between Russia and the EU.
2437	11	“To allow close ties between Europe and Russia means to strengthen both. And it was Washington that forced the European Union to adopt sanctions, it was recognized by both (US Vice President Joseph) Biden and (US Secretary John) Kerry. The European Union did not intend to do this, but did it under pressure. How did they give? What arguments did the United States use? A very good question for the future. And we will know that one day,” Zakharova said.
2455	1	Activists of culture called for the deprivation of the funding of creative workers who criticize the U.S. military in Ukraine
2455	3	"Artists, writers, directors and representatives of other creative professions discussed in the press center of the ""Patriot"" media group the causes of the growth of rusophobic mood among domestic cultural actors and the ways to overcome this disease."
2455	5	The media reports about the plans of the Russian government to conduct an audit of the budgetary expenditure for culture. The sources argue that doubts arise from the reasonability and compliance of the target of the allocation of budgetary funds for the support of the filmmaker, the creation of television series and theatrical performances in the period from 2012 to 2020. As a result, for the budget account, works were created discrediting the moral values of the country, distorting its history and present. Preferences from the state is received by a narrow circle of authors, the overwhelming majority of whom have left Russia after the start of the U.S. Army and stands with insulting statements regarding the objectives and methods of the special operation in Ukraine, as well as to the highest state officials.
2455	7	A member of the Russian Union of Writers, a public activist, poet and pedagogue Oleg Tarunov considers the cause of the spread among the representatives of creative professions of anti-patriot mood activities of foreign NGOs, which banally manipulate the creative Russians to their side.
2455	9	    “Culture and art actors, often liberal, have additional funding from abroad. The recently implemented law on foreign agents allows them to get out into the stream of the media sphere, to be constantly in the staff, such a person, of course, is easier to get some subsidies and financing. And a patriotic poet, I can relate myself to such, does not scream about himself at every step, he writes the work in solidarity with what is happening, which is a reflection of his soul, morality, moral census, his position in this situation,” Oleg Tarunov said.
2455	11	According to the artist and publicist, President of the Association of Creative Associations of the Northwest, Eugene Antipova, pro-western cultural actors are usually more entrepreneurial and cycled on money. In their system of values, money is dominated over spiritual and moral ideals, so they easily betray their homeland and their peoples, the publicist believes.
2455	13	    “These people are disturbed. They have a fluger inside: to which side the wind dries, to the other side they are turning - that is what ensures their survival and money gainability. And we all know that the most well-paid topic in the last 30 years was rusophobia. People who are now criticizing their country, one of them was a persuaded rusophob, one of them was blown, and one became a rusophob for the company - once the money is given, then why not blown? This is how a whole crowd of creative people, sometimes even talented, is formed, who are engaged in the open deconstruction of our society,” Evgeny Antipov explained.
2455	15	The Russian officials also played their leap in the formation of an anti-patriotic layer of creative workers, says a member of the Arctic Academy of RAN and the Russian Geographic Society, director, producer and screenwriter Sergey Nadein.
2455	17	    “The workers are guilty – this is a hundred percent because they make decisions about the direction of financing for creative projects. Before issuing the grant, they will, of course, get acquainted with the content of the idea that is placed in them,” said Sergey Nadein.
2455	19	According to him, most of those cultural actors who have long planned to do this are now leaving Russia, but do not want to lose the source of their well-being.
2455	21	    “They’ve been ready to leave for a long time, they’ve never loved our country, our people, now they’ve got a very ‘comfortable’ case,” he says.
2455	23	Experts support the intention of the governments to review the policy of providing budgetary funding for the implementation of creative projects in the direction of encouraging their patriotic orientation. At the same time, it is not excluded that in the existing conditions of confrontation with the West in the Russian Federation must be introduced some form of censorship on the content of artworks.
2455	25	    “In this case, I think some censorship is appropriate. “When such terrible events happen like now, how can we stand against our country?” said writer and publisher Victoria Sherwood. 
2455	27	Yevgeny Antipov believes that such censorship should at least be internal to creative workers.
2455	29	    “The thing is that culture is a system of limitations, it is self-censorship, the censorship of the brought history, mental,” the artist explained.
2455	31	Oleg Tarunov considers the creative workers who loudly declare their unhappiness to the actions of Russia to force Ukraine to peace to be openly traitors.
2455	33	    Accepting or not accepting such cultural actors is a matter of everyone. But my opinion is that what they have done now is at least an indirect factor, which can be classified as the phrase “Change of the Country”. I think our simple people will not accept these people because they feel their real attitude to themselves, no matter how they try to mislead people,” the poet says. 
2455	35	According to him, the citizens of Russia in their majority report how difficult the problem is solved by our soldiers in Ukraine.
2455	37	    “We are fighting there with the Nazis who confess terrorist values. And, God, let our children stay alive, return home to their loved ones,” Oleg Tarunov said.
2456	1	"Unlimited Rusophobia: How the ""politics of abolition"" of all the Russians kills Western culture"
2456	3	Subject: Russian military special operation in Ukraine
2456	5	"Rusophobia in the West has reached unthinkable boundaries. It has suffered a culture that has always served as a support for international cooperation. In Europe, Dostoevsky, Tchaikovsky and ""Russian dancers"" Dega are abolished."
2456	7	The anti-Russian agenda of many Western countries is getting turnover every day. On the background of Russia’s special operations in Ukraine in Europe and America, the armies were not only against the political elite of Russia and the Russian economy, but also, what was not before, against the Russian culture.

2456	10	"The National Gallery in London has changed the name of Edgar Dega's widely known painting ""Russian dancers"" to ""Ukrainian dancers"", according to data on the museum's website. The decision was taken after the corresponding calls of the Ukrainians on social networks, reports RIA Novosti. "
2456	12	    “The name of this painting has been the subject of constant discussion for many years and has been highlighted in scientific literature, but during the last month it has been given increased attention due to the current situation, so we thought it was the right time to update the name of the painting to better reflect its topic,” a representative of the National Gallery said.
2456	14	The picture depicts dancers from Eastern Europe who visited France in the 90s of the 19th century and performed in Mullen Rouge and Casino de Paris. All the girls on the shirt dressed in long jewelry and white shirts. An important feature, according to users of the internet, is the flowers on their heads, all of them are depicted in national Ukrainian colors - yellow and blue.
2456	16	"The painting of the French impressionist of the beginning of the twentieth century is currently not exhibited in the gallery. The National Gallery also that due to the special military operation of Russia in Ukraine will not include the painting of Rafael ""The Holy Family"" from the collection of the State Hermitage in the exhibition ""Credit Suisse: Rafael"", the start of which is scheduled for April 9."

2456	21	"At the beginning of March, the Bavarian state opera broke the relationship with opera singer Anna Netrebko and director Valery Gergiev because they were ""not distant enough"" from the Russian special operation in Ukraine."
2456	23	    “Because of the terrible offensive war of Russia on Ukraine and the lack of sufficient distancing from Valeria Gergiev and Anna Netrebko, the Bavarian state opera cancells all existing relations,” the executive director of the opera Sergey Derni wrote.
2456	25	The Munich Philharmonic Orchestra has also ceased to cooperate with Gergiev. The decision was made by Munich mayor Dieter Reiter.
2456	27	"Munich is separating with Valery Gergiev. From this moment there will no longer be concerts of the IFO under his leadership,"" the head of the city ""Izvestia"" said. "

2456	48	On the Day of the Workers of Culture, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with a speech in which he addressed attention to the attack on Russian culture in the West, but expressed hope that through the culture that connects and unites us all, the truth will try the way.
2456	50	"“The famous ‘cultural abolition’ has become ‘cultural abolition’. From the concert offices are exhausted Chaykovsky, Shostakovich, Rahmaninov. Russian writers and their books are also banned. The last time such a mass campaign to destroy unpleasant literature almost 90 years ago was conducted by the Nazis in Germany. We know well and remember from the footage of the film chronicles how books are burned directly on the squares,"" the Russian newspaper said. "

2459	1	“The only thing Putin understands is the power. The weakness will be used.”
2459	2	"Former British Prime Minister Brown remembers how he was ""forced"" to look at Putin from down to up "
2459	4	Former head of the British government, Gordon Brown, said, “There’s never been illusions about what Putin was.” The politician shared memories of his visit to Moscow in 2006, when he was placed on a “very low chair.” Speaking of recent events, Brown criticized the global dissemination of sanctions against the Russian Federation. He claims that the Russian president is supposed to “react only to the uncompromising demonstration of force.” More detail in the “Gazety.ru” material.
2459	6	Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told The Telegraph the details of his visit to Moscow, which took place in 2006. In particular, he recalled how in the Kremlin he was then “forced to sit on a very low seat.”
2459	8	Brown also claims that Russian leader Vladimir Putin allegedly threatened him. “I didn’t have any illusions about what Putin was,” the former Prime Minister said.
2459	10	"According to him, the West for many years has never been able to oppose the President of the Russian Federation, until ""this invasion of Ukraine."" Brown also criticized global dissemination, pointing out that 150 countries have not imposed sanctions against Russia even after the start of a special military operation."
2459	12	“I looked at him from below up.”
2459	14	Remembering his visit to the Kremlin in 2006, when he was the Chancellor of Treasury (Gazeta.Ru), Brown said he was placed on a very low seat.
2459	16	“I looked at Putin from below upward. He is, of course, a relatively low man, and wears these high cables.
2459	18	On that day he pulled out these catalog cards and began to read all the information he had about me, as if he wanted to prove that he knew about me more than I knew about himself. “Therefore, when people say that Putin has changed and is threatening only now, I can tell you that he threatened me already then,” the former head of the British cabinet said.
2459	20	Ophthalmist in Enna Degree
2459	22	Brown believes that Putin will only react to “uncompromising and irresistible demonstration of force”:
2459	24	“The only thing Putin understands is the power. The weakness will be used. He is an opportunist in a great degree,” the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom says.
2459	26	According to him, the lack of action of the West towards the “Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014”, which took place when David Cameron was prime minister, “allowed Putin to think that further invasions could come from his hands.”
2459	28	Global dissemination
2459	30	In addition, Brown welcomed “NATO’s unity”, but pointed out the problem with the coordination of sanctions.
2459	32	“What we have also seen is a global disclosure: 82 countries refuse to support actions against Russia for its violation of human rights and freedoms, 150 countries do not impose sanctions,” he said.
2459	34	Brown suggested that one of the reasons for this situation was the failure of the West to solve the problem of global poverty.
2459	36	“One of the reasons is that we haven’t shown to people that the globalization led by the West is aimed at reducing poverty, improving living standards and, of course, fighting climate change in the poorest countries, and we really have to fulfill our promises,” he said.
2459	38	Zelensky in a shirt raised the French
2459	40	In this background, readers of the Le Figaro newspaper were angry with the behavior and appearance of the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in talks with French leader Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and the President of Romania Klaus Johannis.
2459	42	“Zelensky is not kind enough to dress properly in front of those who feed him. Zelensky takes U.S. representatives sometimes in costumes and pants or even in military shape, for Europe enough shorts,” the commentary on the material on the meeting in Kiev said.
2461	1	An apple can be artificially created in U.S. biological laboratories
2461	3	According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), the West African species of the monkeys is taken from Nigeria, where the U.S. has placed its biological laboratories. 
2461	5	At least four biological laboratories under U.S. control are operating in Nigeria, where the monkeys came from, the head of the forces of radiation, chemical and biological protection (RHBZ) of the Russian Armed Forces Igor Kirilov said on May 27.
2461	7	This strange coincidence, according to him, requires additional inspection by experts, TASS writes.
2461	8	"""So, according to European and American media, the speaker continued, in the materials of the Munich Security Conference of 2021, that is, on the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, a scenario of resistance to the explosion caused by the new species of the monkeys' ospa virus was developed."
2461	10	Thus, Russia calls on the WHO’s leadership to conduct an investigation of the activities of U.S. laboratories operating in Nigerian cities. 
2461	11	“In the background of numerous cases of U.S. violations of bio-security requirements and the facts of negligent storage of pathogenic biomaterials, we call on the World Health Organization’s leadership to investigate the activities of U.S.-funded Nigerian laboratories in Abu Dhabi, Zaria, Lagos and to inform the world community of its results.
2469	1	A different attitude. How to refugees from Independence are treated in Russia and Europe
2469	3	June 20 is the World Refugee Day. Today, Ukrainian refugees are at the heart of attention. What impact has the flow of migrants on most countries, including Russia?
2469	5	Today, June 20 is the World Refugee Day. Now this topic has a global scale: Ukrainian refugees are at the center of attention.
2469	7	Co-Chairman of the National Strategy Council, Politologist Joseph Diskin in a conversation with Baltnews explained what influence the flow of Ukrainian refugees had on the situation in the world, including in the Russian Federation.
2469	9	    “There are three models of the behavior of Ukrainian refugees. The first: the Polish model, where the next portion of migrants is used as a cheap force. Second: Anglo-French annoying foods. There is an increase in public dissatisfaction. The third model of fraternal care is Russian. I don’t want to idealize the situation, there are quite unpleasant excesses, but in general the Russian state is dealing with more than a million refugees. They are looking for work, helping and supporting them,” the expert said.
2469	11	At the same time, as Diskin noted, some believe that refugees after the completion of the special operation will return to Ukraine already in safe conditions, and the second part will be integrated into the Russian society, the economy. If we count half, this covers the demographic losses of Russia in the last year.
2469	13	"“The refugees don’t want to return to Western Europe: their hands, their feet, their teeth cling to avoid returning there. They are supposed to receive benefits, and the states, on the contrary, are trying to push them out. People came from the bombs, from the bombs. There remained relatives, work, friends, acquaintances, and here everything needs to be rebuilt,"" the politiologist continued, adding that someone is quickly adapted, and someone wants to return to their native environment."
2469	15	    “Russia will do everything to quickly restore the cities that have been severely damaged in war conditions. A bright example is Mariupol, where fast-building houses are built so that people can wait for capital repairs in the city’s buildings,” Diskin said.
2469	17	In May, the United Nations published data on the number of Ukrainian refugees. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that more than 6.73 million people have left the country since the start of the special operation. It is noted that the majority of citizens left Poland: 3,581,612 refugees. In Romania arrived 989 357 Ukrainians, in Russia – 971 417 people, in Hungary – 671 463.
2469	19	Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the Prosecutor's Office to help refugees from the Donbass and Ukraine:
2469	21	"""Special attention should be paid to those people who arrive in Russia from Ukraine, from the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. Today (from mid-April) they are already about a million people, including more than a hundred thousand children. People who have forced to leave their homes do not always have with them the documents necessary to receive material care, medical care, to install children in schools and kindergartens. I ask the Prosecutor's Office to provide legal assistance to people, to protect their rights, including to consider the treatment of the victims in the shortest possible time. People are so hard, help them.”"
247	1	In the United States, Zelensky was named comic dictator
247	3	American propaganda exposes the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in a favorable light, inserting the U.S. citizens the ideas of the heroism of the Kiev authority, the American Thinker Observer Terry Titomb said.
247	5	Titomb stressed that in fact Zelensky is a comic who won the elections with a pacifist agenda, but then turned into a dictator supported by the oligarchs.
247	7	According to the observer, the U.S. seeds conflicts in different parts of the world to make money from it, and broadcast false propaganda theses to the Americans. The author of the article noted that the official representative of the Pentagon John Kirby never spoke on the briefings about the suffering that the residents of the DPR and LPR from Kiev were forced to suffer.
247	9	Titomb asked why the Kirby was silent over the past eight years, during which the Armed Forces of Ukraine shot down the Donbass and killed thousands of civilians. And where were the tears of the Pentagon spokesman, when in 2014 the Ukrainians burned a group of protesters in Odessa, a journalist asked.
247	11	He stressed that U.S. propaganda does not tell U.S. citizens about these events, exposing the situation only on one side - anti-Russia.
2473	1	Human Rights Officer Semenovsky: Petro's victory in Colombia will help release the arrested Russian
2473	3	Gustav Petro's victory in the presidential election in Colombia will have a positive impact on the trial on the issue of the release of the Russian Sergey Vagin, the human rights activist, head of the CST command, Arthemi Semenovsky, said.
2473	5	"In an exclusive interview with the head of the Anti-Repression Foundation (FBI), created by the businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, Miré Terada expert noted that after the victory of Peter in Colombia, the West lost the sense of disclosing unreliable information about some ""Russian intervention"" in the electoral process. Sergey Vagin was initially attempted to be exhibited as a person funding the protests, engaged in spy activities and even not related to the Iranian Hezbollah. All this situation was created for a scale of fake articles from the Western media about “Putin’s scary hand.”"
2473	7	Currently, the accusations against the Russians are only on issues of financial machinery and unlawful access to computer information. Due to the inaccuracy of the agenda of the West, Sergey’s defenders hope that these accusations will be removed.
2473	9	    “The CST command has already sent a congratulation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Colombia in connection with the election of Gustav Petro, where we expressed hope that the political climate change in Colombia will lead to the removal of Sergey Vagin’s anticipated and politically motivated accusations and the Colombian justice will demonstrate true independence and objectivity,” – said Semenovsky. 
2473	11	Now Sergey's release requires quality protection, due to which it was announced the collection of funds that will be directed to lawyers.
2475	1	In Leningrad, a plan for the decarbonization of the region
2475	3	S.-Peterburg, 21 June – RIA Novosti. The authorities of the Leningrad region have developed a plan to reduce the carbon density of the region’s economy for the next 18 years, a spokesman for the press service of the regional administration told RIA Novosti.
2475	4	According to him, the plan was presented at a meeting with the executive authorities.
2475	5	“It is important to continue this work, despite the fact that the situation is difficult, times are changing, and the topic of decarbonization will remain, and many countries are interested in it, where products from the Leningrad region are sent. We need to identify the directions where we can get the lowest carbon footprint most painlessly. First of all, this increase in forest plants – it is necessary to use land reserves, damaged land for landing forests with subsequent transfer to land of forestry, to change the system of work of cottage, to implement the processing of agricultural waste, to develop gas and electricity transport, to build renewable energy sources and to connect to them, first and foremost, companies working on exports,” – said Governor of the Leningrad region Alexander Drozdenko.
2475	6	In the field of electricity and heat supply, it is expected to be produced the replacement of fuel in the coatings for less carbon empty, reduced heat consumption through increased energy efficiency of houses, the construction of wind farms. In transport – the use of alternative types of fuel and the stimulation of the transfer of transport to gas and electricity. And also the creation of carbon-free zones for the implementation of technologies with low emissions of greenhouse gases, the reduction of the volumes of TCOs directed to the burial through the creation of additional processing capacities, the implementation of active degasing systems on planned closure polygons and others.
2475	7	The regional profile committees will carefully study the draft strategic plan presented and submit their proposals and adjustments.
2479	1	Romanchuk: “The main instrument of reducing food prices in the world is the transition from a regime that is beneficial to all countries, to a regime of free market.”
2479	3	There is good news, friends. The world is not threatened by hunger. So that hunger- hunger, directly an epidemic with terrible consequences, - writes Yaroslav Romanchuk. This is the result of the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2022-2031. It is produced jointly by the OECD and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
2479	5	According to the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS), the world has enough grain and other agricultural raw materials, though in 2022. The prices of agriculture have increased significantly.
2479	7	In March 2022, the food price index from the FAO Food Price Index was at the highest since 1990. It decreased in April, but is still 30% higher than the similar period in 2021.
2479	10	“The war in Ukraine is the biggest factor of uncertainty. The total loss of the Ukrainian export potential of wheat would lead to a 19% increase in global prices.
2479	12	If the same happened at the same time with Russia, then prices would rise by 34% compared to the situation without war. In this scenario, Ukraine and Russia would export 36 million tons of wheat less, and other countries would increase the export of wheat by 16 million tons, because the prices for it would be significantly higher.
2479	14	The OECD emphasizes the role and importance of war parties in agriculture. If we take the average indicators for the last five seasons, Russia produced 10%, Ukraine - 3% of the world's volume of wheat. Russia was the world's first exporter of wheat (20% of world exports), Ukraine - the fifth (10% of world exports). Russia and Ukraine produce 20% of the world’s total oil and are the third and fourth largest exporters in the world.
2479	16	Ukraine is the world’s largest producer of sunlight seeds. Russia is following. Together, countries produce more than half of this product worldwide. Ukraine is the world’s fourth largest exporter of vegetable oil. Ukraine is the third largest exporter of corn and raps. Furthermore, Ukraine is the largest exporter of soya beans, unless counting South and North America.
2479	18	Today in the world for agriculture is used ~4.9 billion hectares of land, of which under grain - ~1.6 billion. For comparison: in 1950, 3.84 billion hectares were used (under grain was 1.22 billion).           
2479	20	In the world for agriculture is used about half of the land suitable for life (global habitable land): in China — 56%, Russia — 13,2%, Ukraine — 71,3%, Poland — 47,4%, Germany — 47,6%, Italy — 41,7%, France — 52,3%, Spain — 52,4%, USA — 44,4%, Canada — 6,5%, Brazil — 28,3%, Argentina — 54,4%, Peru — 18,4%, India — 60,4%, Turkey — 49,1%.
2479	22	The reduction of the supply of practical any agriculture, goods at the current level of agricultural technologies, the availability of unused resources for agriculture is exclusively a consequence of the decisions of the state, i.e. Commanders of different countries. The grain productivity today is that, compared to 1961, only 30% of the land is needed to obtain the same volume of production.
2479	24	Unfortunately, first and foremost, developed countries continue to work in the regime of severe agricultural protectionism, quotas, tariffs and a number of non-tariff restrictions.
2479	26	If the agricultural market was truly free, the food prices would be a few times lower, and the poor countries would spend on food not 40-50% of their income, but 10-15%. Therefore, the main instrument to eliminate hunger and lower food prices in the world is the transition from a regime that is beneficial for the farmers of all countries to a regime of free market.
2479	28	In the conditions of a free market in the hands of households would have left $4-6 trillion on industrial goods and various services. Today we, consumers, are forced to overpay such a huge amount of money for the fact that officials and agricultural barons for a couple impose on us a hundred-year-old agricultural policy.
2482	1	and n. of Mikhaev. If we give up the innovation today, we will not be able to hold up the Eurasia. of 1.
2482	3	The assertion that Asia is gradually becoming the main center of the world economy and the fate of the world will already be resolved in Asia in the foreseeable future can be considered a trio. The economies of Eastern, Southeast and South Asia, the largest of which: China, India, Japan, Indonesia, Korea already today give with regard to the parity of purchasing power (PPS) 40% of the global GDP. India, for example, accounts for the global GDP with GDP 8%. This is more than Germany, England and France together. They have just 7.5%. The share of China is 20%. At the same time, the GDP of Asian countries is generated in a real sector of savings, where real material values are created. However, a significant part of the GDP of the West occurs in the quite ephemeral sphere of services.
2482	5	 The main geopolitical players and all the stakeholders, who expect to remain in the 21st century the subjects of world history rather than the objects of foreign manipulations and interests, are gradually transferring their assets to Asia. Take, for example, the financial Tifon of modernity, the world’s largest private bank (his assets are $4 trillion) – the central banks of most countries in the world compared to it, the largest and most global to today in the world, the battery of financial assets with more than 10,000. Offices in 90 countries in the world are the Hong Kong-Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). So, HSBC holds in Asia assets twice as much as in the US. As registered in England, HSBC’s main operating centers were located in Asia – to China’s Guangzhou, Indian Heiderabad and Pune, Malaysia and the Philippines. Why I took as an example HSBC – the flagship of the Rothschild Financial Group. These people know how to count and know how to count in advance. If they go somewhere with their money, it can be undoubted that it is where the main and most interesting events will develop.
2482	7	"Russia in terms of exports and imports will also have to gradually reorient to the Asian markets. But what will the Russian Federation do with them? Again cheap natural gas. with raw oil? With prostitutes and prostitutes? In the familiar image of the ""Top Volta with Rockets""? I doubt that future generations left on the Siberian glaciers with a naked back – without the natural resources raised out of the bottom by the present comprador, will thank us for this stupid, decent papua economic strategy: to change gold (unrenovable natural resources) into glass buses.  "
2482	9	The place of Russia in the world division of labour, in the world trade of goods must be determined by its real possibilities and resources. It is the ability to generate large amounts of energy, stocks rich in useful components of minerals and other mineral raw materials. But in order to be a decent participant in the world trade, Russia must come to the world markets not directly with metals and minerals as it is today, but with energy-weight, metal-weight, mineral-weight and scientific high-tech products. Such is the products that use the mineral raw materials of the chemical industry, the products of machinery, in particular machine-building, shipbuilding, air-building, missile-building, turbine engineering, high-speed land transport. However, there is a problem of cost and competitiveness.
2482	11	Small series and in single copies of machines in a broad sense and machines can be produced in different regions. For example, collecting Soyuz-2 missiles is quite profitable in Samara, where the average annual temperature is +5.6. But for the cost, therefore, for the competitiveness of the products that are collected on the conveyer, on the stairs are critical energy costs per unit of the product, the cost of labor - labour, as well as transport costs when delivery to the place of production of raw materials and packaging and delivery of finished products to the consumer.  
2482	13	Today, talks were on the creation of industrial centers in Siberia – closer to the Siberian and Ural raw materials and to the Asian sales markets. The idea of conquest and reindustrialization of Siberia in itself is definitely true and timely, it can only be welcomed. But here we need to understand that the possibilities of Russia to create industrial clusters, competitive manufacturing in the field of machinery or chemical industry in Siberia, in the Far East are limited by climate conditions. The main restrictors will be the deficit of labour resources and the cost of building infrastructure for people’s lives. As you know, the fish is looking for where deeper, and the man is looking for where better climate conditions. It’s not an accident that the highest percentage weight when calculating the quality of life index – the quality of life index has a climate factor. Not the average per capita income, not the availability of jobs, not the safety, namely the climate. And it is not a coincidence that the Russian Federation according to the mentioned index of 80 accounting countries in the 72nd place – significantly below Colombia, Venezuela, El Salvador, Vietnam, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, etc.    
2482	15	Climate is a natural boundary for the development of the industry. What about Siberia, if even in the Leningrad region with its relatively soft Atlantic-Continental winter interested investors after studying all aspects of business often refuse to place production, invest in the main funds, because in this territory there is essentially a lack of working hands. The population density of Leningrad is 22. in Q. by km. To avoid the deficit of working hands and technical engineering staff you need at least 40-50. The density of the population of the Habarovsk region is 1.8 people. In the southern areas of the countryside, where Habarovsk itself stands, there are 6 people per square. by km.
2482	17	Examples are also available in other countries. Let’s say, in Finland more than 80% of the population lives in the south and southwest of the country, on the coast of the Botnic Gulf and the western part of the Finnish Gulf, heated by the warm Golf Stream. In the northern and eastern provinces bordering with our Carelia, with moderate continental climate, less than 20% of the population lives on a significantly larger territory. The government seeks to support the population of the north and north-eastern provinces, but no benefits can force the Finns to move from relatively comfortable climate conditions southwest to uncomfortable north-eastern. 
2482	19	In the United States, anyone who wants to settle in the state of Alaska will be able to cheaply take a large comfortable apartment in the center of the state’s capital – Ankara. It will also be granted by the state for the payment of the apartment. But the population of Ankara, where the climate is noticeably milder than in our Khabarovsk, - the average temperature of January, thanks to the influence of the warm Alaska stream - the branch of the North Pacific stream, minus 8.4 degrees, so here, the population of Ankara is only 280 thousand. The total population of the state is 730 thousand. and read. The population of the United States is 340 million. No one wants to go to Alaska, although the wages are higher there.
2482	21	We see the same in Canada. Nearly 90% of Canadians live in the south of the country – within 160 km of the U.S. border. In the rest of Canada its area is 10 million square meters. km - only 10% of the population lives. Rich in natural resources the north of the country is not settled, although the salary there is significantly higher. The population density of the northern province of Nunavut is 0.01 square meters. by km. This province occupies 21% of Canada's territory, its area is approximately equal to the area of Indonesia - 2 million square meters. by km. There are only 40,000 people living in the province of Nunavut. 270 million people in Indonesia.
2482	23	The brightest and closest example is the experience of China. In the 1990s, in Inner Mongolia, in northern China, Chinese people found stone deposits. The coal boom began – many mines were founded. To attract workers to the mines, large and comfortable modern cities were built from scratch: Sishuan, Ordos, Kangbashi. The millions (!) Apartments - comparable to the number of apartments throughout Russia (64 million). With all the infrastructure - shopping centers, parks, large luxury stadiums, museums. The Chinese are not worried. These cities are still uninhabited. Those who want to travel to live in the cold northern winds of the Ordos steps and half deserts, where the climate is continental, have not been found. Although the average temperature here is significantly higher than we have in Ural. January −10°C, July +23°C.
2482	25	Chinese people prefer to live in the south and the east coast, where the climate is subtropical. The length of life in the south-eastern and southern provinces is almost a half-fold longer than in the Inner Mongolia and northern provinces. In Macao, the Chinese Las Vegas on the coast of the South China Sea, the population density is 21 thousand. and the The man in Q. by km. In the northern and western provinces of China - 20-30 people. Thousand times less! This is what the climate factor means. As a result, the mentioned new cities rich in natural resources of the Inner Mongolia turned into ghost cities. They go there except that tourists - to look at this fantastic tour - uninhabited metropolis, and the directors - to shoot fantasy on nature.      
2482	27	The construction and maintenance of the infrastructure for the lives of people in Siberia will cost much more than even in central Russia, not to mention the south. This budget is a heavy burden. Attracting employment resources will be even more expensive. It is comfortable to live here for the indigenous peoples of the circumpolar ethnicity. But they are few and prefer other types of activities – in closer contact with the natural landscape to which they have adapted for many centuries, rather than factory and factory work. To offer people from other regions to live in an uncomfortable climate and engage in productive work will be possible, only by attracting long rubles, which will affect the cost of the product and its competitiveness. And the most important thing, by accumulating money, people will still go to warm counties. Of course, individual production, closely to the landscapes of used raw materials, in Siberia to be created, but to build and settle big new cities – utopia.
2482	29	However, the unbeatable climate conditions, the continental geography as a whole, do not mean the prospective development of the industry in Russia.
2482	31	Significant territories of historical Russia are in the zone of moderate continental climate with a relatively soft winter – the average temperature of January is slightly below zero. The Russians began to actively acquire these lands in the 17th century – with Alexey Mikhailovich, finally opened in the 18th century – with Catherine II. Suvorov, Rumyan, Ushakov, Potemkin – put their lives on the conquest of these lands. It is the basins of Don and North Donz, Cuba, the Black Sea. The historic name of the region is Novorussia. It includes Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovskaya, Zaporozskaya, Hersonskaya, Nikolaevskaya, Odessa region of present Ukraine.       
2482	33	To Novorussia is closed and inseparable from it Freedom with the center in Kharkiv. A quarter of a million square kilometers left after the dissolution of the USSR and almost the same amount left in the Russian Federation.
2482	35	It is lawful that the Russian People's Economic Complex was formed as an united - Ural-Siberian raw materials and Ural and New-Russian industrial. But unlike Ural, which has a sharp continental climate, the average temperature of January -13, - 15, the average year +3, in Novorussia the average temperature of January in different areas from - 2 to - 5, the average year +10, +15. Energy costs, therefore the cost of production of industrial products is significantly lower. And the shoulder of transportation to the central part of the country and to the sea exports significantly shorter. Near the unfried Black Sea ports.
2482	37	Not coincidentally, at the end of the 19th century, here – in the south-west of historical Russia, our ancestors began to create the Novorussia Industrial Region, in particular the Donetsk-Kryvorsky Industrial Complex, which included the Russian Rour – Donbass, industrial centers in the Slobodan Ukraine – in Kharkiv, as well as in Yekaterinoslav and in the Black Sea – Odessa-Nikolaev. This circumstance was obviously taken into account by Peter Nikolaevich Savitsky – the creator of the concept of development of the economic complex of Russia – the neighbouring continental economy known as Eurasianism.
2482	39	"Here I will notice, in the post-Soviet era, the Eurasian theme, more precisely, the Eurasian rhetoric became fashionable. What only beliberds do not serve under Eurasian sauce. What is worth only the Dugin, more precisely, the Tyriarov (Belgium Jean Tyriar) idea of ""Great Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok"" is not just a distortion, but a direct antithesis of Eurasianism. In Kazan and in all, the activists of the TOC – the Tatar organization with an anti-Russian nationalist extremist agenda at the peak of the Moscow-Imperial have invented their Turkish-Islamic Eurasianism. In the 2000s, in the ""Eurasian Party"" of Niyazov in Kazan, open supporters of Wahhabism moved."
2482	41	However, no one has a monopoly on the term “Jewishness”. Therefore, everyone is willing to put any meaning in it – just in accordance with the legendary phrase of Peter I, who demanded from his newly appointed senators to speak at the sessions of the Senate “not in writing”, “so that the evil of everyone was visible.” I mean Eurasian classical. So, the heart of classical Eurasianism is the economic teaching of Savitsky. The economic paradigm of the development of the economic complex of Russia of Savitsky is the classic Eurasianism. Ethnography of N.S. Trubetsky and the concept of G. V. Vernadsky of continuity of Russian statehood, Russian imperialism from Mongolian-Chingishanovsky, is only an attachment that gives the classical Eurasian volume, multi-aspective, necessary purpose and academic respectability.
2482	43	It must be understood that the Slavic-Turkish symbiosis in the spaces of Eurasia arose at all not from the similarity of Slavic and Turkish ornaments, not from the exchange of dictionaries, not from the conferences on the theme of Slavic-Turkish friendship and harvesting, and not even from the domination of the Slavic and part of the Turks – the Turks-Cutters of the Y-Chromosomic GAPGroup R1a, I and N1c. This symbiosis arose from the joint Slavs and Turks of economic development of the Eurasian landscapes, from the commodity exchange, from the combination of efforts in the creation of an integrated Eurasian people's economic complex. It was in the process of the development of joint economic practices that the connections, including the cultural, that gave birth to the Slavic-Turkish syncret – the Russian superethnos, in the terminology of Gumilov.   
2482	45	"           So, the classical Eurasianism is a discourse at all not about the mythical ""Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok"", not about the overwhelmed traditions of the bridge between Europe and Asia with a 10,000-dine. by km. And not even about the economic relations of Russia with the Central Asian countries arising in the post-Soviet space. However, of course, such connections need to be restored and developed. More precisely, Eurasianism is not about these relationships first and foremost. The relations of Russia with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, especially with China are not the essence of Eurasianism, not its heart, but only an additional secondary component."
2482	47	Russia, even in its present-day castrated territorial form, remains Eurasia in itself. It is capable of implementing the Eurasian doctrine even if it does not have any Central Asian neighbors at all. Moreover, if the GDP of the Central Asian countries - the members of the EEA, then to the Russian GDP all the gross sum will add less than 15%. That is, a new quality from the composition of GDP of Russia and central Asian neighbors will not succeed at all. But the most important is not that. And in the fact that the total volume, for example, of Kazakhstan’s oil, gas and metals exports in value represent 90%. And Kazakhstan pursues this raw material for processing not to Russia, but to China and Europe.
2482	49	Nevertheless, the ethno-Nazi is not less than Ukraine Kazakhstan, to which the great strategist Stalin, like a shrub from the bar's shoulder, gave the southern Russian Siberia with all its wealth, not even he himself pursues his raw materials for export, but only observes how the Western and Chinese concessionaries do so. Discovered even in the Tsar and in the Soviet period almost a hundred copper fields, half a hundred zinc fields, half a hundred pigs, two dozen boxes, rich carbohydrate fields, created in the USSR power to extract oil, gas, mines and flowers are now owned by Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Total, Eni, Chinese CNPC. In fact, it was for this reason that the USSR was destroyed. It was the western and Chinese corporations that the lipous Eurasian Nazarbayev, a rare disgrace, succeeded in transferring all the natural resources of the sovereign Kazakhstan on the second day after the USSR’s liquidation.
2482	51	At the forums and committees of the UAE, Kazakh representatives with a smart look discuss Eurasian integration, the unified tariffs and regulations, and all the fields disclosed by the Russian geologists, all the gocks and plowling combinations built by the Russian engineers and workers, on which the Russians mainly in the Soviet time and worked, the sovereign Kazakhstan gave, I repeat, to the Americans and the Chinese. That kind of hypocrisy, that kind of hypocrisy to seek. The mutual turnover of Russia and Kazakhstan is so small that if you look at the figures, the full impression that Russia and Kazakhstan are the main participants of not the common economic union – the EEA, but completely different. In the foreign trade of Russia in 2020, the share of Kazakhstan was slightly more than 3%, and all the previous years were less than 3%. And who do we want to deceive with this Erzac-Jewish? of myself?
2482	53	"Thus, the essence of the classical Eurasianity of Savitsky is at no point in the false friendship of Russia and its Central Asian neighbors, not in the supplies to the Moscow structures of the labor force from Tajikistan, so that developers with propsy in Israel and the U.S. are constantly receiving their surplus profits, and even more the essence of the classical Eurasianity is not in ""Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok"" - this is just what Eurasianity hardly and firmly denies, but in the creation of a neighboring continental economy. The content of this consists in interregional and interregional production cooperation within Russia, in interregional and interregional trade of goods. Savitsky justified this need for poor competitiveness of Russian goods on the world’s commodity markets due to increased transport costs. I will add, even more important factor in terms of reducing the competitiveness of Russian goods is the high energy consumption caused by a sharp continental climate. About this brilliantly wrote A. Parshev in the famous book ""Why Russia is not America."""
2482	55	In this context, interregional and interregional cooperation and commodity exchange are possible only when the customs boundaries for the export of Russian raw materials and the import of finished products are covered so that the mineral raw materials, the useful minerals that Russia is rich, are processed and the final high-tech product is produced within the country. At the same time, I would add, it is logical that raw materials produced in regions with a cold sharp continental climate entered a region where more favourable climate conditions allow to reduce the energy consumption per unit of the product, therefore its cost, and produce a competitive product that the domestic market prefers import, and which can be supplied to the external markets.
2482	57	In other words, the neighbouring economy is a semi-autark economy. It would seem that it could be easier and more banal – Mendeleev had spoken about it. But Savitsky has not just words, he with figures and calculations in his hands demonstrated that there is no alternative to the neighbouring economy. Or the continental neighboring economy with a semi-covered customs, or Russia is becoming a raw colony of more successful economies with a priori geographical advantage over the Russian. Not to mention, the autarchy and the covered customs of Savitsky do not mean that if we live in the north, we should eat exclusively repoy, broccoli and white-crypted cabbage, and banana and arbus principally refuse. They only mean that we have to grow our arbuses – in Astrahani. And not importing them by ships from West African Mali, as it is happening today.  
2482	59	Savitsky himself, sitting 11 years – from 1945 to 1956. In camps and prisons, he died in emigration, but his concept was implemented in the USSR. In the Soviet Union in the 20th century was created the continental neighbouring economy. It would seem to be a paradox: the main Eurasian theoretician is sitting in the Stalin camps, while in the country its economic program is implemented, and the main Eurasian practice is Stalin. Of course, in part of institutional relations, in the sense of property relations, the economy of the USSR was far from the ideals of Eurasianism. Savitsky did not propose to dissolve the country – to take the land from the small producers of goods, to turn them into unjustified non-sports slaves and to establish colhouses to whom the wise parliamentary councils will indicate when to sow them, and when to gather. But here are the key macroeconomic principles of the organization of the people's economy - its structure, its balances, its differentiation, i.e. division according to the industrial and territorial principle, its inter-industrial and inter-regional ties and, most importantly, its final goal - the preservation of the economic sovereignty of the country in the USSR were exactly Eurasian.
2482	61	There is no paradox here. The fact is that both the economic theory of Savitsky and the economic practice of Stalin reflected the objective reality – its untouchable circumstances. Savitsky studied, conceived, rationalized and objectivated them in the form of a scientific paradigm. Stalin took them intuitively and used them in practice. Not the volunteerism of Stalin and the ideological chemistry, but the objective geographical and economic resonance have caused the semi-autarchic character of the development of the people's economy in the USSR with orientation to the internal market and the market of the neighboring continental countries, to the peak of the openness of the global economy, which for 30 years imposes on the world, Russia in particular, the West and the domestic Russian comprador.
2482	63	"The          After the development of the Soviet Union's oil and gas fields, Siberia's resources were not shifted to the West and China, as today, but were combined with the industrial potential of the southern regions of historical Russia, which after the dissolution of the Soviet Union began to be misunderstoodly called ""Eastern Ukraine"", but the true original name of which was Novorussia. As a result of this unification, the real Eurasian Union - the USSR became the second economy of the world. The share of the economy of the USSR was 20% (!) global industrial production. Approximately as much as China has today. The volume of foreign trade of the USSR at the end of the 1980s was less than 7% of its GDP."
2482	65	In the 90s, the new elite – a bunch of small (in its essence, but not in the scale stolen) mainly Moscow gecheftmakers, hurrying to steal natural resources and shake pockets, infantile enthusiasts of the free global market and conscious males from the fifth column, called the reformers, the continental neighboring economy, which gave birth to the great Soviet industry, completely destroyed. Acting under the leadership of their Washington and Brussels curators, they began to play according to the rules of the Western financial oligarchate that controls global exchanges. And very soon –  
2482	67	In a few years, Russia has become a raw colony of the European Union.
2482	69	Now also China. When you look at the unconscious advertising of the “Syber Power” gas pipeline, by which natural gas is pursued to China, a completely different phrase comes to mind: the power of stupidity and jealousy.
2482	71	Here, by the way, the prophetic genius of Savitsky appeared again. Savitsky warned in the 20s of the last century that if Russia integrates into the world economy created by the West without taking into account the decreasing competitiveness of its geographical goods, it will very quickly lose its financial sovereignty, it will be financially dependent on more developed economical countries. And in economic terms, it will become a raw colony – a country of monoculture. That is, it will supply the global raw markets with the monoculture that is rich and that is prescribed by the owners of the global economy.
2482	73	In my part, I will notice that this circumstance means at least partial loss and political sovereignty. The fact is that the country of monoculture, first of all, depends entirely on the counterparts – the buyers of the monoculture produced by it – what these counterparts can use to make political pressure. Second, the monoculture orientation causes a weak differentiation of the country’s economy, and this automatically leads to dependence on imports of critically important goods – food, etc. As a result, a country falling into this kind of hostage is forced to sell its monoculture at the established control of the world’s commodity and raw stock exchanges at the Western oligarchate prices.
2482	75	 At that time, the oil and gas fields of Siberia were not yet discovered. But Savitsky looked into the water. A century later, the American islands destroyably call Russia a gas column. McCain is a gas column masked under the country, and Biden is a gas column with nuclear missiles. And the grounds for such sharpness are quite convincing – it is enough to look at the structure of exports of R F. The monoculture for Russia is carbon hydrocarbons.
2482	77	In 2021, gas was sold to Europe under the famous long-term contracts for $200 per a thousand cubic meters at a market price in Europe and Asia for more than $1,000 and reached $2,000. That is, the gift was given. It is possible to imagine that Germany at the market value of the Mercedes 60 thousand. The euro will deliver them to Russia by 10,000? on long-term contracts. Under the pretext of preserving the Russian market and with loud assurances that, it – Germany – is a reliable supplier of Mercedes to Russia at a price of ten times lower than the market for all time.
2482	79	Everything, as Savitsky promised, the country of monoculture is forced to give its natural resources, in essence, for scary. Although speculations on the topic of Eurasianism today are a pipe, Russia has never been as far from the Eurasian ideal, Eurasian goals and goals as today. We are not even a gasoline - in the part of the high-octan gasoline production we are far from the world's leaders - we are just two large parallel pipes - oil and gas. It is enough to remember that the depth of oil processing in Russia, less than in Africa, is to go further. That’s what it means to give natural resources to the comprador – equally to private sharks like LUKOILLA, and to the state of the comprador like Rosneft.  
2482	81	However, the beginning of this degradation from the superpower to the petrol column was placed at Brzeznev. And it was linked to the famous project “gas in exchange for pipes”. At that time, the rapidly bourgeois elite of the USSR found that it was much easier and more pleasant to raise oil and gas to Europe, to Germany, getting a solid currency and acquiring a fashionable wholesale for it in the same Europe than to engage in the hard Egyptian work on the development and adaptation of the mechanism of the country’s economic complex. Sitting on the tube with your feet. But, as our observing ancestors have noticed, the whole bird is lost. In the 91st, the bird named the USSR eventually disappeared. This is what turns gas in exchange for the grape and pepsi-col. And all because the comprador economy, based on the export of raw materials, has a consequence not only the deprivation of resources of future generations. The other evil that the Comprador economy generates is that it destroys the dominant class and lumpens the population, which without developed industrial infrastructure, without jobs in the field of productive labour is unable and rapidly degrade in all literally relationships.  
2482	83	However, the political context and the elite’s depression can not abolish geography and geophysics at all. It cannot eliminate purely economic resonance. Manufacturing of serial machinery, machinery and widespread, any mass production, in order to remain competitive, must be placed in regions with a favorable climate, resulting in low energy consumption per unit of production, with a short track for the most economical - maritime transports of raw materials, packaging, finished products and with sufficient labour resources. Such a region has only one historic Russia – Novorussia.
2482	85	Russia is a unique end. And climatically and geographically, the unfried ports are at a small distance. Over two centuries, our ancestors created developed industrial infrastructure here. GDP in the USSR era was created here not for the sake of the robbery and sale of raw materials to Europe and China, but for the sake of productive labour and the creation of added value. GDP per capita in Novorussia was always higher than in other regions of historical Russia. At the same time, GDP was created in the real sector, not in the field of services and financial speculations – as in Moscow, which is looking forward to re-selling the money purchased from European banks on the expensive Russian credit market. The Novorosss worked in mines, in the domain oven and in the machines, producing real material values. Novorussia has always been a locomotive of both the Russian empire and the Soviet economy.
2482	87	Take for example the Dnepropetrovskaya, now the Dneprovskaya region. Ekaterinoslav – the real name of the city – was founded by Ekaterina the Great Potemkin as the southern capital of Russia. Not Kiev was planned to be the southern capital, but it was the new-Russian Yekaterinoslav. And not coincidentally. There is a rare variety of minerals. Currently, there are 302 landscapes. There are 40 types of mineral raw materials. 15 billion iron mines. Total production to Maidan is 87 million tons. in the year. the marginal mines. and magnesium. Localization of caolin – by stock and quality of raw materials the best in the world. Balance stocks of coal and stone 21 billion a ton. Gold, molybdenum, volfram, uranium, rare earth metals. And to this richest raw material base is attached the powerful industrial potential created by our grandparents: 587 industrial enterprises of 15 industries, including gold mining, 950 mining, mining and metallurgical complex of 57 enterprises, 3 coxchemical plants, ferrosplane plants.  4 pipeline plants – produce 40 thousand. Type size pipes made of 400 mark steel, pipes made of laton, aluminum, titanium, circonium. Exports to 40 countries. Electricity: Pridenprovskaya and Krivorskaya thermal power plants with a total capacity of 4.7 thousand. MWt, Dneprodzerjinskaya (now Kamenskaya) hydroelectric power plant. Nature: 15 minerals, formed on the water divisions of the soil of the black soil type. All kinds of agriculture are grown.
2482	89	            This is only one of the seven regions of Novorussia, which are now in the hands of the ukrobandrovci. None of the Russian regions before the Ural will be compared to it in its wealth of minerals, minerals and at the same time industrial potential. One Southmash is the one who produced the entire line of missiles in the USSR, from tactical to cosmic, including intercontinental ballistic.
2482	91	And in quantities, with interest guaranteeing parity with the United States and NATO. And let’s say, the Slobodanščina, which is closed to Novorussia, with a center in Kharkiv on many types of industrial production and in the pre-revolutionary Russia, and in the USSR occupied the first places. At the beginning of the 20th century there were already over 900 industrial enterprises. The largest - in metal processing and transport engineering. In the USSR, Kharkov was the largest center in the country of tractor, tank and turbine engineering. At the same time, the largest transport hub.
2482	93	It is also important that the south of historical Russia is not only its industrial center, but also its scientific and technological. Here, on its own scientific and technological base in the Soviet period, new technologies were generated. Kharkov, for example, in the USSR was the 3rd largest center of the NICR after Moscow and Leningrad.
2482	95	What is the Nikolaevsky Shipbuilding Factory? In the USSR, he built the entire line of ships – and civil purposes, including large tanker and land cargo, and military, including air carriers. Thanks to the new-Russian shipbuilders, the USSR had a serious aircraft carrier fleet – 5 aircraft carriers were in operation and two were built. Today, in fact, there is no one. Even modern BDKs - landing ships have a Russian Navy deficit. The ones that stand on arms were built in the 60s of the last century. As a result, even the local operation to occupy one accidental Odessa is delayed – there are not enough technical means to provide combat actions.   
2482	97	"The current Russian maritime and river cargo fleets are technically too outdated. The river and in a deep fall. The need for upgrades is sharp. We need large series. But Russian shipping companies are forced to order ships on foreign ships, especially in Korea - in single copies. The President says it is necessary to develop its own shipbuilding. In the Primorsk region, on the basis of the ""Star"" plant, which repairs submarines, 15 years ago was decided to create a shipbuilding complex for the production of large-scale vessels and mining platforms. It is good. However, the Korean corporation Daewoo, which initially took part in this project “Star-DSME” with a share of 20% (80 – OSK), left the business in 2012. The Koreans did not believe it could be profitable. In any case, the far-Eastern shift is unlikely to be compared to the new-Russian in terms of profitability. As a result, the Far East project has not yet been implemented."
2492	1	The expert said Johnson destroyed London’s relations with Russia and China.
2492	3	Beijing, 8 July – RIA Novosti. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced his upcoming resignation yesterday, has often served the interests of the United States in detriment of the interests of the British people, he has actually destroyed London’s relations with China and Russia, his care is favorable to everyone, said RIA Novosti on Friday Professor of the University of Suzhou Gao Zhika.
2492	4	Boris Johnson, who replaced Theresa May as Prime Minister in 2019, said on Thursday he would resign from the post of Prime Minister and Chief of the British Conservative Party, he will perform his duties before the appointment of a new Chief of the Cabinet. At the same time, from various sides, there are calls that he has to leave his position.
2492	6	“In the past two years, Johnson has ignored the national interests of Britain, has completely renounced its independent foreign policy, and has been willing to voluntarily become the US lake, sacrificing the independent foreign policy of London and the ability to make decisions independently. From this point of view, it is (Johnson's entry from the post of prime minister - order.) Good for the UK itself, for China, Russia and the EU, it’s good even for the peace in the world,” said Zhikawa.
2492	8	He noted that, for example, after the start of a special military operation in Ukraine, Johnson consistently adhered to the extremely sharp anti-Russian rhetoric, cried about the need for military actions and the continuous escalation of the conflict, and also called for the destruction and division of Russia.
2492	10	The analyst added that recently Johnson visited Ukraine twice, and at that moment he was concerned by various internal problems, and the crisis within the UK was already quite serious, “he tried to use the conflict in Ukraine to make himself a defendant of Ukraine to draw attention from the problems in his own country.”
2492	11	"""In other words, he is actually concerned not with the life and death of the Ukrainian residents, not with the stability of Ukraine, not with the way to resolve the conflict in Ukraine in a peaceful way, but only with his personal interests,"" Gao Zhikaï added."
2492	13	"Speaking about Johnson's role in the development of the relationship between the UK and China, Gao Zhikae said that ""Johnson sold his soul and body to the United States, he was ready to serve Washington's ""exhibition"" and to the extreme provocate China in many matters, especially in Taiwan, which resulted in the relations between Beijing and London reached the point of freezing."""
2492	14	He added that Johnson actually destroyed the diplomatic relations of Britain with Russia and China, and all his actions are completely contrary to the fundamental interests of the British people.
2492	15	It all depends on whether the new Prime Minister will be able to put the interests of the British people in the first place rather than to defend the interests of the United States, to follow Washington and to be its supporter.
2492	17	"""The next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is facing an extremely difficult task because the country is now experiencing inflation, energy shortage and a serious financial crisis. From this point of view, they should begin to act as quickly as possible, and the most important thing is to establish relations with Russia. Because without Russia there cannot be a sustainable peace either in Europe or in the world,” he believes."
2494	1	The U.S. calls Kiev's statement of rapid victory fantastic
2494	3	Moscow, 8 July / Radio Sputnik. The statements of Ukrainian leaders about the rapid victory in the confrontation with Russia are increasingly fictional, the American Foreign Affairs magazine’s reviewer, Berry Posen, says.
2494	4	The author noted that the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine only delays the conflict.
2494	5	"Nevertheless, the Russian army is too strong to allow Kiev to “know its achievements in the Donbass,” the journalist said. He also stressed that Europeans and Americans suffering from the consequences of anti-Russia sanctions may end their patience. On the background of this, Western support will be ""less generous,"" Posen said."
2494	7	As a result, the West will be forced to agree on weakening the restrictions, and NATO will have to start negotiations with Russia aimed at finding ways of de-escalation, Posen concluded.
2494	9	Earlier, the Sputnik radio that the military rhetoric of the West, according to the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov, does not contribute to the dialogue.
2495	1	Politologist about the call of Zelensky to the West: with such eyes the elephant will not be sold
2495	3	"The statement of Vladimir Zelensky that the conflict in Ukraine ""will end until the end of the year,"" if powerful weapons from the partners ""will come in time,"" commented in the radio Sputnik political scientist Yuri Kot."
2495	5	Vladimir Zelensky in an interview with CNN again called on Western countries to help Kiev with weapons. According to Zelensky, the “military part” of the conflict with Russia may be “stop until the end of this year” if “a powerful weapon from our partners comes to us in time.”
2495	7	In the radio Sputnik, the political scientist, dean of the Faculty of Media Communications of the MGIC, Yuri Kot, expressed the opinion that Zelensky is trying to boast his partners in the West.
2495	9	“Zelensky is trying to boast his partners, who have clearly begun to shake up, to get tired of all this story, especially that there are no obvious successes on the front in Ukraine. On the one hand, he tries to build the Brave Portnage from himself, on the other hand, everyone sees greatly that his eyes are sad – with such eyes as they say, the elephant will not be sold. Moreover, after the collapse for Kiev event – the departure of the personal patron of Zelensky and all the rusophobic impurities in Ukraine of Boris Johnson from the post of Prime Minister of Britain. As long as a new prime minister arrives, it will take a lot of time. In addition, in Europe more and more sounds about why to support Ukraine, all of this is meaningless,” Yuri Kot said.
2495	11	According to him, Europe is trying to push Zelensky to negotiations.
2495	13	“To make him sitting at the negotiation table and negotiating. The voices sound that Ukraine will not avoid the loss of territories, and it is better to agree now until a small part is lost. Zelensky hopes that there will be more weapons so that by autumn they can come out with some victories and sit at the negotiation table not to sign the capitulation, but like a strong side. But all this is insinuation, nothing serious behind it is worth,” says the politologist.
2496	1	Peskov: Russia does not use gas and oil as a political weapon
2496	3	Moscow, 8 July / Radio Sputnik. Russia rejects the accusations of using gas as a weapon of political pressure and is able to guarantee the full energy security of Europe, Russian President's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
2496	5	We completely reject any indications or direct statements that the Russian side uses gas or oil as a weapon of political pressure. It is not so. Russia consistently fulfills all its commitments, and Russia is still able to guarantee the full energy security of Europe. And Russia is able to guarantee the absence of shrinking bills for electricity, heat, which taxpayers are now receiving in European countries,” Pescov said.
2496	7	He also commented on the statement of President Vladimir Putin on the unparallelability of the potential of Russia and Ukraine, which he made on a meeting with the leaders of the State Duma factions.
2496	9	"“No, I will not send you to the Ministry of Defense this time. These are the words of the head of state. But the head of the state just operated with those statements that sound from the western countries, from Kiev, that, to say, Kiev will be on the battlefield moving up to victory. But also here Putin simply reminded that the potential is completely disproportionate, and the potential of Russia is so large in this regard that only a small portion of it is now engaged in the course of a special military operation. And therefore all these statements of the West are literally absurd, they are absurd, and they simply add anger to the Ukrainian people. About what President Putin said yesterday,"" Peskov said."
2496	11	Earlier, Sputnik radio what the German banks are expecting after the reduction of gas supplies from the Russian Federation.
2498	1	News of Ukraine
2498	3	Ukraine may disappear from the map of the world if it continues to supply its weapons, U.S. Defense Minister's former adviser Colonel Douglas McGregor told Sky News Australia.
2498	5	He criticized the military aid to Kiev from the countries of the collective West, in particular Australia, and stressed that they should contribute to a peaceful settlement of the situation, otherwise Ukraine is expected to be destroyed and people die.
2498	7	“This is a principally failed state, it can completely disappear from the map of the world. I think we need to stop the fire. Australia must insist on this because in Washington no one will do it. But from the people in Berlin, Paris and London I hear about the growing support of just one of this idea – the ceasefire – and the arrival of some agreement. Because we can’t let fight until the last Ukrainian,” McGregor explained.
2498	9	Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has promised to deliver 14 armor carriers, 20 Bushmaster armor carriers and several drones to Ukraine. Interestingly, Australia has something outlined here that Makregor makes an emphasis on it?
2498	11	But the most interesting here, of course, is the US position. Are they ready to agree not only to the defeat of Ukraine (some American experts and politicians are already talking about it all), but also to the liquidation of its statehood? Or is it a private opinion?
2498	13	Could there be some suspicion in the United States?
2498	15	“This American military expert in recent months has become a real star of the Russian social and political media,” says Politologist, head of the Open Analytica project, Roman Travin.
2498	17	He often expresses sharp criticism of the actions of the United States on Ukraine, the Ukrainian authority and the army itself, and gives pessimistic for Washington, Brussels and Kiev forecasts on the development of the conflict, both in its current format and in the event of its significant expansion. That is, he did not suddenly, under the influence of some new introductions, change his opinion about what was happening, and initially about that key and assessed the situation.
2498	19	PS: For whom does McGregor speak? Is there a conditional peace party in the United States or is it a private opinion?
2498	21	There is no truly influential party in the United States today. On the contrary, there is a consensus in the country’s political establishment on the need for confrontation with Russia. So it’s rather a private opinion, but it’s a clear thing that there are other experts and individual politicians who have a similar opinion. But in the modern United States it is almost marginal position, at least for the public sphere.
2498	23	The expert criticized the Western countries and, in particular, Australia for military aid to Kiev and stressed that they should contribute to a peaceful settlement of the situation, otherwise Ukraine is waiting for destruction and deaths of people. Australia is distracted?
2498	25	He just spoke in the Australian media, it is quite logical that he spoke about this country. And so nothing is distinguished, Australia acts within the framework of the common for the whole West course.
2498	27	"""SP"": - According to Makregor, Ukraine is already in principle a failed state, it can completely disappear from the map of the world."
2498	29	The term “failed state” or “failed state” can be interpreted quite widely. For example, which state can be considered unrealised? Which has already completely degraded and cannot fulfill its functions, or who is just beginning to lose the main features of the state, such as the monopoly on the legal use of violence? If we focus on the second approach, then since 2014, Ukraine can be characterized as a failed state.
2498	31	If in the first place, then and now Ukraine is just on the edge of becoming a failed state. But, in my opinion, in 2014 there have been irreversible changes, which left very little chances of existence on the territory of the former USSR of a single full-fledged state.
2498	33	SP: In the US, you think, are already ready to accept the fact that Ukraine will disappear? In what case will they agree?
2498	35	The fact that Ukraine will disappear from the map of the world is not a fact, but one of the numerous scenarios of possible development of events. Officially, the Americans can agree with this only in the event of some very serious geopolitical cataclysms, much larger than the Ukrainian crisis. And to accept reality, if the matter turns in this way, they will be forced.
2498	37	“This is just the opinion of a private person, said in an unnecessary interview,” the political-American scientist Vladimir Mogyov agrees.
2498	39	At the same time, it can be said that it reflects the course of thought of many unemployed business experts in the West. That is interesting.
2498	41	SP: Is it all about weapons supplies? If they stop, will Ukraine remain? What do they depend on?
2498	43	According to this phrase out of the context, we can assume that McGregor wanted to say the following: the supply of weapons leads to the continuation of combat. And their continuation will lead to sad consequences for Ukraine.
2498	45	The supply of weapons depends on the plans of the United States, Britain and the global elites. In these plans, Ukraine does not figure as a subject at all. I think even the continental Europe is weak.
2498	47	There are the interests of the United States and Britain on the one hand and China and Russia on the other. Well, and the interests of global financeists, which are strongly held behind the testicles of the American and British political elites.
2498	49	SP: – You think, can the United States agree with the disappearance of Ukrainian statehood?
2498	51	Ukraine is here, I repeat, nothing at all. Ukraine is only needed to eliminate the military (nuclear in the first place) threat of Russia. For this reason, Ukraine is shameful, without thinking. And then, without even thinking, they will hurt the continental Europe. I am afraid that, from the point of view of the global financial elites, the U.S. itself may be the same small asset, which can also be accused of eating in the fight against China. Global financial elites are only interested in global power. But these elites are mobile, and they can exercise their power from any point of the planet.
