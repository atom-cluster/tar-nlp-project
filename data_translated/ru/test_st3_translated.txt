341	1	The White House has started panic on the background of OPEC+ decision
341	3	“In the White House there was a kind of time of panic. OPEC+ shocked the free world by the sudden decrease in production... even more of your money... will be spending on heating your housing and higher fuel prices for your transportation. And there is nothing good in that and in the other,” he quotes RIA Novosti.
341	5	According to Kimid, it is unlikely that the U.S. administration has a plan to get out of the current situation. He brought the example of the time of Donald Trump’s presidency, when in the U.S. about 10 million barrels of oil were produced a day.
341	7	The television broadcaster noted that current U.S. President Joe Biden broke his promises and decided to ask for help to Iran and Venezuela instead of burning the roofs.
341	9	On October 5, OPEC+ oil producers agreed to cut production by 2 million barrels per day since November.
341	11	The spokesman for the Russian President Dmitry Peskov called the OPEC+ solution a victory of a good sense.
341	13	U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the U.S. is considering a number of options to respond, including in relations with Saudi Arabia, to the OPEC+ decision to cut oil production.
341	15	The Washington Post later said that U.S. leader Joe Biden was disappointed by the OPEC+ decision.
3410	1	Western eco-activists have ceased to consider carbon dioxide harmful to climate
3410	3	Under the conditions of the forced return to use of coal in the West rehabilitated carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.
3410	5	Even recently crying about the danger of coal and hydrocarbons for the Earth's climate, the scandalous Swedish eco-activist Greta Tumberg, suddenly said that carbon dioxide is a plant food, the foundation of all life on Earth. It fully supported the statement of the Climate Intelligence Foundation, in which it says that global warming is not harmful to nature, so it is time to end the climate hysteria around fossil fuels, reports NewsFrol.
3410	7	In order to justify the return to the use of coal in the conditions of refusal to purchase Russian gas, the “progestered” Western ecologists announced that additional carbon dioxide emissions into the air will contribute to the growth of the global plant biomass, which is beneficial for agriculture and guarantees increased productivity worldwide.
3411	1	Britain calls on the Trace to publish a plan to tackle the energy crisis
3411	3	British business associations demanded the future British Prime Minister Liz Trass to immediately present a plan to support entrepreneurs suffering from record-high electricity prices, the Financial Times writes.
3411	5	The head of the Association of British Chamber of Commerce, Sarah Howard, said that, like households, companies unbearable increases in their accounts, how difficult it was for them to find new contracts at a fixed price to protect themselves from further prices.
3411	7	“If the new prime minister does not address these problems immediately, then the economy will continue to move towards dangerous waters, and the prospects, both for and for consumers, will actually be unpleasant,” he said.
3411	9	"The head of the Federation of Small Business of the UK, Martin McTag, welcomed the fact that in his pre-election promises, Trace did not overcome the side of the small business, but noted that it was not protected by any limit price for electricity and that the price for light ""rises without any control."""
3411	11	"The head of the Make UK association, Stephen Fipson, said that the business ""at this time needs decisive action from the new government to help it pass through a long stage of unprecedented rise in electricity prices, raw materials prices and critical lack of workers."""
3411	13	On Monday, British Foreign Minister Liz Trass became the new leader of the Conservative Party and will take the post of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
3411	15	As previously by Sky News, current Prime Minister Boris Johnson will transfer his powers to the new party leader not earlier than September 6. On the same day, Queen Elizabeth II will take both of them in the Scottish Castle of Balmoral, and on 7 September, a traditional session of Prime Minister issues will be held in the parliament.
3411	17	The elected leader of the British Conservative Party and the new Prime Minister of Britain, Liz Trass, in her first speech on the new post promised to respond to the energy crisis.
3412	1	Everyone decides the court: why Boris Johnson's replacement with Liz Trace won't change the UK's policy
3412	3	With the change of the Prime Minister of the UK, the policy of the kingdom towards Russia will not change – England will continue to “guide” our country, says Deputy Deputy Oleg Matweichev. In a conversation with the FAN correspondent, the politician stressed that the owners of a residence on Downing Street can change as much as they want, and the royal branch is one. And that’s what she has been holding the path to confrontation with Russia for centuries.
3412	5	"“Anything depends on the identity of the Prime Minister in the UK’s policy towards Russia. Everyone thinks that in English politics the decision is made by the prime minister, and the queen is only a nominal governor. However, the owners of the residence on Downing Street can change as much as they want, but the royal branch remains always - everything decides the court,"" the politician said."
3412	7	As he said, since the times of Ivan Grozny, when diplomatic relations between Russia and England were established, this country is only engaged in one thing – “going our country.” This is in line with its geopolitical strategy. The English consider themselves a sea power, Russia is a continental, so the continent for them is a chess plate, and they themselves are the player who leads the party. Their task was always to destroy the empires that tried to appear and exist on the territory of Eurasia, Matweichev explained. Therefore, in any way hurting and confronting all peers: nations, religions, classes, and even gender, is the constant work of the British.
3412	9	"All the laws and all the politics in this case are determined by the queen, now Elizabeth II. Naturally, this policy is continuous and is carried out in the spirit of monarchs-predecessors who have been playing games against Russia for centuries. Therefore, evaluating the adequacy and degree of Liz Trace’s rusophobia has no sense. The English policy towards Russia is always to be the enemy of our country. All the worst bodies that have caused us evil have always found asylum in England. All damages have always been sponsored by the British. And some boundary of this hatred was not and is not,"" the FAN spokesman said."
3412	11	Matweichev also reminded that the Cold War, which is associated with the confrontation of the US and the USSR, was not declared by the US President, but by Winston Churchill. And in modern history there are moments confirming British hegemony. When the U.S. presidents were just trying to even call for a reboot of relations with Russia, a voice from London immediately spread calling for pressure on our country. According to the policy, Russia has no worse enemy in the whole country than the UK. And the current situation with Ukraine, this also applies, because London is behind Kiev’s shoulders.
3412	13	In response, in my opinion, Russia should have one goal: the disappearance of the state of England. As long as it exists, there will never be peace for us, Russians. By the way, with the disappearance of the British state will become easier not only to us, but also to many peoples on Earth. There will be peace and peace,” Matthews concluded.
3412	15	It was previously known that, according to the results of the vote, the post of Prime Minister of the UK will be held by Liz Trass. According to reporters, the current head of the government Boris Johnson will transfer powers to the diplomat not earlier than September 6.
3413	1	Medvedev talks about the war against a part of the dead world
3413	3	Medvedev declares Russia’s struggle for its land and a thousand-year history
3413	5	Russia is currently fighting for its land and people, as well as its thousand-year history. This was on Friday, November 4th, in his Telegram channel by Deputy Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the occasion of the National Unity Day celebrated in the country.
3413	7	At the same time, the country has to lead war with a whole part of the dying world, the politician emphasized.
3413	9	“We are fighting against those who hate us, who prohibit our language, our values, and even our faith, who plant hatred to the history of our Fatherland... This is a bunch of mad Nazi narcissists, the humiliated and scared by them people, and the big stone of the hunting dogs from the western puppy,” Medvedev explained.
3413	11	At the same time, he expressed confidence that Russia will surely win in this conflict.
3413	13	Earlier in November, Medvedev said that Western countries, supporting Ukraine and declaring the need not to let it lose in the conflict with Russia, are provoking a global war with the use of nuclear weapons.
3414	1	MAMUKA MDINARADZ: The U.S. Embassy today first recognized that the “MTAVARI ARCHI” appears to the Party Media of Georgia, 3 November, Gruzinform. “Today, the U.S. Embassy first acknowledged that ‘Mtavary Archive’ is a party media, which we have talked about so long,” said Mamuca Mdinarazze, a member of the parliamentary majority, commenting on the statement of the U.S. Embassy on the decision of the Court of Appeal to leave the Director-General of ‘Mtavary Archive’ Niku Gvarami in prison.
3414	3	As Mdinarazze said, a very important detail is that the U.S. Embassy talks about the leader of the party, i.e. the main opposition media.
3414	5	“As for the criticism of the judicial system, I would like more clarity. When you criticize the judgment, criticizing such common phrases leads to ambiguity. When you say something wrong, you have to explain why. When you criticize this way, without specificity, it is a blow to the court, which is very bad. It would be much clearer if the statement had specific arguments. I suspect that well-trained people who made this statement did not have a specific argument, the more specific legal arguments, so they had to make a general statement. As not surprisingly, in this statement it was not about the arrest of the head of the objective media, even another similar epite was not applied, and the statement of the embassy is about the party media. This is a very important detail that the U.S. Embassy talks about the leader of the party, i.e. the main opposition media, so the U.S. Embassy today for the first time acknowledged that it is about the party media that we have talked about so long. Along with criticism, we saw the recognition that it was a party media,” Mdinarazze said.
3414	7	“As Georgia’s commitment to an impartial judicial system and media pluralism is a subject of special attention, the statement of the head of the opposition television channel Nikki Gvarami threatens the clear choice of the Georgian people and the declared goal of the Georgian leaders – a safer, democratic, European future,” the U.S. Embassy in Georgia said in a statement.
3414	9	The embassy responded to the decision of the Court of Appeal to leave Niku Gvarami in custody.
3415	1	Referendum on accession to Russia will give people confidence - officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPR
3415	3	Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Affairs of the DPR Andrei Lihachki said that the referendum on the accession to Russia will give people confidence.
3415	5	“The decision on a referendum on the accession to Russia I evaluated in 2014. We thought we would join the Russian Federation in the 14th year when the first referendum was held. I was one of the initiators of the referendum in my area. Now it is more and more necessary, as the hot phase of fighting is passing, the people need to give the spirit and confidence in themselves,” the fighter says.
3415	7	According to him, the people of Donbass will have faith in the future and defence. When we enter the Russian Federation, a lot will change and human victims will not be useless.
3415	9	The referendum on the entry of the DPR into Russia will take place from 23 to 27 September.
3416	1	“Russia is stability.” Inhabitants of Marrakech talked about expectations from the referendum
3416	3	Inhabitants of Mariupol said they are expecting from the referendum in the DPR the attack of peace and stability
3416	5	Mariupolci are pleased to hold a referendum on the accession of the Donetsk People's Republic to Russia. The local residents told us what they expect from a new state of peaceful and stable life.
3416	7	They have hoped for reunification with Russia not only in the last eight years, but since 1991. Even then, the residents of the DPR did not understand why the division occurred. According to the interlocutor, there is a Russian-speaking people in the region, so everyone is pleased to hold a referendum. She has Russian roots, many relatives live in Russia.
3416	9	The man added that with the accession in Mariupol awaits attacks of peace and stability, jobs. The rest will apply. The people fear the return of Ukraine to this territory.
3416	11	“Russia is a stability, a powerful state where something is created, is built. In Ukraine, it is all overwhelming. You can see what Ukraine is a security guarantor. That’s all her guarantees – to bomb, break down, steal and escape,” he said.
3416	13	The referendum on self-determination began in the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, Zaporozhsk and Cherson regions. The vote will last for a few days. The head of the DPR Denis Pushilin called his conduct a historic wave in the life of the Donbass.
3417	1	The inhabitants of the Donbass on the referendum on the entry of the Republics into the Russian Federation show the importance of unity. This was stated in Luhansk by the observer at a referendum in the LNR from Slovakia, Lubica Blaskov.
3417	3	The referendum on the issue of the entry of the LNR into the composition of Russia on the rights of the subject of the Russian Federation will be held from 23 to 27 September. The vote will be held on the electoral spaces only on 27 September, the rest of the days - in specially organized places, including in the homeland territories. On the territory of the LNR, 461 parks of the referendum were organized, in the regions of Russia - 201.
3417	5	"“This is a historical process that will enter history. I will be part of this story. I think everything will go well and you will be joined with Russia. Unity is a great force. For many years we have been trying to unite. Especially the Slavs. And, unfortunately, many Slavs help Anglo-Saxons. I hope you will be the first to show all the other Slavs what to do, what to be together,"" the observer said."
3417	7	On the territory of the Republic, more than 20% of the total number of voters listed to vote took part in the referendum on the issue of the entry of the LNR into the composition of Russia on the first day of its holding.
3417	9	The referendum on the question of self-determination of the DPR and the DPR took place in the People's Republics on 11 May 2014 on the background of the initiated by the authorities of Ukraine in April of the same year of a force operation against the Donbass. For self-determination the LNR voted 96.2% of the participants of the referendum, in the DNR - 89.7%. On the next day, May 12, 2014, the state sovereignty of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic was proclaimed.
3417	11	Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the recognition of the sovereignty of the DPR and the DPR on February 21, 2022. He asked the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision, and then to ratify the agreement on friendship and mutual assistance with the Republics of Donbass. On the same day, Putin and the head of the Luhanese People's Republic signed a treaty on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance between the two states.
3418	1	"Pushilin said that the referendum on Donbass' entry into the Russian Federation would be ""a step into a new reality"""
3418	3	The conduct of a referendum on the entry of the Donbass into the composition of Russia is a historic wave, a culmination of the difficult path. This was stated on the day of the referendum by the President of the Donetsk People's Republic Denis Pushilin.
3418	5	“The referendum is a historic wave. Not only because we are confident in its positive outcome, but also because it is the culmination of our common difficult path,” he said.
3418	7	The Republic became an independent state, then gained recognition, and now unites with Russia, Pushilin said.
3418	9	“We’re returning home – this is the main motivation of all our affairs and battles. The secret desire and, at the same time, the absolute confidence that the day we will become Russia will come,” he added.
3418	11	Pushilin also called the referendum “a decisive step towards a new reality.”
3418	13	The historic referendum on the entry of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic, the Zaporozhsk and Cherson regions into the composition of Russia began in the morning of September 23. For security reasons, the three-day vote will only go on the place of residence, and the final day, 27 September, will be held in the electoral spaces.
3419	1	Iracli Kobakhidze: Unfortunately, the statement of the U.S. ambassador to the quarter was insulting, the ambassador did not answer any question
3419	3	As for the statements of former members of our party, we are constantly discussing this, discussing these topics at any meeting, — said the chairman of the “Gruzian Dream” Iracli Kobakhidze in the program “Free Vision” of the First Channel of Georgia.
3419	5	“There are tactical issues that we are discussing with former members of our team, but there are, so to say, certain values on which we are united. That is, there is no difference between us here,” Kobakhidze said.
3419	7	Asked by the program leader how much the team agrees with the information that the members who left the party communicate to the public, and how much the “Gruzian Dream” agrees with the content of their statements, Iracli Kobakhidze said it would be difficult to see the content of any statements.
3419	9	“Maybe if these letters are 100% true, if we confirm it, then we will become part of the tactics that we don’t like and in which we see risks. Second, the public controversy, we saw more risks in it. For example, questions were raised about the same financing and, accordingly, some questions were opened, of course, all this caused public interest and caused the public to be interested in what the U.S. funds were spent in Georgia. There was no answer to this question, and therefore this questioning sign remained in society. This can lead to some negative attitude towards our Western partners. The same questions, for example, were asked about the embassy’s approach to NGOs and the radical opposition. Then I watched the TV channel Imedi, there was an interview with the ambassador, the journalist asked these questions, and the ambassador did not answer any one question. For example, a journalist asked why only the “National Movement”, “Lelo”, “Vashadze”, Zura Japaridze and Elena Hostaria are present at all meetings, when the only sign of these five parties is radicalism. It does not meet, for example, with the “Citizens”, “Girchi” and other parliamentary political parties. There are non-parliamentary parties, and they meet with them, and they do not meet with parliamentary parties. This question was asked, there was no answer to it, and it causes some negative attitude towards our Western partners. We see this risk, and the prime minister also mentioned this in his statement,” Kobakhidze said.
3419	11	According to Iracli Kobakhidze, this is why there are tactical disagreements with former members of the team.
3419	13	In addition, Iracli Kobakhidze responded to one of the statements of the U.S. ambassador.
3419	15	“He is also forced here to respond to one of the statements of the ambassador, which, unfortunately, was offensive. There are four members elected by the people, and this formal side itself is not important? They have a special past. For example, Sozar Subari. What he did may be praised by a few, he was a public advocate and faced the most cruel regime at the most critical moment when it was worth people even at risk for life. There is Misha Cavelashvili, who has always been faithful to the principles and has been a fighter. There is Dito Hundadze, Guram Macharashvili, there are such people, except their formal status, and the ambassador said about them that they spread lies and dezinformation of the Russian type. If we thought that these people really spread lies and dezinformation of the Russian type, of course, we would be completely divided here in terms of content, but in fact it’s not the case,” Kobachidze said.
342	2	The US has described the scenario of a nuclear war between Russia and NATO
342	6	In the case of a hypothetical conflict between Russia and NATO with the use of nuclear weapons, the parties can destroy each other’s 30 largest settlements and economic centers, the opinion of the professor of Princeton University, Alex Glazer, the American newspaper Newsweek.
342	8	"According to Glazer, one of the creators of the collision simulator of Russia and NATO called ""Plan A"", the hypothetical nuclear war between the Russian Federation and the Alliance would play a terrible scenario and lead to the deaths of millions of people in the world in a few hours. The American newspaper noted that the audio-visual fragment, modeling the course of the nuclear war, became popular after the exacerbation of the conflict in Ukraine, although it was first demonstrated in 2017, reports RIA Novosti."
342	10	According to the researchers, in theoretical war Russia will be forced to respond to the NATO attack, which will then attack with tactical nuclear weapons from the air. If the situation worsen, the parties will be able to “destroy each other’s 30 largest settlements and economic centers.”
342	12	“According to the estimates, over the first few hours of the conflict, more than 90 million people will be killed and wounded,” he said. He also added that the consequences of the global thermo-nuclear war for life on Earth will be “unimaginable.”
342	14	“In addition to immediate damage, as well as economic and social collapse, there will be a nuclear winter that will exacerbate the catastrophe,” Princeton University professor said, referring to a study that showed that the nuclear conflict between the U.S. and Russia could kill more than 5 billion people.
342	16	On September 2, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded Russia of the condition of the use of nuclear weapons. A day earlier in the United States allowed the possibility of a nuclear conflict with Russia due to the death or injury of NATO soldiers on the territory of Ukraine.
342	18	At the end of August, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev said that Russia is carrying out a special military operation in Ukraine to prevent the Third World War. He also listed four reasons for Russia’s use of nuclear weapons, noting that one of them is actions threatening the existence of the country, which are not yet observed. In addition, Medvedev stressed that the Russian side has decided not to carry out a hard version of the special operation in Ukraine, as the consequences for this country would become destructive.
342	20	Berlin announces distancing Kazakhstan from Russia
3420	1	Iracli Kobakhidze: Kelly Degnan's statements are incomprehensible and cause regret
3420	3	We had meetings with the embassy representatives, and we tell them that there are no comments, legally everything is clean, and political comments are still going, and this is uncomprehensible to us and, first of all, it is regret, – said the chairman of the “Gruzian Dream” Iracli Kobakhidze in the program of the First Channel of Georgia “Free Vision” and answered the question about the law of hearing.
3420	5	The President of the “Gruzian Dreams”, evaluating the statement of the U.S. Ambassador Kelly Degnan, who said that “it’s a step back from democracy,” noted that this statement was incomprehensible to him and caused regret.
3420	7	“This statement is of course incomprehensible. When you don’t have a legal comment, and you say that, it’s incomprehensible. We talked a million times, we had meetings with the embassy, and we tell them that there are no comments, legally everything is clean, and political comments are still going and for us it is, of course, incomprehensible and, first of all, disappointing,” Iracli Kobakhidze said.

3421	7	 The aggressive and militarist policy of Ukraine towards the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, as well as the Zaporozhsk and Cherson regions, gives Kiev even the smallest chance of returning these regions to the composition of Ukraine, said RIA Novosti Chairman of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM) LNR Eldar Gambarov.
3421	9	"“After many years of attacks and constant Ukrainian aggression against the LNR, the DPR, the Zaporozhsk and the Herson region, there cannot be a speech about their return to the composition of Ukraine. This state, which is supposed to want peace, actually bombs and destroys our peaceful population. Let Kiev not even indicate us about a joint happy future,"" he said."
3421	11	The DUM of the LNR is under the canonical leadership of the Spiritual Assembly of Muslims of Russia (DSMR) led by Albir Krganov. We have already conducted a number of large joint activities. We have full interaction and understanding in all matters,” Gambarov said.
3422	1	Opposition in Georgia wants to revenge Ivanishvili for the 2012 election – Talakvade
3422	3	The largest opposition party in Georgia, the “United National Movement” (EDD) and the parties that have been removed from it, are still trying to revenge, for their defeat in the 2012 elections, when the party “Gruzinskaya Dream” passed power. This was stated on October 3 by the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Georgia, Archil Talakvadze.
3422	5	He commented on the disputes between the “Dream” and the opposition on the question of what mechanism of defining the “oligarch” should be used. The ruling party wants to adopt the law according to the model of the Kiev regime, but in the opposition against, as it does not fall under Ivanishvili.
3422	7	“They’re fooling society – the European Union did not actually say that a law should be adopted in which the only names and surname will be directly recorded, and the person who has made the most important contribution to the democratic reforms of the country,” Talakvade said.
3422	9	"Remember, on the request of Brussels to conduct a deoligarchization in Georgia in the ""Dream"", they replied that they would adopt a law similar to that adopted by the Kiev regime. According to him, the “oligarh” is recognized as such a big businessman who owns the media, influences politics and is the owner of a monopoly."
3423	1	The West hopes for Trump’s second arrival
3423	3	In the entire western civilization there is only one state activist capable of saving this very civilization from the accelerating decline and death. This man is called Donald Trump.
3423	5	Here, of course, we have to make all the necessary reservations: with this thought speaks a publicist, known for his excessive multitude and emotionality - he’s called Stephen McKenna, mostly published in American Thinker. But in this case, he proves his thought quite effectively. He pulls away from the exhibition, in fact, all the leaders of the first greatness at the funerals of Elizabeth II and says, “Well, you’ve seen them all here.” Who of them does something? They are only capable of self-destruction.
3423	7	In Russia and without McCain this phenomenon was noticed: here is at least the publication entitled “The West faced an antropological catastrophe.” That is, in Russian - with the birth of a whole political coherence. But in the publication of this conversation mostly about the fact that Russia, in fact, is not with whom to talk (if you take the leaders of only Western states). But McCain’s question is different: a whole civilization is dying, a whole civilization is destroyed, and some of the political elite is saved. Except for Donald Trump.
3423	9	Let’s see how specificly the breakdown process is going. It, according to the author, has three components. The first is the destruction of the foundations of culture which was the West. The second is the green transition, that is, the crazy attempt to stay without energy sources. The third component is us. That is, Russia and China, which will inevitably strengthen if the western march to death is not interrupted.
3423	11	“For a whole century, the Western societies were angry by the forces that were trying to destroy the traditional culture and moral values, because they believed that the state was more important than the family, the individual or the nation.” And Trump in his speeches admitted that as a result, too many people in the U.S. have lost confidence in American and Western civilizations and will not defend them.
3423	13	It remains to remind that we came to the USSR in the late 80s and 90s not to the West that Trump and his co-thinkers so love. And now it is in this repressive and hungry West, which does not want to defend. Simply the process of self-eating in us (and in them) was long and incomprehensible, but the broken curtain was waiting in his final.
3423	15	The second point is ecological. “The destruction of economies and standards of life due to the intention of destroying carbon fuel and nuclear energy.” However, the elites strongly claim that they believe: “theoretically healthy relations with the planet Earth require to make the hard-to-access energy, which is the blood of modern societies, and the side of all complications—economic or partially safe.”
3423	17	Here we can add that it is difficult for a normal man to believe that these very “elites” really want to return humanity (including the inhabitants of their countries) a couple of centuries ago. It often seems to us that this is what they want to get out of the game, and they don’t want to get cold and hungry. But those “they” with their mad actions constantly prove that they are busy with this. Although Trump was really doing the opposite policy, he strongly strengthened the U.S. economy before his opponents attacked it under the name of a “good recharge.”
3423	19	This is the third point of the Western catastrophe. According to Stephen McKenna, the picture looks like this: if the West will continue to consciously destroy the foundations of its society and economy, “this is Russia-China will command and control practically all economic activity in the world. This coalition will have a powerful production base, almost untouchable energy resources and a massive military and nuclear arsenal to plant its hegemony. This will put the United States and the peoples of Europe in their submission, ending the global domination of the Western civilization.”
3423	21	Here, you know, there are complicated feelings. Someone might think that from our or Chinese side there are much simpler motives of any action: so that we are not touched and have no physical ability to touch. To decide ourselves how we live, what values to respect and freeze in winter or warm up. But here we are informed that this very defensive position will lead to global domination. And whether we have to dominate everywhere and in everything, this is the question.
3423	23	Now about Donald Trump personally. Is it true that the only hope of the normal people in the West is to wait for the second arrival only of Trump and no more? If we talk about the stars of the first magnitude among Western politicians, it’s all right – there’s no equal to Trump. Moreover, and Trump was not expected, it was obviously not on the plan of the most destroying West. In fact, the coincidence.
3423	25	"From the very beginning, that is, since 2016 (the U.S. presidential elections), Trump looked like some enormous human normality among the most western elites, which were the result of an ""antropological catastrophe"" or the birth of the whole political composition. That is, he behaved as a normal person in a crowd of crazy people who met each of his understandable (smart, praiseful, stupid – but humanly normal) expression as a full shock and an unacceptable blow on the basis."
3423	27	There is nothing unusual in such a situation: the world history is full of examples of the appearance of a “man on the side” in situations where the existing political elite was completely unable to cope with systemic crises. In the history of France, for example, this is the appearance of the peasant girl, Jeanne d’Arc, who turned the turn of the war, which lasted a total of 100 years. (And you don't need to laugh comparing Jean to Donald, yes, he's not very similar to her.) In the history of Russia, something similar was with Minin and Požarsky. And every time the countries came in for a long time - and here a whole civilization...
3423	29	But the problem with out-of-system characters, and above all with Donald Trump, is that they serve as great symbols and know how to say the necessary words in time, but it is still necessary to know how to work long and hard to embodiment the expressed thoughts into life. Trump failed to do this, he was covered around the finger by characters from the “Washington Boat.” So to come back he may, and will come back, but what will happen next is a difficult question.
3424	1	Arno Hidirbegishvili: Fame and position are not synonyms of dignity
3424	3	“Hunting is disgusting, so I usually avoid any activity on social networks and selfie etc. Identified persons with subsequent posting photos on Facebook (photo with friends, of course, not in account). Unfortunately, today fame in society and high position are not synonyms of dignity and humility, although before in Georgia these things were in direct proportion. That is, the more known the personality was and the higher the position she had, the more modest the behavior and lifestyle she had.
3424	5	Why did you change your rules today and write these lines? I answer. “Kelly Degnan offered to Georgia defence weapons so that we are better protected from Russia!” – some “recognized persons” commented on my Facebook post on October 1. Here are they, the victims of many years of western propaganda with the aim of zombieing “new Georgians”, as well as the corrupt personnel policy – appointments to high positions of people without dignity, just if he had no shadows of nostalgia in normal relations with the northern neighbor! Well, I’ll have to answer these ambitious dolls trying to teach me mind-intelligence, say:
3424	7	The ambassador, more precisely, the U.S. in Georgia is misused by the fact that Bidzin Ivanishvili, the founder of the ruling party, the former prime minister, the de facto political leader of Georgia, acts decently and will never issue it, will not say, in return, what the U.S. offered to Georgia weapons for billions of dollars by the mouth of its ambassador. Kelly Degnan is sure that Bidzina Ivanishvili will never declare publicly - that she tried to deal with him during a three-hour conversation, specifically asking for it to visit the Glass Palace, then be - to him home. Here I want to note that the Caucasian Knights and male acts are not strange to me, but in the place of Ivanishvili, based on the national interests of my homeland - Georgia - I would, without different details, give the reason for her visit to the public - the main topic of the conversation.
3424	9	And even if so, if the U.S. was really useless and violently trying to give Georgia arms for billions of dollars, taking care of its security and well-being, then why did we never give it to us? What prevented, what conditions did Georgia not meet for this? Is it not time for Ivanishvili to declare war to Russia to force it to fight on two fronts – in Ukraine and in Georgia? Otherwise, what’s the same thing, did Georgia not previously receive with gratitude the U.S. military gifts?! So why did you give up American charity this time? To the act of donation no conditions, as you know, are not attached, who is better aware of this? But then it turns out that it was not a gift, isn’t it? It is excluded that the Minister of Defense and other “powerers” are not aware of this, then why are they silent “in the trap”? What else should happen to them to tell how today a group of four parliamentarians courageously declare what we said a year, five, ten, and more years ago, when one of these courageous people was not a drop of water with Saakashvili?The!
3424	11	"If the U.S. is the strategic partner number 1, the older brother and friend of Georgia, then why would they offer weapons on land-lize, that is, in debt, in credit? Isn’t it because, unlike the former, old and written, as the “Iroques” after Vietnam, the American “cadeons”, this should have been a new and modern weapon that is delivered to Ukraine today? And maybe any of these “recognized persons” who are trying to object to me on social networks will be so kind that they will explain to us – what is a “defence” weapon and what is it different from an offensive weapon? Even the electric shocker and the gas balloon is a beautiful offensive weapon, I am no longer talking about firearms and automates, especially missile complexes, portable jet ""Javelin"", or artillery ""HIMARS"". That is, “defence weapons” in nature do not exist, there is only the Ministry of Defense...”, – writes on his Facebook page the head editor of GRUSINFORM Arno Hidirbegishvili."
3425	1	What to expect from the appearance of the Mazepas in the Black Sea
3425	3	"After the pogrom, built by the Russian army to the Ukrainian fleet, he tries to recover. In Turkey for the Ukrainian Navy, the ""Getman Mazepa"" corvet was dropped to the water. What is the probability of a new Ukrainian ship appearing in the Black Sea?"
3425	5	"It can be reminded of the loss of the cruiser ""Moscow"", but this does not cancel the fact that thanks to the actions of Russia, the Navy of Ukraine in a few months almost ceased to exist as an organized combat force."
3425	7	At the present point, the Navy holds the Dneprovsky liman, which due to the circumstances under Herson holds the Russian Armed Forces, but at the same time does not carry the character of a critical threat. Kiev still has some boats, but these boats don’t get to the sea. Also, Ukraine has left one combat vessel – the SDK “Yuri Olifirenko”, but it is also engaged only in what is hidden. It remains a part of the marine special forces, but they are gradually killing it on land for Russian defense.
3425	9	Ukraine also has some number of anti-boat missiles that make the output to the sea dangerous for our ships. But with good preparation they can be shot down, and this is the last thing that the Navy has left. There are also losses in the personal team.
3425	11	Now the remains of the Ukrainian fleet can only hope for help from the West. The first fold was the two former British Sandown folders, Ramsey (Ramsey) and Blith (Blyth), delivered to Ukraine by the UK on September 30, 2022. These two very serious anti-mining ships.
3425	13	The two ships are now on the Clyde Naval Base in Scotland. Most likely, they will wake up there until the end of the conflict, at least because Bosphorus and Dardanella are closed for all military ships, including Ukrainian. But it is not possible to completely exclude the appearance of trailers in the Black Sea during the ongoing WHO – they are small enough to transport them through the Rhine-Mine-Duna Canal to the Danube and then through the river to the Black Sea, to move from the Romanian territorial waters to Odessa. This method is made up of a large number of diplomatic agreements with all the countries through which ships will need to be conducted. However, this is technically possible.
3425	15	"Later it became known that the first built in Turkey Ukrainian corvette ""Getman Ivan Mazepa"" was dropped to the water. ""Mazepa"" may not be just the most powerful vessel in the history of the Navy. It is one of the most powerful battle ships in the Black Sea, with the exception of the ships of Turkey. It belongs to the Turkish type “Ada” (Ada, island) and is a modern multi-purpose ship with a bright anti-ship inclination. It is not intended to attack ground targets. Although if you believe the reports that the ship is armed with anti-boat missiles ""Garpun"", then attacking the target on the coast he can still, ""Garpun"" have such a possibility."
3425	17	The ship is well protected from air strikes and missile attacks, in any case, in its nearby area. Its VL MICA-M anti-missile complex is supposed to be dangerous for targets at a distance of up to 20 kilometers from the ship. In addition, it is equipped with the artillery installation of Otto Melara with a 76-mm calibre and two 35-mm Erlikon automates. The vessel can attack overwater targets, but the most important thing is that it can fight the submarines.
3425	19	The ship carries the American shipping helicopter SH-60, has a modern hydroacoustic complex and shipping torpedoes. It is hard to say what type of torpedo is applied there. According to Western sources, it is MU-90 Impact. The torpedo is very good in the table characteristics, but monstrously problematic in the development of the fleets – in the Navy of Australia, its bringing to a combatable state took many years of hard work. How much Australian experience was taken into account in the torpedo series for other countries is unknown.
3425	21	Worse, if there are some other torpedoes on the ship, at least the American “star” Mk.46, there is no question about the ability of which to drown the submarines. Or the Turkish ASELSAN Tork, which can hit not only submarines, but also capture torpedoes going on the ship.
3425	23	Having this corvette, Ukraine can sharply raise its fleet’s combat potential. It will have at least one vessel capable of fighting the ships of the Black Sea Fleet of Russia. And with chances of success, especially if NATO intelligence will help.
3425	25	Initially, Ukraine had to get an unbuilt corvette and then build it in Nikolaev. Now this will not happen, and the ship will be fully built in Turkey. At the same time, under the cover of Turkish sovereignty, it will remain safe as much as Kiev considers necessary. According to open sources, Ukraine has also ordered another corvet of the same type, which, of course, has not yet been placed.
3425	27	The appearance of new combat vessels in the Navy and their secure transition to Ukraine until the end of the war actions, this happens in reality – an event that can be of great importance. If the EU agrees on the transition of the trailers, and Turkey releases a ship with the Ukrainian crew into neutral waters, then their destruction will be a urgent question for the Black Sea Fleet of Russia. The CF has absolutely all the tools for this – both in relation to the trolls and in relation to the corvette.
3425	29	"If the trailers and ""Mazepa"" will be transferred to Ukraine after the end of the USSR and the achievement of some peace agreement with Ukraine - then this is one story. If not, it is completely different. The point in this history is to be placed by the Russian Navy."
3426	1	Military expert compared special operations in Ukraine and Syria
3426	5	Russia can organize the most powerful missile attack on Ukraine from land, air and water and remove from the face of the land many objects of the Armed Forces. But there is a task of safeguarding civil infrastructure and not allowing losses among the civilian population, the military analyst Sergey Hatilev told the newspaper, commenting on the missile attacks of the Russian Armed Forces during the special operation.
3426	7	"""To solve all the problems with missiles during the special operation is simply impossible. In addition, the goal is to work selectively: not to break down civil infrastructure, and to minimize losses among the civilian population. This is a serious limitation for rocketers,” says Sergey Hatilev, former head of the Russian Air Force Special Destination Command. He explains that even high precision weapons have a circular deviation: “And we can’t risk.”"
3426	9	"The need for a missile attack on the armed forces is determined by specific criteria, the expert reminds. ""Today, each military chief himself decides about the usefulness and type of ammunition used. Let’s say, on the scattered objects, on the ground defense infrastructure to beat with powerful missiles is inefficient,” the Colonel said."
3426	11	At the same time, Khatilov notes that Russia has not yet fully used all the weapons it has today. According to him, today is discussed the issue of denitely controlled missiles, which were previously used in the S-300PS complex – missiles of the type 5B55. “They can now launch on ground targets, i.e. on the armored equipment, on the motor shooting troops. But again there is a ratio of the effectiveness of such missiles on ground targets, and this ratio indicates that they should be applied in the strictest need,” Hatilev explained.
3426	13	“Ukrainian special operations are sharply different from our combat actions in Syria,” the expert added. There were mainly VKS and ballistic missiles. Priority is given to the ground forces. But now the land troops are solving one of the biggest tasks – the occupation of territories. If we take the example of the DNR, there has been a huge number of ucreprion in the last eight years. It is not enough to bomb them with missiles. It is necessary to pass by the pedestrian, to eradicate all the “dirty” and only then the territory will be considered free,” Hatilev said.
3426	15	As a spokesman for the emergency services of the Herson region said on Tuesday, the Ukrainian military carried out an attack on the Antonov Bridge in Herson from the U.S. RSZO HIMARS. The last time the bridge was on September 25. At the same time, the Ukrainian military is trying to break the line of defense of the LNR under the city of Kremna, carrying huge losses, but the situation is controlled, said officer of the defense department of the Republic Andrei Marochko.
3426	17	Earlier in front of the LNR, Rodion Mirošnik told the newspaper VZGLIAD that Ukraine concentrated quite powerful forces in the border with the LNR areas, so our military has to build defence boundaries. The armed forces had already tried to break into the side of the oil processing plant (NPZ) located in Lishchansk, which happened two days after they entered the neighboring city of Red Liman.
3427	1	NATO continues to catch the situation in Ukraine
3427	3	Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald in an interview with Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News said America is losing connection to reality.
3427	5	“If a state has a nuclear weapon, and you think it can even theoretically use it, you need to treat this country differently,” Greenwald said.
3427	7	According to him, there is a sense in society that the use of nuclear weapons is an unrealistic scenario, despite the fact that the U.S. and Russia were very closely approached to causing mutual attacks.
3427	9	“In particular, during the Caribbean crisis, because the United States felt that the Russian presence at their borders, on Cuba, carries such a danger that it can lead to a nuclear war! That’s how Russia sees the situation in Ukraine, right on the other side of the border,” Grinwald added.
3428	1	How a couple of tweets changed the information war
3428	3	Information victories can only be on a short distance. They, of course, strike on the emotional state, but their results also pass quickly as new information causes appear.
3428	5	In today’s world, everything changes very quickly. This was perfectly felt by the Ukrainian side when Elon Musk posted on Twitter his idea of the resolution of the conflict in Ukraine.
3428	7	It is assumed that Americans, especially famous people, are unconditionally supporting Ukraine. In that number, Maska was recorded, taking into account what help he provided to the Ukrainian population and even the Nazis Battalion “Azov”*, who thanks to the technologies even in the subterranean “Azovstal” could publish their videos, which the Nazis participated not only in combat actions, but also in the information war. And the same Mosque made a blow to the entire Ukrainian community, which has become accustomed to that no one in the West is saying that it is necessary to hear the voice of the peoples of Donbass, Herson, Zaporozhya and so on the Crimea.
3428	9	The plan of Maska is quite simple – under the aid of the United Nations to hold repeated referendums, where people will once again say what is already known to everyone. Therefore, this option is not considered in Russia, as it has already been said that the above-mentioned regions are part of the Russian Federation and this is no longer discussed. But it’s not about Russia, it’s about the processes that Mask has launched.
3428	11	Such a thesis was previously impossible in the Western information space. Musk said that it is not in the root of the Kiev regime, but much more importantly, that this scenario will not be supported by the current U.S. rulers. And no longer so important is the reaction of the Ukrainians, who began mass attacks on the account of Musk, including politicians, and diplomats, and media personalities, who were expressed in no way by a censorship vocabulary, but by brave words to the multi-millionaire. More importantly, this thesis appeared in the American society.
3428	13	Within the U.S. everything isn’t so good, despite the fact that Washington by means of its actions in Europe moves to its territory. The next election, which the Republicans are expected to win, and the Democrats are not going to do again. It did not happen without the Ukrainian situation. Within the American society, there is a strong mood about the need to solve our own problems, rather than spending billions of dollars on military support for Ukraine. It is not clear to the public why because of the war somewhere in an unknown country their lives are expensive, and in all misfortunes Putin is guilty, although even the ordinary American is clear that not Russia has imposed sanctions that have provoked the crisis.
3428	15	But even if the Americans could get used to economic difficulties, the issue of the nuclear war worries them much more. For decades in the U.S. the image of “bad Russians” has been formed, who can hit with nuclear weapons and with their eyes do not murder. Such moods were strong in the 20th century, what to say about the present time, when only the lenius does not discuss the probability of such a result of events?
3428	17	Americans really believe that the Russians are ready for such a step, considering that Western media is talking about it daily, and the mass culture has long convinced the crowds that it will be. Therefore, no one wants to die because Ukraine desires to fight until the last Ukrainian, to join NATO and the EU, to occupy the territories that voluntarily entered Russia. And after the tweet, the Americans learned not only that people voluntarily made their choice, but also that Khrushchev made a mistake, transferring the Crimea to Ukraine. Moreover, the billionaire proposed a peaceful outcome of events, not the death of everything and everything.
3428	19	That’s why the Mask proposals were supported. And it must be emphasized that Musk is not a regular blogger or opinion leader who posted a popularist proposal in his account and that’s what it all ended. Nothing. It has an influence not only on the space or technical industry, but also on the politics within the United States. It is not a secret that he sympathizes the Republicans who just insist on a significant reduction in support for the Kiev regime.
3428	21	And this is the day before the election, Musk comes out with a statement that is supported by people. The same theses are spoken by the Republicans, who will win in the nearest vote. The U.S. policy vector is changing this autumn, and Ukraine will not receive former support. Of course, it will not rejoice Zelensky and the other party of war, who say that even a nuclear attack will not stop them from occupying the territories of the Russian Federation. But it must be understood that in some states the matter will not end. Europe is dependent on Washington, it’s already obvious, and even evidence was too much to repeat it. What will the EU do, whose countries are already refusing to provide military assistance to Ukraine? I think the answer is obvious here.
3428	23	One thing when some ex-politician from Romania speaks the theses that are unfavourable to Ukraine, but a different thing is a person with influence. The mask destroyed the first bone of the domino. This is the opposite side of the information war. Ukraine has been using the media machine for too long, and now it has faced with the fact that everything in a moment turned against it. Obviously, after the reaction of the political establishment of Ukraine, Moscow was only stronger convinced in his right, and his readers learned that in Kiev there are inadequate people who are ready to go down to direct insults to the one who was helping them, but spoke for peace, not for a nuclear war.
3428	25	Then “we’ll see.” It is a game in the debt. There has not yet been a cold and real crisis in Europe and the United States. And there, you see, there will be facts that will slowly, but will begin to destroy the image of the “offers” of Ukraine. And after that and the rest of the bones will fall and fall.
3429	1	A Strange Decree of the Ukrainian President
3429	3	Zelensky continues to beat records of extravagance. He can come into history not only as a “president in the mother with an eternally swallowing nose”, but also as the author of one of the most strange decrees.
3429	5	"The Decree ""inability to negotiate with the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin."" First of all, the question itself carries some intrigue – is it a conclusion or a ban?"
3429	7	In the first case, we cannot disagree with this. After all, Vladimir Putin has never negotiated with Zelensky and it is clear that he is not going to do that. And this, despite the numerous requests of Zelensky to talk to him, which came both before and after the start of the USSR. Everyone remember how on a press conference on March 4, the hardly crying Zelensky told journalists about how he prayed to Putin: “What do you want from us? Go out of our land. You don’t want to go now – sit with me at the negotiation table. I am free. Sitting with me, I am a normal man. “See with me and talk.”
3429	9	But neither then, nor before, nor after, the Russian leader did not make such prayers. And in the Kremlin repeatedly explained that they see no sense in such negotiations due to the absence of the subjectivity of the clown, who himself does not resolve anything, but only fulfils the instructions of the masters.
3429	11	It is clear that after so many unsuccessful attempts to “talk with Putin” Zelensky’s hands fell down and he lost all hope, acknowledging the impossibility to a conversation. But why to issue this decree?
3429	13	But maybe this is not a conclusion of the fact, but a prohibition? Zelensky has issued a document strictly prohibiting negotiations with Vladimir Putin. And who is he then addressed, who is he prohibiting such negotiations? It is clear that most of Zelensky, and all of his camarilla, are afraid that his owners will take and agree with Moscow without him and for his expense.
3429	15	Fear is something. But only the Ukrainian leader is unable to prohibit at least one, at least ten such instructions to conduct such negotiations to Biden or even, forgive me, to Macron. His jurisdiction extends to the territory of the former Ukraine, and that is no longer the whole. But in Ukraine and on its behalf, negotiations with the President of Russia can be conducted by Zelensky himself or the persons authorized by him.
3429	17	So it turns out that he by decree prohibits them to conduct themselves! But for what? Why does he, prohibiting anything to himself, inform all Ukraine and the world of this, formulating this personal tabu in the form of a presidential decree?
3429	19	The answer is only one: Zelensky doesn’t trust himself and fears that suddenly, breaking down and losing control over himself, he will stop negotiating with Putin. But since he had all predicted, then only he will have this intention, how the whole Ukrainian people will begin to catch him for the hands: “No, Vladimir Olesandrovich! Stop, you have prohibited it by the order!”
3429	21	Well, just like an alcoholic who understands that his will might not be enough to abstain from drinking, is encoded or swallowing himself the “Espiral.” The clown was also insured by such a decree, as a result of which the whole Ukraine understood: “What is this?” And he reminds that if with Kiev and talked in recent times, then only through third parties, through intermediaries: Erdogan, Macron, Muhammad ibn Salman Al Saud.
3429	23	It is possible, of course, and the third option: by signing the decree, Zelensky was hoping to admire the Ukrainians with his continuous cruelty, but something went wrong, and he drowned them into misunderstanding.
343	1	The hidden target of the United States against Germany and Russia
343	3	Moscow, 13 September - RIA Novosti. The U.S. is interested in exacerbation of the situation in Ukraine and the expansion of the theater of combat actions, writes on the pages of the Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten, the economist Christian Krys.The war with NATO involvement, the expert believes, could be for the official Washington a solution to the problems with overproduction and debt. The United States is expecting that the conflict in Central Europe will destroy a large part of the production capacity, but the most important thing the White House is trying to avoid is cooperation between Russia and Germany. Therefore, now Washington plans to destroy Germany, he concluded.He also noted that every day the economic forecasts in Germany sound more dark and darker. Over the country was the danger of negligence and deindustrialization, and the small and medium-sized are most affected.Today, CNN, referring to the sources, told the U.S. concerns that Europe under the influence of the energy crisis will change its position towards Russia and Ukraine.Western countries have faced an increase in energy prices and an inflation outbreak due to the introduction of sanctions against Moscow and the turn on the withdrawal of Russian fuel. Due to fuel, especially gas, the industry in the West has largely lost competitive advantages, which has affected other sectors of the economy. The U.S. and European countries have also faced a record inflation over decades.President Vladimir Putin previously stated that the policy of retardation and weakening of Russia is a long-term strategy of the West, and the sanctions have caused a serious blow to the entire world economy. According to him, the main goal of the West is to deteriorate the lives of millions of people.
3430	1	Trudeau accuses protesters of receiving money from abroad
3430	3	More than half of the financial aid protesters in Canada receive as part of crowdfunding campaigns comes from the United States. This was stated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the debate in Parliament.
3430	5	“These illegal blocks are actively supported by persons from the United States and other countries in the world,” the politician said. He also added that he opposes the use of force to the protesters, but “the decision must be taken by the police.” Trudeau himself accused the protesters of illegal and dangerous activities and urged them to leave the streets of the country.
3430	7	Earlier, the Bloomberg agency that the Canadian authorities began to freeze the bank accounts of the protesters. How many accounts were frozen, is not clear.
3430	9	The protest movement was formed after the restrictions against COVID-19 came into force, according to which every Canadian citizen without medication is obliged to be vaccinated. The temporary exception was made for long-riding passengers, but since January 15 they were also obliged to submit a full vaccination certificate or to be in quarantine for two weeks after returning from a foreign flight.
3431	1	The target of the crisis around Ukraine
3431	3	The US, pressing the rhetoric of Russia’s “invasion” to Ukraine, is trying to unite NATO members and strengthen the confrontation between Moscow and the European Union. The conclusion was made by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Global Times reports.
3431	5	“As the European members of NATO have recently become more and more distant from the United States, Washington seeks to take advantage of the difficult situation in Ukraine to separate Russia from Europe, to strengthen NATO cohesion and to strengthen control over the alliance,” the report said.
3431	7	Another goal is the desire to prevent the entry into operation of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline, fearing the formation of economic partnership between Russia and Germany.
3431	9	Earlier, U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of invading Europe. This is how the Russians act. They placed these troops on the border. We saw how they did it when they penetrated other parts of Eastern Europe,” she said. At the same time, the diplomat refused to explain what episodes in world history she meant.
3431	11	On February 17th, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin called the statements of Russia’s “invasion” to Ukraine a hystery. According to him, Moscow hopes that the West will change its behavior. “Now we look at our partners in western countries, capitals, and we expect them to draw the wave of this hystery regarding the intentions of Russia in the region,” he said.
3432	1	Politologist explains Macron's desire to conduct independent dialogue with Russia
3432	3	"Paris and Washington have different interests in relations with Russia. This was explained by Lente.ru the desire of the President of France Emmanuel Macron to conduct an independent dialogue with Moscow by the head of the Franco-Russian Analytical Center ""Observo"", the expert club ""Valdai"" Arno Dubien."
3432	5	Politologist recalled that in the summer of 2019, a week after the meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Breganson, Macron after the meeting with Putin pointed to the presence of different interests in Paris and its partners with respect to Moscow, having regard to Washington.
3432	7	Dubien noted that in the matters of establishing contacts with the Russian side, the French president may face dissatisfaction of countries such as Poland and Sweden, as well as the Baltic States. According to him, they can blame Macron that during the French presidency in the Council of the EU he speaks from himself, not from the face of the whole union.
3432	9	“This is the main contradiction of Macron’s eastern policy: on the one hand he does not think about France’s policy outside the EU framework, and on the other hand his constructive approach to Moscow will ‘destroy’, sometimes down to zero, in search of consensus with the EU countries hostile to Russia,” the expert concluded.
3432	11	In a speech in the European Parliament on January 19, Macron said that the European Union needs an independent dialogue with Moscow on collective security and weapons control without mediation by Washington. “I think the coordination between Europe and the United States is good, but it is absolutely necessary that the Europeans themselves conduct dialogue with Russia,” he said.
3433	1	Macron says it is necessary for an independent dialogue between Europe and Russia
3433	3	Europe needs an independent dialogue with Russia on collective security and weapons control without US mediation. This was stated by French President Emmanuel Macron in a speech in the European Parliament, the broadcast is available on the European Parliament's YouTube channel.
3433	5	“To be trusted in us, we need to conduct a demanding dialogue with Russia. And we are convinced of this by observing the dialogue that Russia and the United States are currently conducting. I think the coordination between Europe and the United States is good, but it is absolutely necessary that the Europeans themselves conduct dialogue with Russia,” he said.
3433	7	Earlier, Macron expressed regret for the EU refusal to negotiate with Russia. According to the policy, Paris and Berlin a few months ago proposed to resume negotiations with Moscow, but did not receive the support of the EU member states.
3433	9	The French president also called the deadline for the publication of the response of the EU to the proposals of Russia on security guarantees. European security proposals in the region will be published within the next few weeks. The President noted that EU proposals on strategic stability will be discussed within the NATO framework, and only then will become a topic for future diplomatic discussions.
3434	1	The American Conservative: The European Union needs to defend itself, not to rely on the US
3434	3	The delay or freezing of the Ukrainian crisis is extremely disadvantaged to the regular American taxpayer, says senior scientist at the Katon Institute, former special assistant of President Ronald Reagan Doug Bando. He wrote this in a column for the American Conservative. According to him, Europe should decide on its own defence issues without relying on the United States.
3434	5	“For many years, successful European allies have refused to take responsibility for their own defence, preferring to use America for free,” said RIA Novosti.
3434	7	He noted that European countries are unwanted to provide military assistance to Ukraine.
3434	9	“Not the Italians, nor the Spanish, nor anyone else in the west of the river Oder are interested in signing a contract with Ukraine, not to mention sending troops to protect it,” he said.
3435	1	“This is an act of terrorism.” Bastrichin to Putin about the bombing on the Crimean Bridge
3435	3	The Russian authorities qualified the bombing on the Crimean Bridge as a terrorist attack. “There is no doubt – this is a terrorist attack aimed at destroying the critically important civil infrastructure of the Russian Federation,” Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed with the report of the head of the Russian Central Committee Alexander Bastrichin.
3435	5	Bastrichin said at a meeting with Putin that what happened was “a act of terrorism.” This conclusion, he said, allows to make “all data of the initial phase of the investigation.”
3435	7	According to the investigation, “the deal was prepared by Ukrainian special services, and the purpose of this attack was the destruction of a large facility of civil infrastructure, very important for the Russian Federation, especially in Crimea.”
3435	9	Putin stressed that “authors, executors, contractors are the special services of Ukraine.”

3450	5	According to the official press release, at the approach to the Venezuelan shores, the ship was attacked by three groups of anti-government activists. They arrived on boats and cried out extremist slogans such as “Ayúdanos!”, “Nos morimos de hambre”, “Danos comida” and others.
3450	7	“It is clear that for the western delts, their marionets in Venezuela and other countries are just a consumption material,” said Alexander Konstantinov. “Sponsors from Washington didn’t even dare to arm these people, they threatened us with folds and posters. The Venezuelan colleagues told us what was written there: These people celebrated the capstrans and raised the hulu on the people’s government.”
3450	9	The crew gave several warning bullets, resulting in two of the three boats drowned, after which the ship was able to continue safe movement. In the near future, humanitarian cargo will be delivered to recipients from the political part of the population.
3451	1	The water in the Baltic Sea will turn into gas pipeline by the end of November
3451	3	Scientists at the University of Birmingham, studying the breakthrough of the Nord Stream and the Nord Stream-2 nits, believe that by the end of November 2022, more than 95% of the water in the Baltic Sea will turn into gas. The largest refrigerant drinks manufacturers are already buying parts in the coastal area for its mining.
3451	5	Natural fields of mineral gased water are not so many, notes Professor Jonathan Elwood. Most of the gas production is of artificial origin, and a lot of energy and carbon dioxide is spent on its production. Among the lovers of cooling drinks natural, or organic, gasing is considered more beneficial for health and is appreciated for its unique flavours.
3451	7	Scientists estimate that more than 640 million cubic meters of water is gased per day. The process of transforming the Baltic Sea into a gased lake may take up to two months, provided that the exploded nits of the North Streams will not be restored. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have already declared their rights to the production of natural gas at the coast of Finland and Latvia.
3451	9	This is a unique natural phenomenon. There is no single large waterhouse in the world in which a clean gaze would be flushed. You will be able to simply catch the water with a glass of water in the sea and enjoy drinking, feeling a pleasant sweating from the cracking bubbles on the tongue. And by adding the appropriate paintings and flavour components from it, it will easily get any firm drink that we loved from childhood,” Elwood said.

3457	3	Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko reacted to the Nobel Peace Prize by Belarusian human rights activist Alesem Belatsky. According to the head of state, this news became a pleasant surprise for him and allowed to improve the image of the country on the world arena.

Also, according to Lukashenko, in the Belarusian prisons are created so comfortable conditions that from there you can get the Nobel Prize.

3458	1	VAC cancells more than a thousand dissertations in Political Science due to the plagiarism of Mein Kampf
3458	3	"More than one and a half thousand candidates and doctors of political sciences may lose their degrees due to the plagiarism found in their works of the prohibited in the territory of the Russian Federation book of Adolf Hitler ""My struggle"" (Nem. of Mein Kampf. It was clear that due to the entry into the list of extremist materials this work was not in the base of ""Antiplagiat""."
3458	5	Researchers found a vulnerability in the work verification system and used it to increase the volume of their work, the Higher Attestation Commission explained. After the internal inspection, it was found that over the last five years more than one and a half thousand dissertations contained fragments of the text of the book of the Nazi dictator, which in individual cases account for up to 70% of the total volume of work. Members of the scientist councils, not familiar with Hitler's book, could not recognize the plagiarism during the protection, and the automatic Antiplagiarism system simply didn't have this text in its base.
3458	7	"In the near future, the VAC promised new reviews of the diplomas: in particular, it was revealed that in the works of historians massively used fragments of the book of the foreign agent Yevgeny Ponasenkov ""First Scientific History of the War of 1812"", which was also included in the list of extremist materials and banned from spreading and reading on the territory of the country."
3458	9	“I myself was present at two or three such defences,” says RAN academic Viktor Petrovsky. The tone of some of the findings that the candidates brought seemed confusing, but I searched on the internet, searched in the library, and found no such statements anywhere. Then it seemed that they were the original thoughts of the authors themselves about Jews and Jews, but as we now know, they just stole these ideas from other thinkers. Of course, such people cannot be given a degree, let them go to the army to serve as evreators.”
3459	1	In Donbass dissecreted the plans of the armed forces in the event of war
3459	3	The General Staff of Ukraine in its plans regarding the “war” with Russia expects the withdrawal and trauma of civilians with chemical weapons. This was stated on Friday, February 18, by the former assistant of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the public activist Alexei Selivanov.
3459	5	Selivanov has operational and tactical tasks and explanatory notes to the scenarios of the exercises that were conducted at different times by the Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The documents are marked with the graph “Secret”. It describes the scenario of the war between Russia and Ukraine.
3459	7	According to the published materials, the Ukrainian military assumes that the participation in the “invasion” will take not only parts of the Armed Forces, but also the border guards, the National Guard, the police, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and even the bands of “goodbats”, which, in essence, represent a group of Nazi accelerators. As opponents, in particular, the Corps of the People's Military of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR) was noted.
3459	9	"The West believed that the ""Russian-Ukrainian war"" should be the most bloody conflict since World War II. Selivanov adds that such statements are reflected in these documents."
3459	11	"At the same time, the former assistant of the head of the defense of Ukraine said, the Ukrainian side does not intend to defeat the army of Russia, the goal in this case is to cause the opponent ""sensitive losses"". The command of the Armed Forces will go to Poland, and the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky to Turkey, where the villa is ready for him."
3459	13	At the same time, according to the data indicated in the document, the troops of Ukraine will be completed by volunteers, while the military status is initially planned to be introduced on the territory of ten areas.
3459	15	At the same time, Selivanov notes, the armed forces are aware that a significant portion of the population of Ukraine will not support the country. In connection with this, the Ukrainian command has provided for emissions of 60 tons of chlorine in Kazachy Lapani and 20 tons in Očakova. It is actually a technological disaster.
3459	17	"Earlier, on February 17, the British defense ministry presented the route of the movement of Russian troops, which are supposed to invade the territory of Ukraine. At the same time, the ministry noted that the scheme was published ""in purely illustrative purposes"". The agency also believes that an attack of Russian troops and from the territory of Belarus is possible."
3459	19	Zelensky, in turn, said the statements on the dates of the alleged Russian invasion of Ukraine and the panic that is due to them are working against the Ukrainian side. According to him, such tension can last long.
3459	21	"In recent months, the US and NATO have accused Russia of preparing an attack on Ukraine and increasing its presence in Eastern Europe. In Moscow, they reject all claims, stressing that they move troops within their territories, and also remind that they are not involved in the intra-Ukrainian conflict. In particular, on February 12, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov in a conversation with U.S. Secretary Anthony Blinken said that the U.S. and its allies launched propaganda campaign on ""Russian aggression"" against Ukraine is pursuing provocative goals, thus encouraging the authorities in Kiev to sabotage the Minsk agreements."
346	1	Russian Foreign Ministry approves visa introduction for Ukrainians
346	4	The decision on the form of the response of Russia to the introduction of visas by Ukraine has not yet been adopted, “the question is whether to answer mirrors or not,” said Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Rudenko.
346	6	“We are discussing this issue with various agencies. Here we need to take into account the whole set of factors, including humanitarian. We do not want to complicate the lives of those Ukrainian citizens who want to leave the country or the zone of combat and move to Russia. For them then obtaining visas would be a very difficult process, especially in the current situation, when we have even no embassy in Kiev,” Rudenko said.
346	8	“We will look and take our steps, based on our own interests, not necessarily everything should be done in mirror,” he explained.
346	10	According to him, “the question is whether to answer mirrors or not – the decision is not taken.”
346	12	“That happens, not necessarily always symmetrically in diplomatic practice. There is asymmetry. Let’s admit that we have a visa regime with Georgia, and for the Russians Georgia does not apply a visa regime... Therefore this is in practice, and it should not necessarily be mirror. And the president spoke about why to shoot himself in the foot. It is good for us that people go to us, see what’s happening,” he recalled.
346	14	Asked which departments are involved in the discussion, he replied: “This is both the Consular Department of the Foreign Ministry, and the Border Service, the Foreign Ministry – those from whom the security of the country depends.”
346	16	According to Rudenko, the meeting of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky at the G20 summit in Indonesia in November is not planned.
346	18	“No, [the meeting of the presidents of the Russian Federation and Ukraine is not planned],” he said, answering the relevant question.
346	20	It was previously that the EU countries were unable to agree on the prohibition of issuing visas to the Russians, as many were opposed. Now the deadlines for issuing visas to the Russians may increase to six months due to the European Union’s abolition of the simplified regime, as well as the number of issued visas will be reduced.
346	22	On Friday, the Council of the European Union finally approved the previous decision on the full suspension of the simplified visa regime with Russia.

3461	1	“There is a standard depth.” Medvedev describes how partial mobilization is going through in the Russian Federation
3461	3	The partial mobilization in the Russian Federation does not go without cases of “standard disturbance,” the vice-president of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev said. He gave an interview with the Russian journalist Natana Friedrichson, published on her Telegram channel.
3461	5	“Mobilization goes as it can go in a country where it was not more than 80 years old. There is true patriotism, there is human emotions, there is standard depth. But the most important thing is that the country united to protect our people and the Fatherland. And this is the warrant of our unconditional victory,” Medvedev said.
3461	7	He also answered a number of other questions, commenting, in particular, on the explosion on the Crimean Bridge:
3461	9	The commander and executor of the crime is the failed state of Ukraine. It is a terrorist act and divergence committed by the criminal Kiev regime. There was no doubt, and there was no doubt. All reports and conclusions are made. The response of Russia to this crime can only be the direct destruction of the terrorists. As it is accepted in the world.

3461	19	He called it a “typical manifestation of behavioral economy.” The expert also pointed out that after some calming and reduction in the flow of expatriates from the Russian Federation, the situation with the flow of money from the banks normalized.

3461	23	As one of the options for this alternative, the protection of schools and kindergartens is provided.
3461	25	“Our bill, in addition to replacing the call, provides for replacement of service and mobilization. We offer an alternative to those who, for objective reasons, should not go to advanced, but suitable for health: to give them the opportunity to go through the necessary training and to benefit the state. This can be the protection of schools and kindergartens, the work as sanitary and younger medical staff.

This proposal is associated with the frequent lack of financial funds for the protection of schools and other educational organizations in municipal institutions,” the press service of the faction reports.
3462	1	Russia and the New World
3462	5	"A new world is born in our eyes. The military operation of Russia in Ukraine has opened a new era — and at once in three dimensions. And of course, in the fourth, in-Russian. Here begins a new period both in the ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system — but it is worth talking about it separately a little later.Russia restores its unity — the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its anti-natural outflow, is overcome. Yes, at a great price, yes, through the tragic events of the civil war, because now the brothers, divided by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting each other, but Ukraine as an anti-Russia will no longer be. Russia restores its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together—in all its collections of great Russians, Belarusians and little Russians. If we would give up this, allow the temporary division to stand up for a century, then we would not only betray the memory of the ancestors, but also be forgotten by our descendants - for allowing the breakdown of the Russian land.Vladimir Putin took on himself - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, decided not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia – for two key reasons. And the question of national security, i.e. the creation of an anti-Russia from Ukraine and a forpost to pressure the West on us, is only the second most important among them.The first would always remain a complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to humiliate with the existence of two states no longer one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up our history, agreeing with the crazy versions of that “only Ukraine is and is the real Russia”, or to crucify with the teeth, remembering the times when “we lost Ukraine”. To return Ukraine, i.e. to deploy it back to Russia, with every decade it would be more and more difficult – the re-coding, derusification of the Russians and adaptation against the Russians minor Russians-Ukrainians, would make turnover. And in the event of the establishment of the full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine, its return to Russia would become impossible – for it it would have to fight with the Atlantic Block. This does not mean that its state will be eliminated, but it will be restored, restored and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. In what boundaries, in what form will a union with Russia be established (through the OECD and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be resolved after a point in the history of Ukraine as an anti-Russia will be set. In any case, the period of the division of the Russian people ends.And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns the relations of Russia with the West. Even not Russia, but the Russian world, that is, the three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, speaking in the geopolitical plan as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage – the West sees the return of Russia to its historic borders in Europe. And he is deeply angry about this, though in the depth of his soul he must admit that the other thing could not be.Will someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow will give up Kiev? The Russians will forever be divided by the people. And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites try to overtake the control of the Anglo-Saxons over the euro integration and gather a single Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only through the unification of Germany, which occurred by the Russian good will (and not very intelligent). To go down after that on the Russian lands is not even the top of ungratefulness, but of geopolitical stupidity. There was no power in the West as a whole, and even more in Europe separately, to retain influence in its sphere, and even more to take Ukraine. To not understand this, it was necessary to be just geopolitical fools.Naturally, there was only one option: to bet on the further ruin of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But what he did not work should have become clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin’s Munich speech, even the fool could hear – Russia is returning.Today, the West is trying to punish Russia for it’s returned, for it’s not justified his plans to live on its behalf, it’s not allowed to expand the western space to the east. Struggling to punish us, the West believes that the relationship with him is vital to us. But it’s not so for a long time – the world has changed, and it’s well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No pressure on Russia will lead to anything. The losses from the outbreak of the confrontation will be from both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy — the German project of euro integration has no strategic meaning while preserving the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control of the Old World. Yes, it can’t be successful because Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is necessary for Europe and for another reason — if the United States goes to self-isolation (as a result of increased internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving. If now the Atlanticists are delighted that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western Block, then in Berlin and Paris they can't ignore that, losing the hope of autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That’s why self-thinking Europeans are now absolutely not interested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders – realizing that it will become a curtain for Europe. The century (exactly half a thousand years) of global leadership is over, but the various options for its future are still possible.Because the construction of a new world order – and this third dimension of current events – is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly clearly passing through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality – an operation in Ukraine is unable to unite against Russia no one except the West. Because the rest of the world is perfectly seen and understood – it is the conflict between Russia and the West, it is the response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, it is the return by Russia of its historical space and its place in the world.China and India, Latin America and Africa, Islamic peace and Southeast Asia – no one believes that the West is leading the world order and even more establishes the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West — it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered fully and ultimately ended. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or no) — but not under its conditions and not under its rules."
3463	1	Chechnya to build a 100% waste processing plant
3463	3	"In 2023 the project of 100% waste recycling will begin in Chechnya. For these purposes in the region will be built the factory ""Ecotechnopark"", the press service of the Republican Ministry of Construction and MCC said."
3463	5	In addition, within the framework of the implementation of the national project “Ecology” in Chechnya will be launched complexes for the sorting and recycling of solid communal waste in the cities of Gudarmes and Shali, as well as in the Achhoy-Martanovsky and Nadeteric districts. The total capacity will be up to 470 thousand. Cube meters, IA writes “Chechnya Today”.
3463	7	As part of the same national project, 7,000 special waste containers will be installed in the Republic by the end of 2022. They will collect glass, plastic, metal, paper for further processing, as well as food, plant and polluted waste.
3463	9	Previously it was that Chechnya was among the six regions, where the project “Complex System for the Treatment of Solid Municipal Waste” will be implemented in the pilot mode. By 2024, eight waste sorting complexes will be built in the region, which will be able to recycl a total of 560 thousand per year. Tons of solid municipal waste.
3464	1	Author Newsweek Koul: Russia has turned the “big victory” of the West in the United Nations into a big failure
3464	3	"The Western countries believed they had a ""great victory"" over Russia in the United Nations, but they mistaken. Brendan Coul wrote about this in a report for Newsweek."
3464	5	“The Mart voting at the UN General Assembly, condemning the actions of Russia in Ukraine, could have been “predicted by the Western diplomats as a great victory,” but it only masked a very big failure in terms of explaining the Western position,” said Jonathan Eyal, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute’s analytical center.
3464	7	According to the author of the publication, the United States and its Western allies have long been exploring possible options for Russia’s exclusion from the G20, but it is practically impossible to do so, as Indonesia is taking the summit, and India, Brazil, South Africa and China do not want to support the appropriate decision.
3464	9	Earlier, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky expressed hope that the Russian Federation will be excluded from the “G20”, as it has suspended its participation in the grain deal.
3464	11	Before that, Canadian Vice-President Christina Freeland called for the exclusion of Russia from the IMF and the G20, but recognised that Ottawa can do little for it.
3464	13	On October 6, a member of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Jabarov, said that Russia will see any attempts to exclude the country from the G20 and will cross them.
3465	1	A woman was killed in the shooting of the Petrovsky district of Donetsk by the Armed Forces
3465	5	The woman was killed in a shooting by the Ukrainian troops of the Petrovsky district of Donetsk, the headquarters of territorial defense of the DPR said.“VFU (Armed Forces of Ukraine) shot the Petrovsky district of Donetsk, a woman died on the street of Baikalskaya,” the ministry said in a message in its Telegram channel.Petrovsky district of Donetsk is located on the western edge of the capital of the DPR, which is the most remote part of the city from the center. Since 2014, when the DPR declared independence from Kiev, this area, starting from the contact line behind the city of Marynka, is regularly subjected to attacks by Ukrainian forces.
3466	3	Every day civilians are protected by the Russian military.
3466	5	Special mission at special purpose units. It is the elite of the Russian Armed Forces. Universal soldiers, so they are called. And today, in their professional holiday, many specialists are in advance. They perform the most difficult tasks, for which it is necessary to act lightly and remain invisible to the enemy.
3466	7	Military officer of the Central Military District Special Destination: “We go from the back, from the positions that are least protected, we conduct the intelligence of the positions. We go into small groups (2-3 people), as a dozor, we can say, we remove the patrol from the silent weapon, the snipers cover us our own.”
3466	9	And this is what our artillery operates using powerful D-30 caves. On the images from the drone you see how the enemy column tries to escape from the fire. But the radicals did not do anything. Russian fighters destroyed five enemy tanks and about half a hundred nationalists.
3466	11	And about our courageous fighters, participants of the special operation. Here are the names of the new heroes.
3466	13	In the course of the liberation of the settlement from the Ukrainian nationalists, Arshalouis Dalakyan liquidated five militants who prepared the defence border. He also saved the lives of several wounded companions and brought them out of the battlefield.
3466	15	Senior Sergeant Vadim Ibrahimov from the artillery weapon hit two tanks of nationalists who tried to break our defense, as well as the support point of the Armed Forces.
3466	17	The artillery division under the command of Major Daniel Abramov destroyed the column of the enemy. The attack of the militants was broken down.
3466	19	Sergeant Alexander Bondarenko found a group of dissenters and attacked them. The nationalists suffered losses and resigned.
3467	1	Police shoot a child hospital in Donetsk
3467	3	The armed forces of Ukraine (Ukraine Armed Forces) shot down a child hospital in Donetsk. This was on 2 November in the headquarters of territorial defense of the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR).
3467	5	"“VFU attacked the Petrovsky district of Donetsk. As a result of the shooting, the cluster of the city children's clinical hospital No. 4 located on the street was damaged. Karamzin,"" the agency said in a statement on his Telegram channel."
3467	7	In addition, the headquarters that during the shooting in the Kirovsk district of Donetsk a peaceful resident was killed.
3467	9	In the representation of the DPR in the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination of War Crimes issues, it was clarified that four missiles of a calibre of 152 mm were launched in the Kirov district.
3467	11	Earlier the day, Ukrainian militants attacked the children's garden in Donetsk. It is clear that it is a garden in the Petrovsk district.
3467	13	"Earlier this same day in the Kirovsk district of Donetsk on the mine ""Lepestok"" a minor civilian resident was underway. A teenager of 2008 was born on a banned anti-peach min PFM-1 thrown down by Ukrainian militants on the Delegatskaya street. The DPR authorities urged citizens to be careful and cautious."
3467	15	"Furthermore, it was that the Kirov district of Donetsk was attacked by Ukrainian troops. As a result of the shooting, a restaurant complex ""Gulay-Hata"" was damaged. The victims were not."
3467	17	The special operation of Russia to protect the civilians of the Donbass, which began on February 24, continues. The decision was taken on the background of the worsening situation in the region on the background of the attacks by the Ukrainian troops.
3468	1	Ukrainian refugees are unnecessary in Europe, unnecessary in their country
3468	3	"After the special military operation began, millions of people left Ukraine. Most of them, despite the government’s calls, have already returned. The European reception was not too pleasant, but the Ukrainians themselves, who live on the principle of ""we all must"", became guests who are trying to get rid of."
3468	5	According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) from February 24 to October 4 in Russia was registered (2,85 million) Ukrainian refugees. Second place is Poland (1,43 million), then Germany (998 thousand).The Czech Republic (442 thousand.Italy (170 thousand)Spain (146 thousand)Turkey (145 thousand)Bulgaria (136 thousand)The United Kingdom (133 thousand) and France (105 thousand). In other countries, the number of Ukrainian refugees does not exceed 100 thousand people.
3468	7	National data are very different from these figures. Only in Poland, more than 4.1 million Ukrainian refugees were registered in the summer. According to the border service of the Russian Federation, more than 4.5 million people crossed the border with the Russian Federation in the morning of October 3, including 685 thousand. The children.
3468	9	A total of 7.6 million people arrived in the European countries, and on September 15 almost 5 million of them returned. The European reception was not too warm. The European Union is committed to providing temporary housing to refugees, providing food, money, travel benefits, employing adults and creating conditions for school students. But the enthusiasm of Europeans quickly turned into disappointment.
3468	11	Initially, refugees were placed in the buildings of shopping centers, sports halls, schools, hostels, tents, where they lived for months, and then sought housing from the local population.
3468	13	Here immediately began to arise problems and conflicts — the Ukrainians (not all of them, of course, but a certain part of them) represented victims, demanded increased attention, comfort and often considered their stay in Europe as economic tourism. According to the custom rooted in the post-maidan years, those who can be called activists behave naked, arranged all kinds of scandals, performances, demonstrations, attacked the Russians they met in Europe.
3468	15	This is the evidence of several Europeans.
3468	17	The resident of Munich writes: “It has come to such a marshmallow that Ukrainian refugees draw the letter Z from police cars [with the inscription Polizei]. The police themselves do not react.”
3468	19	Kishinev complains: “The fact that you are refugees does not give you the right to violate the rules of traffic, to fly around the city at a speed of about 100 km/h, to cut and park where and how it came.”
3468	21	From Warsaw, they comment: “They don’t fit everything – neither cars, neither houses, nor the city. I propose to take them to Warsaw, and they say they get to Berlin. People are trying to help you – appreciate it.”
3468	23	"The inhabitants of Poznań wrote a letter: ""Polish people are not obliged to provide them (to refugees - aut.) Super Conditions and Service. Now there are a lot of complaints from the Poles that the Ukrainians come, turn the nose, for example, that the kitchen is common for two rooms, and they go."
3468	25	British citizen Tanya Fox hosted two Ukrainian refugees in her home and helped them form a grant. Then women began to ask her to buy expensive cosmetics, did not clean in their room, the mother did not prepare for the child even butterboards. They ate in a cafe. The English girl breathed with relief when the guests left after a month and a half.
3468	27	Another family from the UK went to court for two months, as the Ukrainian woman they hosted wrote a statement to the police, accusing them of having forced her to wash the dishes and clean them in their room.
3468	29	The British government has promised that every family that hosts Ukrainian refugees will receive £350 a month for compensation. Due to the rise in prices for electricity, gas and heating, this money is not enough even for these expenses – the Ukrainians began to expose on the street.
3468	31	In Scotland, more than 2,000 Ukrainian refugees have been placed on cruise vessels, but in winter it will be impossible to live there.
3468	33	Ireland’s child and youth minister Roderick O’Gorman asked Ukrainian refugees not to enter Ireland due to displacement problems.
3468	35	In the Netherlands city of Ter-Apel, 700 Ukrainian citizens spent three days in the night before the closure of the refugee reception center because of the lack of places.
3468	37	A Czech refugee complains that “Czech children often expel our children from the children’s places because they speak Ukrainian” and it’s very difficult to rent a home because the Czechs don’t want to give it to the Ukrainians.
3468	39	In Poland, refugees will be forced to pay 50% of their housing and will be deprived of social resources after 30 days of absence in the country. In October, inspections have already been carried out and 80,000 people who have left Ukraine for more than a month have lost their grants.
3468	41	In Germany, 12 of the 16 federal lands said they were no longer able to accept and place Ukrainians.
3468	43	In some countries there are no government programs for refugees. In Turkey, only volunteers are helping them, and in October, from 400,000 people, only 40,000 remained.
3468	45	And what about the United States, with whose submission and was committed the “hospire revolt”, which launched a civil war on Ukraine? And they are now all the way away from the Ukrainians. President Biden has promised to accept hundreds of thousands of people, but in fact it’s different. The UNITING FOR Ukraine program is in place. In order to obtain a two-year residence right in the United States, you need to have a sponsor with American citizenship, only he can apply for a refugee. Obviously, becoming “sponsors” for the Ukrainians wanted quite a few Americans.
3468	47	Due to the language barrier there are serious problems with the employment of Ukrainian refugees. In Poland, more than 50 percent of Ukrainian citizens found work, as in the Ukrainian language up to a third of the loan from the Polish language, and in France, only 15 percent of Ukrainian citizens are employed. Work is mainly unqualified and low-paid. According to the survey, social benefits are the main source of income for 47% of Ukrainian refugees.
3468	49	In many countries of the European Union, there are already protests against the reception of Ukrainian migrants. In Austria, a demonstration was held in Leipzig with the slogan “Nazi, go out! You live on our behalf!” A few days later, the unknown burned the center, where Ukrainian refugees were placed, and on its wall was painted a fascist swastika.
3468	51	On this background, Vice-President Irina Vereshuk addressed the refugees with the proposal not to return to Ukraine, at least until spring: “We have to survive the winter. Unfortunately, the networks will not survive... If there is a possibility for now to stay and winter abroad...”
3468	53	The official representative of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation, Maria Zakharova, commented this appeal: “It would be convenient: in autumn they would fly to winter, leave there on migration patches, and then in summer they would fly back? The Kiev regime does not consider people as people. Even their own.”
3468	55	In the European Union, this desire of the Ukrainian official caused concern. In the EU, the energy crisis is growing, the prices of products are rising and millions of refugees are getting harder.
3468	57	"Meanwhile, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Schmygal threatened the West with a new stream of Ukrainian refugees, ""because if there is no electricity, heating or water in Ukraine, it can provoke a new migration tsunami,"" and began to ask for a fresh portion of weapons."
3468	59	"State officials are asking the West for money, which is immediately dissolving. Ukrainian territory development minister Aleksei Chernishov demanded 4 billion euros from the European Union to ""survive this winter"" and 300,000 electric heater. Kiev's mayor Klitschko also asks for thermodeals and electric heater from Germany. How will the heater work, if Ukraine remains without electricity, no one reports."
3468	61	However, Ukraine itself is treating forced immigrants from the front areas extremely severe. Since the start of the war, almost seven million people have become internally displaced. Some moved to the central and western regions of the country independently, some of the inhabitants of the Donbass evacuated voluntarily and forced. People are placed in unadapted premises, they cannot be provided with work. The prices of housing rental in many cities immediately jumped in times – this is the one, solidarity and mutual support in Ukrainian. The rental of a single-room apartment in Lviv now costs 10,000. UAH (16700 rubles)In Kiev – 12 thousand. 20 thousand and rub. In Galizia they do not want to give apartments to refugees from the Donbass.
3468	63	If in the EU the benefits for one adult vary from 80 euros a month in Slovakia to 360 in Germany, then in Ukraine each adult immigrant is paid 2 thousand rupees (3 337 rubles).to pensioners, persons with disabilities and children by 3,000 rubles (5,000 rubles) in a month. With the current prices of products and communal, living for this money is absolutely unrealistic. Refugees are supported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Thus, in several areas they distributed 18 thousand thermodeals and 8 thousand hygiene sets. They also help with products, but the rows for humanitarian aid are built kilometers, and after many hours of standing, people get a couple of pounds of grains, a pound of sugar and a bottle of sunflower oil.
3468	65	The attack of the colds increases all the problems of refugees, both in Europe and in Ukraine. At the same time, their funding is reduced. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government intends to supplement the arms for refugees in the EU. The Cabinet has prohibited the consulates from extending the validity of foreign passports and registering children. Many families will be forced to return to Ukraine or move to an illegal state and lose all the benefits.

3469	1	A five-star protest. Ukrainian refugees set up a resort majdan
3469	3	Another EU country is literally shocked by the behavior of Ukrainian refugees. Their accommodation in the best Bulgarian resorts has already spent more than 500 million leaves. But instead of the elementary gratitude from the refugees only sound insistance, calls for protests, and even the resort majadans. And from the words unhappy guests from Ukraine have already moved to action.
3469	5	"There will be no continuation of the ""course novel"""
3469	7	"On 31 October, the programme of placing more than 11,5 thousand Ukrainian refugees in Bulgarian hotels on the Black Sea coast was completed. Experts did not exclude that there will be no continuation of this ""course novel"". And the Ukrainians were advised to collect their luggage and move to neighboring Romania, where the similar program of aid to Ukrainian citizens is valid until June 2023."
3469	9	But the Bulgarian government surprised its citizens. Money in punishment is always lacking. Saving for everything. Bulgaria, from once a well-being Balkan state, has long become one of the poorest countries in the EU. The light at the end of the tunnel is still unseen.
3469	11	Large amounts for refugees
3469	13	But for Ukrainian refugees in the state budget of Bulgaria hundreds of millions of leaves are somewhere all the time. Moreover, the government publicly acknowledges that it is a serious amount. “The funds that the state allocates are serious. Even on the background of the other EU Member States, approximately 523 million leaves are still allocated. Of these, 200 million are money from our budget. And another 300 million are allocated by European programs and funds,” Bulgarian Minister of Tourism Ilyn Dimitrov said.
3469	15	All on the base
3469	17	Moreover, in order not to rage the Ukrainians, the Bulgarian government quickly (day to day) on October 31 decided to extend the support program. “The help will continue. Refugees are placed on state bases. We provided the necessary places. In a 15-day period until the middle of the month, the people who are now placed in the hotels will be moved to the appropriate state bases for this,” Bulgarian Interior Minister Ivan Demerjiev celebrated after the government meeting was completed.
3469	19	The Ukrainians would be happy. They did not begin to be thrown out, they did not begin to be deported, they did not clearly understand that their presence, gently speaking, was not pleased. But not. Refugees are unhappy. In the manner to which all Europe has already begun to get used to, they have begun to demand and openly rush to cruelty.
3469	21	Requirements of refugees – good internet, shops and pharmacies
3469	23	The Bulgarian newspaper Labour gave a word to Ukrainian refugees. The bases they want to send us to are old. It is very uncomfortable there. We need good internet, shops, pharmacies,” Lydia asks. “Our children are learning on a distance in Ukrainian schools. We need computers. It needs to be quiet,” Anna added. “We have a baggage collected. But there is no clarity,” Anastasia said.
3469	25	No one wants to leave the resorts.
3469	27	Journalists from the “Trab” tried to get into the situation of refugees. “For some of the Ukrainians (who were previously placed on state bases) the memories from these camps continue to be shocking. In one of the Black Sea hotels, about 200 refugees spent a sleepless night today. They don’t know when they will be transported, how they will be transported and where they will be sent. No one of them wants to move to the state bases proposed by the government of Bulgaria,” the newspaper writes in its report from the Black Sea coast.
3469	29	"But on the evening of 31 October, the refugees began to demonstrate that one sympathy was little for them. In the central Bulgarian media among top news appeared notes about the first mass protests of Ukrainians in the center of the ""Sunny Coast"". To say, it is one of the best Black Sea resorts in Bulgaria, where vacation is not a cheap pleasure."
3469	31	The hostels are ready to join the protesters
3469	33	And, it seems, the Ukrainians are ready to join the hosts of hotels in which refugees lived. I was not paid for April and May. Some money was partially transferred to other months. The thing is that there is no communication between us and the state,” said one of the hotels Veselin Danov. “We have no official information whether they will pay us for these people. We have some relationship with them. We live like a big family. And we can’t drive them out to the street,” the hotel’s other owner, Kirill Zašev, added.
3469	35	Ukrainians are preparing new protests
3469	37	Meanwhile, the newspaper “Trud” reports that the Ukrainians are preparing new protests and demanding “clearness.” The tourist season on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria has ended. There is almost no resting on the Sunshine Coast. So the Ukrainians can enjoy playing in their maidan on the empty streets of the resort.
3469	39	And yet the Bulgarians obviously don’t like when ungrateful foreigners begin to roll out their hands. They lack warmth and comfort now due to the prices of energy and heating that jumped up to heaven. Yes, and the good free internet and computers for their children they would not give up either. But the EU does not rush for help. They are not Ukrainians.
3469	41	I'm tired of the Kiev Majdan.
3469	43	But this is what the simple citizens of Bulgaria think about the demands of Ukrainian refugees. “All my acquaintances are shocked by these refugees. We have so many problems in Bulgaria because of Ukraine, and here these guys are unhappy that their resort season ends on a foreign account. This would be someone who paid me for a monthly holiday on the Black Sea coast, — told me one of my acquainted Bulgarian journalists, who, indeed, very much asked not to name his name, because he was afraid of the consequences because of the conversation with a Russian colleague. Instead of saying thanks, they still demand and threaten with protests. The Kiev Majdan seemed to be bored. This is not Ukraine. It is time for them to explain it.”
347	1	Borrell: Europe will not be frozen to die in winter because of the hot summer
347	3	"""Europe will not be frozen to die in the winter because of the cuts in Russian gas supplies, as the hot summer has just ended,"" said EU diplomatic chief Joseph Borrel, speaking at the interparliamentary conference on foreign policy and security in Prague."
347	5	“Europe will not be frozen to die, we had the hotest summer. Therefore, it’s not about freezing,” he commented on the words of the Hungarian parliament, accusing the EU that because of anti-Russia sanctions, Europe could “freeze to death.”
347	7	He also stressed that the EU needs to get rid of the dependence on Russian energy resources, no matter what it costs. “It’s hard, but it has to be done,” Borrell told RIA News.
347	9	"According to the head of the European diplomacy, the threat of freezing is ""the least concerned with Hungary."" “Specially in Hungary, which is also not at risk of freezing, since the Hungarian government on a bilateral basis agreed with Russia on gas supplies, so no one will freeze to die in Hungary,” Borrel said."
347	11	However, he admitted that problems could arise “in other parts of Europe”. “This can happen in other parts of Europe where there will be problems with gas supplies, especially in the industry,” Borrell added.
347	13	Meanwhile, the European diplomat acknowledged that EU citizens are tired of sanctions against Russia.
347	15	“We cannot give Russia the opportunity to exploit the fatigue of the sanctions that our countries are experiencing. This strength testing will continue. We must talk to our citizens and explain how our responsibility looks in the circumstances of the current crisis (in Ukraine). “We should also emphasize the importance of efforts to eliminate our strategic energy dependence on Russia,” Borrel said.
3470	1	Unhuman factor: Ukrainian refugees scatter the EU
3470	3	Socialists and political scientists say Europeans hate “yellow-blue”
3470	5	The European Union has exhausted all opportunities to accept Ukrainian refugees. They all go and go. Now - supposedly because of the threat of blackheads caused by Russian high-precision attacks.
3470	7	In fact, the Ukrainians rush in Europe in the hope of a harsh social and favourable jobs. And the reason to escape to heart-borne Germany or Norway is not important.
3470	9	Acceptance centers for Ukrainian refugees in Germany
3470	11	European politicians finally realized that their policy of “open doors” for Ukrainian refugees will soon become a catastrophe. After all, one thing is to support Ukraine by words and even by money (paying for NATO arms supplies). And a whole other thing is to resist the pressure of the continuing migration flow.
3470	13	And in the coming weeks in the European Union awaits a new wave of Ukrainian refugees, who are supposed to flee from the high-precision Russian strikes. And in fact, for the darm social aid promised by German Minister of the Interior, Nancy Father.
3470	15	Fezer is a social-democrat, and is very freely concerned with state benefits. On October 11, during a meeting with representatives of the federal land and local self-government, the minister announced: Berlin will give more money to the municipalities to accept even more refugees.
3470	17	The aid will consist in increasing the number of quotas provided by the federal agencies, — just 68,000 jobs (to date, 64,000 jobs are guaranteed in 300 federal enterprises and institutions).
3470	19	Fezer was forced to meet with the mayor and bourgeois who are striking in the shore because of the situation in numerous refugee reception centers. They are overfilled with Ukrainians, and accepting an additional number of migrants is simply unrealistic. Because of this, the municipalities are forced to rent additional premises - sports rooms, for example.
3470	21	How will they live with the cold?The!
3470	23	Only 70,000 Ukrainians have moved to Berlin, they live in full state satisfaction
3470	25	Since the start of the special operation, 11,5 million people have left Ukraine in the western direction, the UN High Commissioner’s Office for Refugees reports. Of these, almost 7 million passed through Poland, 1.6 million passed through Hungary and 1.4 million passed through Romania.
3470	27	It must be understood that in these Eastern European countries the Ukrainians have not remained. The majority moved further, including to the heart-borne to the refugees Germany. And the number of persons seeking to move to Germany has not decreased: since the beginning of the year, 135 thousand asylum applications have been submitted to the Federal Administration for Migration and Refugees (BAMF). Only in September, there were 19 thousand.
3470	29	Of course, such requests are submitted not only by Ukrainians, but also by residents of other countries (mainly the Middle East: Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan).
3470	31	However, the lion’s share lies just on the outgoers from Ukraine. Thus, they have even mitigated the immigration legislation, which the European Commission has strengthened in 2015. Then, let’s remember, on the background of the civil wars in Syria and Libya, the European countries have caught an unprecedented flow of refugees.
3470	33	Now almost 1 million. The Ukrainians were excluded from the difficult and long-term asylum provision procedure. In fact, they are fully equal in rights with citizens of Germany, France or Sweden. Most of the Ukrainian refugees live in sheltered apartments.
3470	35	Only 70,000 Ukrainians arrived in Berlin. And all of them the state provided housing, jobs, social guarantees. There are free integration courses.
3470	37	We had to increase the state of the German Migration Service BAMF (only three times!). Berlin has allocated 2 billion dollars to the municipalities. Social assistance to Ukrainian refugees.
3470	39	OSW: Only 17% of Germany’s residents would like to see Ukrainians in their homes
3470	41	The Ukrainian migration wave has covered the whole European policy and economy. The economy of the European Union, with the anti-Russian sanctions of the shooting himself in the foot, is trembling. And there are billions of dollars to be spent on the help of refugees.
3470	43	And in the conditions of economic stagnation, there is no place to get jobs for migrants — the Germans or the Spanish themselves would have enough. Poland is already suffering from Ukrainian invasion, which has been so loyal to Kiev recently.
3470	45	Polish global security expert Camille Freymark from the Center for Eastern Studies (Ośrodek Studiów Wschodnich) cites such data. In March, 58% of the residents of Germany were ready to become volunteers for Ukrainian refugees, and 27% were ready to take refugees at their home (true, only temporarily).
3470	47	Now, only 47% of the surveyed Germans are volunteers, and in their home the Ukrainians would like to see not more than 17% of the residents of Germany. On this background, the popularity of opposition parties has grown sharply, including “Alternatives for Germany”. It offers healthy things: the state must help first its citizens, and in the second, refugees.
