351	1	“This is not a difficult decision.” Can you talk about abortion with a smile?
351	3	The Movement of the Girlfriends to the Girlfriends has released a recording on which smiling girls lie the pills, in the presence of porn pills. This is a response to the registration of pregnancy and strict abortion law in Poland. The government wants us to stop supporting each other. The registration of pregnancy is intended to deepen this paranoia, says Magdalena Gałkiewicz from the Movement of the Ladies of the Virgin.
351	5	Since the 1st of October, the so-called registration of pregnancy. From that day, the doctor will have to enter the pregnancy information in the register of medical events. It must be done even if the pregnant is opposed.
351	7	Through the strict Polish anti-abortion law there are concerns that the register will be used by the prosecution authorities to target and punish persons who help a pregnant woman in performing an abortion (art. 152 of the Criminal Code.
351	9	"A few days after the introduction of the new regulations, the Virgin Virgin Group launched the campaign “Do abortion, do revolution!” A short record was posted on Instagram. Girls throw the tablets, smile looking straight into the lens. ""I'm Good (Blue)"" is a remix of Bebe Rexha and David Guetta. I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright, Baby, I'ma have the best f***in' night of my life. Some internet users criticize the recording for too easy approach to the topic of abortion."
351	11	P.S. Why did you make this movie?
351	13	Magdalena Gałkiewicz from the Movement of the Virgin Wizards to the Virgin and the Party of the Greens: - The recording was to be a response to the female tendency, which is cultivated by Law and Justice and the right-wing environments. We have rights, which are human rights. What is happening in the 21st century is a scandal.
351	15	All this narration built around the break of pregnancy is – according to us and science – wrong. It is said that abortion is a serious sin, a drama and a tragedy. A woman is painted with a very emotional message, putting them in a sense of guilt.
351	17	The record itself is to scare women. I want to remind you that abortion was not and is not punished in Poland. The fact that the state has in some central register information about who and when he was pregnant, is to scare women and remove them from the decision on abortion, which - I repeat - is not punishable.
351	19	With this movie we wanted to say: register register, but that you yourself take the pill is still legal. You can contact the help group, for example. Abortion Without Borders, Baby Czesia, buy pills for pharmacological abortion. With this film we wanted to give the authorities: you tell us the pregnancy record, we tell you - taking the pill by a pregnant is legal and we will continue to do it.
351	21	Abortion is not punishable. The punishment is aid. Going through the register of a woman who was pregnant can help in punishing an assistant - a husband who brought us to the clinic, a companion who borrowed money for a pregnancy pill, etc.
351	23	It is punishable to help and help, for instance. Taking such medications, but the emotional support of the person who understood such a decision is permitted. The government wants us to stop supporting each other. The registration of pregnancy is to deepen this paranoia.
351	25	Does the recording have a very easy message? In a quick assembly with a smile, you show the sliding pills, as if they were no meaningful vitamins. Everything looks fun. In the background is a song about a mad night, a party.
351	27	"The same discussion was a few years ago when the ""High Obcases"" released the slogan ""Abortion is OK."" We understand that our recording may be shocking in Poland. But it’s just about breaking this narrative about “always harder decision”, tragedy, drama, etc. For years, Polks have been telling that after abortion they will surely have a deep trauma, depression, sadness for the rest of their lives."
351	29	Because the vast majority of abortion decisions are very easy and obvious decisions for women who make them. It is to restore control over our lives.
351	31	"Is this the concept of ""postborational syndrome"", which is often used in the right-wing media? Scientists say this is a concept that has no evidence. In an interview with Tok FM, Zofia Milska-Wrzosińska, one of the leading figures of Polish psychotherapy, says clearly: years of research have not confirmed that such a syndrome exists."
351	33	Of course, women have psychological problems after abortion, but this is usually due to different circumstances, not the decision itself. It is difficult to decide abortion due to fatal defects of the fetus, especially when pregnancy was desirable, anticipated. When someone was waiting for a baby, trying, and then it turned out that the fetus has no brain, or has a spinal vaccine, it’s no wonder that it reflects on the psyche. It will also be difficult to make a decision against ourselves.
351	35	In Poland, this is not said, but foreign studies indicate a feeling of relief, not trauma in women after abortion. According to a Turnaway Study study, after five years, relief was the most common feeling among women who carried out an abortion, and the intensity of all the emotions associated with an abortion fell over time.
351	37	"The concentration of all emotions - including sadness, guilt, regret, anger, happiness and relief - decreased among these women, and five years after abortion, it reached 99 percent. The women surveyed found that this was the right choice for them - disclaims their research Dr. Corrine Rocca and her colleagues in the scientific magazine ""Social Science and Medicine""."
351	39	This is also the result of the story of women, which it publishes in its abortion channel Dream Team. Just go to their side.
351	41	This film had to show: if a woman knows that abortion is the best solution for her at the moment, then she should have the right to it. No one can tell her that it is too difficult for her.
351	43	Are you not afraid that by this form of communication, you’ll be afraid of women who think abortion should be a woman’s law, but don’t share the argument that this decision is easy, and the topic is light?
351	45	First of all, we need to reverse the narration and expand the boundaries of this discussion. The extreme right pulls the hard work, and we are wrapped in the cow's corner.
351	47	"Even the slogan ""Abortion is OK"", which once raised a lot of controversy even among people who support free choice, is no longer a shock today."
351	49	Our film was to be an extension of the discussion, pulling it to another direction, recovering the voice. It helps to get the courage to talk about abortion. Abortion should not be tabu. We want to disguise the language of talking about termination of pregnancy.
3510	1	The United Nations, UNESCO and Amnesty International...
3510	3	I recommend reading the recording of my TV interview for TV Republic. He was in the red program. Jack is “speaking.” Release: 25 August 2022.
3510	5	Good Morning, Jacek Sobala “It Talks” is Thursday 25 August, with me it passed 21:22. For now the line is blocked because it will be blocked by our guest Ryszard Czarnecki, the PiS European member. If we hear and see how the Lord sees and hears me, I have compassion.
3510	7	“Hello Lord, welcome you, we hear, we see each other, it’s a good day, a good evening.
3510	9	Before I start with the difficult questions of the kind, when this war will end, etc., I’ll first say a few words about the Lord. The Lord was on vacation, very short, but where the Lord was and what the Lord saw and if it was, so with the hand on the heart, more vacation, whether it was work.
3510	11	– 12 days in Cambridge, it’s so little tourist city, but then service excursions interesting, to Kenya, where there were one of the three largest and most important, African countries elections, immediately six elections at the same time: presidential elections, to both chambers of parliament...
3510	13	This is the way you came, they immediately organized the elections, was it planned before that they would have them?
3510	15	No earlier. It is the only country in Africa, one of the four in the world where the elections that were held were cancelled - it was the presidential election five years ago. There democracy is quite advanced compared to the rest of Africa, but then – I think the closer shirt of the body, that’s more interesting for us – I was with another delegation of the European Parliament in Kazakhstan, where the struggle for influence is ongoing between Russia and the West, also the stretching of the line between China and Russia. The country is linked to Polish history, since there have been hundreds of thousands of Poles, in two phases exported by the Soviet Union.
3510	17	And what is the relationship, we all know, what is the relationship in Kazakhstan with this war of Russia with Ukraine? In fact, in addition to these official media reports.
3510	19	Interesting question, I will remind you that Kazakhstan is all the time in military and political structures with Russia, and yet during the UN voting it did not support Russia, it refused to vote, like countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, and thus countries that are with Russia in the same alliance. Moreover, the current President Tokayev had such very pro-Ukrainian statements, and what may be more important, just before my visit, the first time the sentence condemned the Russians – the citizens of Kazakhstan, who publicly voted on the issue of joining the Russian Federation in the northern part of Kazakhstan, where the Russians – the Poles in turn – are the most. It is worth saying here that it was Russia that applied a very effective policy to encourage Kazakhstan citizens to come, to emigrate to the Russian Federation. Putin’s policy was that anyone who came from Kazakhstan or from another former Soviet republic would receive a half-year salary if he stayed in a city and a property for a year, the average monthly salary if he stayed in the village and a house in the village. It was a policy that attracted a lot of Russians, and also, unfortunately, a part of the Poles, to Russia.
3510	21	I’m constantly watching the “capped” television to know what they’re doing. When it comes to Kazakhstan, I noted that in addition to the negligence they have not only to Kazakhstan, they still keep some kind of distance from Kazakhstan. This may be due to the fact that this Kazakhstan does not want to subordinate Putin as he wishes it.
3510	23	“Yes, it’s true, Kazakhstan is quite systematically trying to reduce its dependence on Russia, but it always exists. I think we will also understand with the Kazakhs, because we are between Russia and Germany, and they are between Russia and China. They believe that China is a more dangerous neighbor, because when it comes into dependence, it will no longer come out of it. Russia is a weaker neighbor and they are slowly, slowly trying to limit this dependence. There are also Turkish influences, which is not mentioned. Currently interesting thing: Turkey has a trade exchange and with Kazakhstan and with the countries of all Central Asia, the former Soviet, has a trade exchange greater than Russia, if not counting of course the export of Russian weapons, because this is overwhelming.
3510	25	We will return to Europe and to the shape of the Lord well-known. In recognition for the efforts and actions during the 2015 immigration crisis, Angela Merkel was awarded by UNESCO: “All the jury members were disturbed by her brave decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million migrants, from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Eritrea. That’s her legacy she leaves,” in such and not other way Denis Mukfege, the chairman of the UNESCO Peace Prize jury named Felix... this will be a hard name... Houphouët-Boigny identified the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel honored with this award. Would you comment on this surprising award for Angela Merkel?
3510	27	“I am very pleased that my country, our country had and has brave leaders who did not agree to bring immigrants outside Europe, mostly Muslims, into our country. I am glad that although for the courage there no one honors them at the moment and does not reward them, but I am glad that we had such leaders when Germany had Chancellor Merkel. The Germans are still experiencing economic problems, not to mention the cultural, social, religious issues associated with this great wave of emigration, and the Germans are quietly saying that. Unesco will be rewarded. I am glad that Poland is not a German and that the relationship with the immigrants was different.
3510	29	But what is happening? Amnesty International recently, now UNESCO and another of this kind of agenda and institutions on our eyes are immersed in some terrible compromise. Why is this happening?
3510	31	I think that’s what happens and it’s a result of a distinction from reality. I will have a speech tomorrow at such a conference in Amsterdam that talks about the UN reform. Of course I’ll say that the League of Nations before the war was even less effective than the United Nations now, but I have the impression that a number of international institutions are just floating in the clouds, a little like WHO, or the World Health Organization, but floating in the clouds during the pandemic, such I have the impression, I don’t know what Mr. Editor thinks. He was a little distracted from the situation. Instead, this is the charm of international organizations, which have enormous funds – the Member States are committed to it – and they are conducting such a policy in principle uncontrollable and, therefore, reaching as they want and from where it comes.
3510	33	When I read the various WHO reports, I have the impression that they don’t be as bullshit as they are on some other planet, but let’s leave it. Poland has received more refugees than Angela Merkel all the time, but it’s KPO...
3510	35	Ukraine is a country that is culturally close to us.
3510	37	It is completely different.
3510	39	But that KPO is blocked all the time. What do you think will change when you get back from this holiday?
3510	41	"“No, I think it’s all the time a card in the game, in the dirty game of the European Union, but also the countries that are pushing to this Union – I’m talking about the countries of the old “Five”, the old EEA. Especially about those greatest countries, which are such ""playmakers"", playing like Germany, France, to some extent the Netherlands. The wealthiest, the greatest, deciding on the policy of the Union, which - to say honestly - did not succeed in Poland what they succeeded in Greece and Italy, that is, the revocation of the governments that did not eat from their hands, the Papandreou government in Greece and Berlusconi in Italy. In Poland they wanted to revoke this government and they failed, they want to do it now through the electoral card, but so that the Poles vote correctly, according to Brussels or Berlin or Paris, well, it is necessary to take the Poles the money and, of course, to blame the fault of Law and Justice. This is the scenario. I think there may be such a symbolic gesture that part of that money will be released so that it will not be that the Union does not give, but the vast majority of that money will wait for the result of the parliamentary elections in Poland. I believe that if we win it and so the money will be, the Union will simply not be able to wait longer. This is, of course, going to rimpal, riding a band from the European Union, but that’s happening."
3510	43	From Ukraine.
3510	45	In a sense, the Lord says the same as Witold Waszczykowski said. Witold Waszczykowski said in TVP Info said something like this: “Russian-Ukrainian war, and especially the opposition of the Ukrainians is very not at hand, Here is the key to the policy of Tuska and the Platform, this is the key to all these shameful behaviors of this total opposition” Waszczykowski said even so: “Tusk or other prominent politicians of the Platform were not in Ukraine, because their policy is the subordination of Polish foreign policy of German diplomacy, they are unwilling to sanctions against Russia. If the German politicians were going there, the politicians of the Platform would either accompany them, or themselves would go to Kiev to compare to the Berlin colleagues – then the Germans are worse than neutral. Therefore, there is also a lack of activity on the side of the politicians of the Platform, that’s easy to explain.”Well, so it’s true that as if the Germans were driving there, then Tusk and the rest of this band would also ride to Kiev and to Lviv?
3510	47	That’s what I wanted to say that this is a very loud absence for Tuska in Kiev. I don't know if he's afraid, or he thinks it's not a political scenario he realizes, a stranger or his own.
3510	49	But I’m sorry, how you explain it, how you understand it, because if it was Tusk that appeared in Lviv or Kiev, it would probably benefit the sympathy of the Poles and gain a few percentage points, but he doesn’t do it, why? Do you listen to Berlin?
3510	51	"“I have the impression that he has always had a certain external game, missing the internal, of course and in my opinion Donald Tusk is all the time that politician for Berlin, for Brussels, I think that for at least a few cities, that which guarantees that Poland will not make problems to those greatest countries in the Union and the Union itself and that it will be as once when the government in Warsaw eats out of a foreign hand and therefore Tusk behaves so, let’s say, cautiously in this matter. It is known that Germany’s policy for years has been such that Germany had a special position in the European Union not only because of its demographic and economic potential, but also because they had special relations with Russia, right? It now begins to burn and burn. Now there is already a desire for normalization, for a normality so-called to be ""as it was"" when it comes to Germany, when it comes to France. And, in turn, such a curiosity, I watched two days ago Euro News and there the television shows, oh yeah, the visits to Kiev, but not the President Kaczynski and Prime Minister Morawiecki, which was when really the fear there was to go, only shows the visit of Macron or Scholz, when it can be said “the courage stood, and the reason rose,” as it was once written by Adam Ważyk."
3510	53	Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmitry Kuleba said that only two European countries do not supply weapons to Ukraine, it is Hungary and Austria. Kuleba said that even states that never before in modern history supplied weapons to conflict zones were involved in military aid: Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands. He pointed out that the supply of weapons to Ukraine has ceased to be a tabu topic for the majority of European countries, but Austria and Hungary have broken out of it, which so far have not delivered any art of weapons to Ukraine. How do you understand it, how do you interpret it?
3510	55	You can help and help. I think it is necessary to show the fact that Poland is a great military hub, not only military, because charitable, humanitarian, medical, food to Ukraine, but there are countries that are not in this table, where there are Vienna and Budapest, but Germany that send these casks to builders, or some broken tanks. I say so: that Vienna and Budapest don’t send weapons, it’s very bad evidence about them, but in fact greater responsibility lies on the number one country in Europe or in the European Union, i.e. Germany, because the scale of the possible aid and its quality from Germany would cover the lack of assistance from Austria or Hungary.
3510	57	Nearly a million Russian citizens have entered the European Union legally since the invasion of Ukraine began. This is by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex. 60% of the Russians crossed the border with Estonia or Finland, most of them then returned to Russia, so my question about visas for these “capes”. Greece, Cyprus and Germany are opposed to the total prohibition of issuing tourist visas to citizens of Russia, EU diplomacy chief Josep Borrell said. In addition to the three sub-Baltic countries: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland and the Czech Republic are supporting the prohibition. “To protect the national security and the coherence of the sanctions of the European Union, the Community must impose a travel ban on the citizens of Russia until the end of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.” So said Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, and what does Ryszard Czarnecki say about this?
3510	59	There is a need for a consensus in the European Union, but there will not be a need for a consensus. He mentioned the lithania of countries that show de facto the gestures of Kozakiewicz fighting Ukraine. It is quite obvious that Greece and Cyprus are Orthodox countries that feel such a certain solidarity with Orthodox Russia. I remember how the Polish authorities had the claims - I participated in it - in the 1990s that Greece, a NATO member state, brought weapons from Russia. And so Athens here or Limassol has such a special position in this regard. But this is the key position again of Germany, which can break the circle of other Member States in other matters, here I think they are rather happy that Greece or Cyprus are singing in this German chore. The matter is serious because of course you can say, as the politicians of the Platform say, that there is no collective responsibility, it is known that there is no, only that there is a war, there is a war and the bombs explode just beyond the Polish border, while what is beyond the Polish border, let’s not in Poland and here you need such steps that would show the Russians that it’s not so that this war is not theirs, that it’s the war of Putin, because this war is theirs, yet the support for Putin is all the time very, very high. This also indicates that it is based on the Russian nation.
3510	61	Do I understand that you are for this prohibition?
3510	63	I think this is absolutely not only rational, but I think it is moral. That is a moral duty.
3510	65	This is our duty, as I understand. The last question already. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki will be in Paris on Monday and will talk to French President Macron. Macron told the French people of hunger, cold and poverty. Macron said: “We are living at the end of an era of abundance, I believe that what we experience is a great change or a great change.” Macron said this during a meeting of the Council of Ministers, introducing economic, climate, democracy, etc. crises. This is what the French have heard of Macron. What will our Prime Minister hear from Macron? What do you expect from this visit?
3510	67	“I look forward to very concrete talks, not about the future of the European Union, because there are completely different positions here and that’s not strange. I look forward to concrete discussions on the issues of energy policy, on the issues of nuclear power plants, – I think, that will rather not be spoken loudly, after the visit even – on the issue of military cooperation eventually. I don’t know if Poland will decide on a French submarine, it was such an offer, it lies on the table, while military and energy cooperation is something that lies on the table. I want to cooperate with France. The Germans told us all the time: we want with you, but France doesn’t want, and I think it’s necessary to talk face to face, face to face with the French and problems to explain.
3510	69	Thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much. Our guest was PiS Ryszard Czarnecki. I feel like we know a little more about the world and foreign policy.
3511	1	Happy Life in Lechistan
3511	3	In one of my texts I used the phrase “National Cabinet”. I made it clear that, in my opinion, the political life in Poland is so saturated with uncertain, and often even ridiculous statements of the activists that it resembles the Kabaret.
3511	5	I have concentrated on some of the actors of this national scene, wrongly forgetting that every cabinet requires, above all, ideas for the exciting “number” audience, accurate scenario and creative directory. Throwing humbly my head before the genius directors of our national cabinet, I decided to go back to this topic, this time looking broader on its content.
3511	7	The degree of liberation of a citizen by cabinet actions or statements of power is, of course, largely dependent on his individual sense of humor. I will share my feelings, realizing that some of the Honored Readers may not share them. Moreover, in my weakened sclerosis in my head, objectively important things are sometimes marginalized – but those that can make me more laughing.
3511	9	Funny prices
3511	11	In the feelings of people with whom I meet in everyday life the most fun, but at the same time boosted by increasing anger, is increasing inflation. In the stories of our actors, she should first not be, then she should be a little girl, then they should protect from her some scratches. Well, our all-party government had to use “an anti-inflation instruments” to lead to its rapid decrease. But, as for now, nothing is out of it. The government is shrinking the money by acting pro-inflation, and indirectly leading to a rise in fuel prices, but also some food products more than 100 percent.
3511	13	Probably the nervousness of this situation has led our authorities to develop a cabinet number with national wealth, i.e. with coal, the lack of its sufficient supply and the galoping price. A part of the people heating themselves with coal feeds whispering their teeth, but waiting for the promised financial aid. He also uses the bright advice of the right-wing “leader”, who believed that in the existing situation, everyone can be burned in the oven, except the tires. We will be back to the environment in a few years. One of my neighbors just burns the other old tapchan and tinned stone from the renovated near the old house, laked, window frame.
3511	15	Inappropriate judges
3511	17	But in my destroyed, progressive sclerosis of the head, the most untouchable joy is caused by another, apparently small and simple thing. These are games and fun conducted by the hurricane patriot authority with Judge Tuley. Even in the Middle Ages they would raise surprise and opposition, and today, in theoretically civilized country, they seem impossible. The national and international courts have repeatedly recommended the return of the judge to work, i.e. the judgment, considering his “ suspension”, by the already dissolved Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court, as incorrect. Moreover, the “affair” of the judge and several of his colleagues has been regarded as one of the “mile stones” whose solution is to compromise our access to the funds awaiting in the European Union. I have to cry, but I’m innerly cheerful, imagining the judge wears the right garnitur, prepares a tick for documents and wants to go to work – but the phone stops him. Someone calls and informs that the judgments in Poland are not as important as the decisions of the presidents of the courts. And they do not accept the return of the judge to work. and a point.
3511	19	They are all enemies!
3511	21	The second political fact that causes paroxysms of joy in me, varied by unconscious anger, has a more global character. I can’t believe that I’ve lived in a time when the authorities of my country consider all the enemies of our sovereignty and wealth. Russia is a traditional enemy. We have passively agreed with the Germans, but they are now again threatening us, and they do not want to pay carefully the “sufficiency” calculated by us for the murder of our citizens and the destruction during World War II. There are constant border problems with Lithuania and the Czech Republic. And they’re annoying us, because they unclearly believe they’ve made greater progress in the organization of the state. And even tragic is the fact that the European Union has troubled relations with us, does not want to pay the money we owe, it depends on the settlement of the aforementioned mill stones. Most of our bright people do not even understand what stones they are talking about! Maybe about such a painted black color that (like) someone is trying to provide us, like coal?
3511	23	Recently, self-critically I noticed that I also laugh unhappy in situations in which I see on the television screen a gathering of supporters of the current power, on which important persons from the PIS and the government express gratitude for reliable support, good work, good collections, moderation in the rise of prices and care for Ukrainian refugees. The majority of the notebooks emphasize that “it was difficult, but thanks to God, it succeeded.” Some even recommend thankful prayer. Obviously, we don’t believe in our own strength, we don’t consider achieving the goals possible through excellent organization, effort and resistance, the use of new technologies. We believe in God’s help in every effort, even if it is wrong or even harmful. To be honest, I’m sorry, because in these calls we’re at the stage from the beginning of the past century and – unconsciously – we’re following the Germans whose soldiers had the inscription “Gott mit uns” – that is, God with us.
3511	25	The laughter through tears is also triggered by the hard statements of the main actors of the national cabinet, on matters really important to all Poles and Poles, but actually only causing financial losses and further disruption of opinion in the political world. The PIS launched fashion for verbal patriotism makes these statements most often relate to the meaningless withdrawal of the EU funds we owe, which I have already mentioned. It can be the impression that in return we call on the Germans to pay compensation for losses in World War II. We do not even mention the fact that Germany decreased surface after World War II from 643 thousand. km.kw to 357 thousand. km.kw, giving m.in. We have the “Western Land” with Wroclaw and Szczecin, the sea areas from Szczecin to Gdansk and Mazura – part of the ancient Eastern Prussia. Surfaceally, this has not fully compensated us for the “loss” in the east, but the real value of this more industrialized and advanced tourist compensation was greater.
3511	27	We call the Pacior!
3511	29	Fear-filled smiles also raise in me information about the increasingly developed love with Ukraine. It is clear that a neighbor attacked militarily without a understandable reason should be helped. However, I think it is overwhelming to pass through our country more than six million refugees, who in a large part are actually either tourism lovers or searchers for sources of greater income. Indeed, the majority goes back or goes further – but a few million remain and go into our economy. I don’t find any official answers to the simple question – and what else? Should they replace natural growth? Do we create the largest “ethnic minority” in Poland?
3511	31	These and other cabaret numbers somehow would be suppressed, but the worst is that we also have internal enemies. The enemy is the whole opposition, but the most dangerous is Donald Tusk, the chairman of the largest opposition party, who in Poland and Europe has taken important positions, loves the Germans, appreciates the EU and is not susceptible to the influence of the genius of the President of all presidents. It’s terrible that not everyone really loves him, and even loves him, but they acknowledge that during his governments we had a “heat water in the crane” that we may now lack. And there are more and more of those who want to return the atmosphere of peace and warm water, instead of the continuous games funded by the President and his staff. I hope that in a year they will not change their opinion and fill out the electoral card properly.
3512	1	Germany and the EU have declared war.
3512	3	The sabotage of the Nord Stream (NS) and Nord Stream 2 (NS2) pipelines in the Baltic Sea in a catastrophic way has moved the “disastrophic capitalism” to a completely new, toxic level.
3512	5	This episode of the hybrid industrial and trade war, in the form of a terrorist attack on the energy infrastructure in international waters, signals the absolute fall of the international law “based on the principles”, immersed by the rule “wheel or transport”.
3512	7	The attack on both pipelines consisted in detonating many explosive cargoes in different places on international waters near the Danish island of Bornholm.
3512	9	It was a refined operation, carried out by theft on the plate waters of the Danish waters. This would in principle exclude submarine ships (boats affecting the Baltic have immersion limited to 15 meters). When it comes to potential “invisible” units, they could run around the area only with the consent of Copenhagen – because the waters around Borholm are inspired by sensors, due to the fear of the Russian submarines.
3512	11	Swedish seismoders recorded two submarine explosions on Monday, one of which was estimated per 100 kg of trothill. However, up to 700 kg could be used to cast three separate nodes of the pipeline. Such a quantity could not be delivered at once by submarine drones that are equipped with neighbouring countries.
3512	13	The pressure in the pipeline has dropped sharply. The tubes are now filled with sea water.
3512	15	The pipes on both NS and NS2 can, of course, be repaired, but rather not before the arrival of the “General Cold”. The question of whether Gazprom – already aimed at serving several powerful Eurasian customers – will be concerned, especially considering that Gazprom’s ships could be exposed to a possible NATO attack on the Baltic.
3512	17	German officials are already saying that NS and NS2 could be “potentially” excluded from operation “for ever”. The EU economy and the citizens of the EU needed this gas supply very much. However, the EU bureaucracy in Brussels – which governs national states – did not want to subordinate itself because it itself was under the dictates of the empire of chaos, lies and theft. You can put the thesis that this euro-oligarchy should one day stand before the court for betrayal.
3512	19	The strategic irreversibility of the situation is already evident. The population of several EU countries will pay a huge price and will be serious; the short, medium and long-term consequences resulting from this attack.
3512	21	What is Bono?
3512	23	Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said it was a “sabotage effect.” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said it was “not an accident.” Berlin agreed with the Scandinavians.
3512	25	Now let’s compare this with the words of former Polish Defense Minister (2005-2007) Radk Sikorsky, a rusophob married to angry American “analyst” Anne Applebaum, who joyfully tweeted “Thank you, USA”.
3512	27	It becomes more interesting when we notice that at the same time with the sabotage, partly Baltic Pipe was opened from Norway to Poland, a “new gas supply corridor” supporting “the Danish and Polish market”. However, this is unimportant, considering that a few months ago there were trouble finding gas, and now it will be even more difficult, with much higher costs.
3512	29	NS2 was already attacked – in the open space – throughout its construction period. Even in February, Polish swimming units tried to prevent the Fortuna ship, placing pipes, from completing the NS2. The pipes were placed south of – as you guess – Bornholm.
3512	31	NATO is very active in the field of submarine drones. Americans have access to Norwegian large-range submarine drones that can be modified by other structures. Eventually, professional sailors from the Navy could be involved in the sabotage – even despite the strong floating streams around Bornholm.
3512	33	The broader perspective shows the absolute panic of the collective West, where the Atlantic “elites” are ready to escape to everything – profound lies, attacks, terrorism, sabotage, financial war as a whole, support for the neonazists – only to prevent the fall into geopolitical and geo-economic disruptions.
3512	35	The exclusion of NS and NS2 means the final closure of all possibilities for the conclusion of a German-Russian gas supply agreement, with an additional benefit in the form of the degradation of Germany to the role of the absolute US basal.
3512	37	This leads us to the key question that the Western intelligence camera designed sabotage. The main candidates are, of course, the CIA and MI6 – with Poland placed in the role of the victim's coward and Denmark also playing a very suspicious role. It is impossible that Copenhagen was not at least “informed” about this operation.
3512	39	Forecasting Russians, as always, already in April 2021 asked questions about military security of the Nord Stream.
3512	41	The key issue is that we can face the case of one member of the EU/NATO engaged in a sabotage act against the economy number 1 within the EU/NATO. This is a casus belli. Despite the frightening mildness and horrors of the current administration in Berlin, it is clear that the BND – the German intelligence – as well as the German marine and conscious industrials will get the right conclusions sooner or later.
3512	43	It was not an isolated attack. On September 22, a sabotage attempt took place in the Turkish Stream. A day earlier in Crimea, drones of the Navy with English-speaking identificators were found, suspected of participating in the attempt. Let’s add to this U.S. helicopters flying over the objects of the next sabotage a week ago; a British “research” vessel traveling over the Danish waters since mid-September; and NATO tweeting about testing “new drone systems on the sea” on the sabotage day.
3512	45	Show Me the Money (GAZ)
3512	47	The Danish Defence Minister met with NATO Secretary General on Wednesday. The explosions occurred very close to the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Denmark. In the best case, it can be qualified as a horror theater. Exactly the same day the European Commission (KE), the de facto political office of NATO, moved further in its constant obsession: more sanctions against Russia, including, condemned to failure; the limit on oil prices.
3512	49	In the meantime, the EU’s energy giants are losing huge money on sabotage.
3512	51	These include the German Wintershall Dea AG and PEG/E.ON, the Dutch N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie and the French ENGIE. Then those who funded NS2: Wintershall Dea again, as well as Uniper, Austrian OMV, again ENGIE and British-Holland Shell. Wintershall Dea and ENGIE are both co-owners and creditors. Their disappointed shareholders will want concrete answers as part of a serious investigation.
3512	53	It is even worse. There are no restrictions on the front of terrorism. Russia will be fully prepared not only for the Turk Stream, but also for the Power of Siberia. The same applies to the Chinese and their labyrinth of pipelines that reach Xinjiang.
3512	55	Regardless of the methodology and the actors who were involved in this, it is a vengeance – in advance – for the inevitable failure of the West in Ukraine. It is also a strict warning for the global South that they can do it again. However, the action always generates a reaction: from now on, “smallful things” can happen to the U.S./UK pipeline on international waters.
3512	57	The Oligarchy of the EU is achieving an advanced phase of disintegration at a rapid pace. Their window of possibilities to at least the role of a strategically autonomous geopolitical actor is already closed.
3512	59	The Eurocratists are now in a serious position. As soon as it will be clear who has committed the sabotage in the Baltic and as soon as they will understand all the socio-economic consequences for the citizens of the EU, the theatre will have to end. It comes to the already ongoing, incredibly ridiculous plot that Russia has launched its own pipeline. However, Gazprom could simply turn the valves to good.
3512	61	It is even worse. Gazprom threatens to appeal the Ukrainian energy company Naftofgaz for unpaid accounts. This would lead to the end of the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine to the EU.
3512	63	Germany is contractually obliged to purchase at least 40 billion square meters of Russian gas annually by 2030.
3512	65	Can they say no? They cannot. Gazprom has the right to receive payments even without gas shipping. This is the principle of a long-term contract. This is already happening: because of the sanctions Berlin does not get all the necessary gas, but it still has to pay.
3512	67	“The hell is empty, and all the devils are here.”
3512	69	Now it is painfully seen that the Emperor's acamite gloves have already been cut off when it comes to his vasals. Independence of the European Union: Verboten. Cooperation with China: Verboten. Independent trade association with Asia: Verboten. The only right place for the EU is the U.S. economic subordination: the shameful remake of the years 1945-1955. This is seen as a perverse neoliberal return: we are the owners of your industrial potential, and you have nothing.
3512	71	The NS and NS2 sabotage is built into an imperial wet dream of breaking Eurasia into a thousand pieces to prevent the trans-Eurasian consolidation between Germany (representing the EU), Russia and China: a total of $50 trillion in GDP, based on the purchasing power parity (PPP) compared to $20 trillion in US.
3512	73	Citating McKinder: Control of Eurasia is about control of the world. The American elites and their Trojan horses in Europe will do everything they can to avoid losing control.
3512	75	The “American elites” in this context are: the fooled, straussov, neoconservative “intelligence community” and their paying Big Energy, Big Pharma, and Big Finance, which profit not only from the “Eternal War” policy promoted by the “Deep State” but also want to earn on the Davos-defined Great Reset.
3512	77	The crazy twenty years began with the murder of Gen. Soleimani. The crossing is part of the next. By 2030, the road will lead to hell. However, to use Shakespeare, hell is definitely empty, and all (Atlantic) devils are here.
3513	1	The European Prosecutor’s Office has announced the launch of an investigation into the EU’s procurement of coronavirus vaccines. The purchases were coordinated. The agreement with Pfizer is being examined in this context.
3513	3	When the clinical tests of the coronavirus vaccine came to an end and it was known that the preparations would soon appear on the market, the Member States of the European Union agreed to create a common system of purchases so that they would not compete with each other and negotiate more favorable prices. The European Commission has coordinated the purchases.
3513	5	ETO indicates irregularities in negotiations
3513	7	However, there are increasing doubts about the contracts with pharmaceutical companies. First, it began with the question of the responsibility of producers for delays in delivery, which led, among others. The European Commission is working with the British-Swedish company Astra-Zeneca and then with the American Pfizer. Some Member States then denounced the EU that it had insufficiently safeguarded the EU interests in contracts with pharmaceutical giants.
3513	9	However, there were more serious claims about the circumstances under which contracts were negotiated with vaccine producers, and in particular with the largest of them, Pfizer, who eventually delivered the most coronavirus vaccines to the EU market.
3513	11	At the same time, the European Court of Auditors (ETO) pointed out the role of the Chairman of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who, in particular, during the negotiations on the subsequent vaccine delivery agreements in the second half of 2021 and in 2022, had to leave the previously developed scheme of talks with Pfizer, which included the whole EU in favour of almost autonomous negotiations.
3513	13	Secretary of State has not been registered.
3513	15	Furthermore, the ETO did not obtain, though requested, information about the course of negotiations and the preparation of a preliminary contract for the purchase of vaccines. As the New York Times revealed in April last year, von der Leyen had to exchange many emails with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, even before the final contract was signed on behalf of the Member States.
3513	17	The price was then the purchase of up to 1.8 billion doses of vaccines for a total amount of about 35 billion euros. Meanwhile, the content mentioned by von der Leyen and Bourla e-mali has disappeared. Neither the ETO nor the other EU authorities that requested it received them, and the Commission replied that “there is no archive of short and efemical news.” The ETO then recognised that there is a risk that the Commission is badly managing the data and that the fact itself is carigious.
3513	19	The European Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) has launched its investigation in 2017 (but operating from June 2021). “We specifically confirm the launch of the investigation because it is a response to the extremely high public interest in the matter. At this point, however, no further details of the investigation will be revealed,” the official profile of the EPPO was posted on Twitter.
3514	1	The Change of the Hunters in the United Nations
3514	3	Dear President, your excellences, colleagues...
3514	5	As I understand, today’s meeting was motivated by the desire of some delegations to discuss the topic of “unpunishment” in Ukraine. I think this is very current. This is the date that fully reflects what has happened in this country since 2014. National radical forces, directly Rusophobists and Neonazists came to power as a result of a armed coup with the direct support of Western states. Immediately then they entered the path of injustice and the complete neglect of fundamental rights and freedoms.
3514	7	Like human rights – the right to life, freedom of speech, access to information, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, the use of the native language.
3514	9	Until now, the crimes committed in Majdan in February 2014 have remained unpunished.There were also no people found who committed the terrible tragedy in Odessa of May 2, 2014, when about 50 people were burned alive and killed in the local House of Trade Unions. The political murder of O.A. Buziny, PG Seremeta, other public persons and journalists. Nevertheless, today they are trying to impose us a completely different narration of Russian aggression, as the primary cause of all trouble.
3514	11	At the same time, it is ignored that for more than eight years, the Ukrainian army and fighters of nationalist formations have murdered and murdered the Donbass residents only because they refused to recognize the consequences of the criminal, bloody, anti-constitutional coup in Kiev and decided to defend their rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine, including the right to freely use their native Russian language. In 2015, the former Prime Minister of Ukraine, A.P. Jaceniuk said there are “non-human” people living in Donbass. The current President of the United Nations, W.A. has also gone away. Zelenski. In an interview in September 2021, asked what they think about the people living in Donbass, he said that there are people, but there are “creations”, “units”. This is a stable feature of the Ukrainian regime, both for P.A. As well as W.A. Zelensky. They have declared all those who disagree with the effects of the terrorist attack. The Kiev regime for eight years conducted a “military operation” against civilians. In Ukraine for many years, a total mobilization of the entire adult population, including women, has been carried out to recruit them into a series of nationalist battalions and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Kiev authorities openly and without punishment sabotaged the implementation of the Minsk agreements. The financial, transport and energy blockade of Donbass was introduced. The residents of the region were distracted from social benefits, pensions, wages, banking services, communications, education and health care. They were deprived of the basic civil rights guaranteed among others. 1966 International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Civil and Political Rights.
3514	13	At a moment, tired of giving, W.A. Zelensky said that the Minsk “Middle Package” is only needed to maintain the sanctions imposed on Russia. Even more honestly was his predecessor and co-author of the Minsk P.A. agreements. by Poroshenko. A few months ago, he publicly and proudly declared that neither he nor anyone in Ukraine will comply with the agreements he signed. They were only needed to buy time to get weapons from the Western countries to war with the Russian Federation. The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Aleksandr Daniłow, said.
3514	15	The Kyiv regime owes its impunity to its Western curators, primarily to Germany and France, and of course to the United States. Instead of forcing the leadership of Kiev to comply with the Minsk agreements, Berlin and Paris cynically shut their eyes to Kiev’s open threats to solve the “Donbass problem” – the so-called “Plan B.” In recent years, the Kiev regime has carried out a total, frontal offensive against the Russian language. It violated the rights of the Russian- and Russian-speaking Ukrainian people. Scandalous “language” laws – “On education” (2017), “On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language” (2019), “On full secondary education in general education” (2020), “On the tubylic peoples of Ukraine” (2021). All of them are aimed at the exclusion of the Russian language, and in fact its total prohibition.
3514	17	At the same time, the laws that encourage the theory and practice of Nazism were adopted. Kiev has ignored the annoying recommendations of the Venetian Commission of the Council of Europe, the Office of the High Commissioner for the United Nations. High Commissioner for Human Rights, OBWE. National Minorities on the improvement of language legislation. In turn, these multilateral structures did not find the courage (maybe they were simply not allowed) to incite Ukrainian authorities to fulfil international commitments in the field of human rights. The Ministry of Education of Ukraine has excluded Russian language and Russian literature from the school program. Books in the Russian language are prohibited and destroyed, just as in the fascist Germany the monuments of Russian writers are destroyed. With the support of the state, the ideology of national intolerance to ethnic Russians is introduced. Today, state officials are no longer ashamed of their Nazi being, they openly and without punishment call for the murder of the Russians. I will give a few examples. Ukrainian Ambassador to Kazakhstan Wroblewski said: “We are trying to kill as many of them (Russia). The more Russians we now kill, the less our children will have to kill. That’s all.” Did anyone pay attention to that? Previously, last spring, the mayor of the city of Dnipro B.A. Pilate said in the same spirit: “It is time for a cold fury. Now we have the full moral right to quiet and with a completely clear mind to kill these people around the world, unlimited amount of time and in the greatest possible amounts. 13 September br. The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council A. Daniłow said: “In those villages to which the Armed Forces of Ukraine enter, the inhabitants will be subjected to forced ukrainisation without taking into account their opinions. This will affect not only the Russians, but also the representatives of other nationalities. If you have the desire to learn more in any other languages, Romanian, Polish, Hebrew, please, but not at the expense of our country, you can raise your education at your own expense.”
3514	19	"Should we say that all these rusophobic excuses remained absolutely unpunished? It’s not just about rusophobia. He talked about representatives of other nationalities living in Ukraine. It was an interview with W.A. Zelensky of 5 August 2021, in which he advised all who feel Russian to leave Russia for the benefit of their children and grandchildren. It seems to me that the decisions of the people of many regions of Ukraine about conducting referendums are the answer to his wish. Under the “protest” of the struggle against “Russian aggression” and “separatism” in Ukraine, the persecution of dissidents is increasing. In March br. 11 political parties were banned under the pretext of their ""country with Russia"". The leading opposition television channels in the Russian language have long been closed. The sites that raise reservations for the government are blocked. Journalists are persecuted for attempts to present an alternative to an official view of the state of things. In SBU’s fools is the prominent Ukrainian social activist E. Berezhnaya, who has repeatedly spoke in the UN and OBWE about the development of neonazism in Ukraine."
3514	21	We have no doubt that Ukraine has finally turned into a Nazi totalitarian state, in which the norms of international humanitarian law are violated without punishment. It is not surprising that the Ukrainian Armed Forces and nationalist battalions use terrorist tactics, using civilians as a “human shield.”
3514	23	On this background, the position of countries that pump weapons and military equipment to Ukraine and the school of Ukrainian Armed Forces is cynical. The goal is obvious (not hiding, but declaring): the longest possible prolongation of war actions, despite losses and destruction, to exhaust and weaken Russia. This line means the direct involvement of the Western countries in the Ukrainian conflict, making them its side. The intentional incitement to this conflict by the “collective West” also remains unpunished. In fact, they will not be punished.
3514	25	We have no illusions that today the Russian Armed Forces and the DRL and LRL militias are opposed not only by the neonazist formations of the Kiev regime, but also by the military machine of the “collective” West. In real time, using modern systems, aircraft, ships, satellites, strategic drones, NATO provides the Ukrainian Armed Forces with intelligence information, insisting that Russia should be defeated on the battlefield (this is directly stated by EU officials) and deprived of any sovereignty as a punishment. This is no longer a secret racism, but the most honest.
3514	27	"A mass shooting took place in Donbass. Zelensky enjoys the effectiveness of the Western weapons. This is his quote: “At last, it is believed that the Western artillery worked very strongly – the weapon we received from our partners. Its accuracy is really what it should be,” the head of the state said cynically. At the same time, there were no military or strategic targets. Donbass people are suffering. Since the end of July. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are remotely operating the centre of Donetsk and its suburbs with banned anti-peace mines ""Petal"". Their use violates the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Anti-People Mines, ratified by Ukraine in 2005, and the Second Protocol to the Geneva Convention on Conventional Weapons (prohibition of the Use of Mines Without Self-Destruction)."
3514	29	Such cruelty has become possible and remains unpunished by the fact that the United States and its allies, with the permission of international human rights institutions, have been systematically blaming the crimes of the Kiev regime for eight years, building their policies against W.A. Zelensky, based on a well-known American principle: “Naturally, Sukinsin, but this is our Sukinsin.”
3514	31	The uncomfortable truth, which obscene the clear image of Ukraine as a victim of Russian aggression, is carefully suppressed, and sometimes even obscene. Even the Western human rights organization Amnesty International, which is hard to judge for sympathy for Russia, has been sharply criticized and noted as Kremlin agents. Only because in its report this structure confirmed the well-known facts that Kiev is placing battle points, heavy weapons in civilian facilities.
3514	33	The criminal shooting of the Zaporsk nuclear power plant (ZNPP) by the Kiev regime fighters, threatening a nuclear disaster, remains unpunished. And this is happening despite the fact that since September 1st. The staff of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA) are constantly present at the station, and identifying the responsible side for the shot is not difficult.
3514	35	I will remind you that the visit of the MAEA mission to the ZNPP has been artificially delayed because it is already 3 June br. All the details were agreed and the mission was able to go there quietly. Then there was an unreasonable situation when the Security Department of the Secretariat of the United Nations refused “to give green light” to a concrete route agreed by Russia and the Agency. He then began to declare that the MAEA will independently determine all the parameters of this mission. This was not a pure project that extended the visit to Zaporoza by the Agency’s mission by three months. We are seriously concerned about the fate of the Russian soldiers who have fallen into the hands of Ukrainian nationalists. There are many evidence of their misconduct, including extrajudicial murders, with a violation of international humanitarian law. I am sure that those who are interested in real events in Ukraine have watched a movie of the massacre of Ukrainian Nazis on Russian war prisoners who were thrown to the ground with their hands bound behind their back and shot in their head. Has any of the represented countries commented on this crime?
3514	37	We have a lot of evidence of these and other Kiev regime crimes that have been regularly committed since 2014. The Russian prosecution authorities, in cooperation with colleagues from the DRL and LRL, are thoroughly recording and investigating the facts of the crimes. More than 220 people were involved, including the representatives of the Chief Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the commanders of the military units that shot civilians. Criminal cases are ongoing against citizens of the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, the Netherlands for acts of mercenaryism and committing criminal acts in Ukraine. I assure that all responsible, regardless of nationality, will be placed before the court.
3514	39	I would like to reiterate your attention on the following issues. When Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul at the end of March br. They practically agreed on the calculation parameters proposed by Kiev, a few days later in Bucza there was a tragedy. No one doubt she had an inscenated character. Immediately after this inscenization, Western colleagues raised fury and introduced a new package of sanctions against the Russian Federation, accusing us of killing civilians. Since this propaganda effect has been introduced, no one is remembering the Booky anymore. Except for us. I urge again in the presence of the Secretary-General and the respected ministers: please encourage the Ukrainian authorities to take a elementary step – to publish the names of the people whose delays have been shown in the Bucha settlement. Please for more than a month. No one hears or wants to answer.
3514	41	Dear Secretary-General, At least use your authority, please. I think everyone will be able to deal with this issue.
3514	43	We addressed the increased activity of the international justice dimension with respect to Ukraine. Some “efforts” are advertised to investigate crimes in Ukraine attributed to the Russian army. All this is arranged. We see it very well.
3514	45	Neither the bloody 2014 state attack in Kiev, neither the tragedy in Odessa on May 2, 2014, neither the shooting of peaceful cities in Donbass, neither the bombing of Lugansk by military aircraft on June 2, 2014 and many other facts have not been the cause of any understandable response by the International Criminal Court (ICC). More than 3,000 people entered the MTK. Reporting the crimes against the inhabitants of Donbass. There was no reaction.
3514	47	Most obviously now the leadership of this “judicial body” has received “from the top” an order to develop an energetic activity. We don’t trust this body. For eight years we have been waiting for the beginning of the fight against impunity in Ukraine. We no longer count on the justice of this and many other international institutions. The time of waiting has ended. Everything I said again confirms that the decision to carry out a special military operation was inevitable. We talked about it many times. We presented a huge number of facts showing how Ukraine was preparing to play a “anti-Russian” role, a trampoline to create and implement threats to Russian security.
3514	49	I am sure we will not allow it.
3515	1	What the victory of the extreme right will bring to Italy and Europe
3515	3	In the atmosphere of enormous disappointment throughout the political scene and with a record-low frequency of parliamentary elections in Italy, the right-wing coalition with the ultra-nationalists headed. This is a bad news for migrants, LGBT people and minorities. The problem is also the European Union and possibly Ukraine. Putin’s allies will be in the government.
3515	5	This was an extremely unstable (even as in Italy) term of parliament. Three different government coalitions and many political crises, of which the latter led to last week's early elections. This, of course, comes with international confusion, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine on the forefront. The Italians captured a variety of rescue wheels, but even Super Mario failed to deal with this bullying.
3515	7	Mario Draghi's government of national unity collapsed in July. Maybe it was inevitable. The coalition consisted of all major parties, and each of them had a different vision of leading the country. However, the most on Draghi's fall was earned by the extreme right-wing Italian Brothers (Fratelli d'Italia, FdI), who were the only ones who remained unchanged in the opposition throughout the term. In the coming, they will enter the new government, and it is immediately with the position of Prime Minister in the garst.
3515	9	The triumph of the right
3515	11	Pre-election forecasts confirmed, which predicted a decisive victory of the right-wing coalition: it won 44 percent. The vote will reach 237 seats in the 400 seats of the House of Representatives.
3515	13	This number of mandates is largely derived from a mixed electoral order – in 121 of the 146 one-and-a-hand districts, the right has defeated divided rivals. The central-left coalition gained 26 percent. The 5 Star Movement votes 15 percent and the Liberal 8 percent.
3515	15	The greatest winners are definitely the Italian Brothers, who received more support than their coalition allies took together.
3515	17	This means that the new government is likely to be led by Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the FDI, and its partners will be Salvini and Berlusconi. Thus the most right-wing government in the history of the Republic of Italy will be formed, and the European establishment must put his hopes in Silvio Berlusconi.
3515	19	Let’s remember that the veteran of Italian politics himself began his career as a populist media magnate who was willing to cooperate with nationalist radicals. Berlusconi broke with the anti-fascist ethos of the latter Italy, shifted the political scene to the right, and also broke the way to Trump and other Orbán.
3515	21	Forza Italia is the most moderate (and at the same time the weakest) member of the triumvirate, which will soon rule Italy. Beside him will sit the well-known of the pro-Russian sympathy Matteo Salvini and above all Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the winning FdI. The former prime minister in the Berlusconi government will be the first prime minister in Italy's history, but it's hard to see it as a victory of progressive values if she looks at Meloni's political backdrop.
3515	23	The Italian Brothers recognize themselves as the continuators of the MSI (Movimento Sociale Italiano) and even have in their own logo the symbol of this party, a three-colored flame. For the neo-Fascists of the MSI, established in the place of the illegalized Mussolini group, it had to represent loyalty to the ideas of Duce.
3515	25	In the after-war Italy, other parties submitted extreme right to ostracism, refusing any cooperation with Mussolini's funerals and regarding their views as contrary to the ideas of the Republic. Now, however, the successors of the MSI triumphally reach the power. What are their goals?
3515	27	Italy without immigrants, without LGBT lobby and without Peppa's pig
3515	29	At the same time, the Salvin League promoted itself through anti-immigration proposals, and the Italian Brothers have a similar program on this issue. Meloni talks about the “marine blockade” and the failure to pass any boat with migrants to Italy. It also threatens the deportation of hundreds of thousands of unregulated Italians. As you can guess, Muslims are encountered with a particular hostility as the alleged enemy of civilization, but the Romans and the Black are also the objects of attacks.
3515	31	The xenophobia does not end – the FdI leader promises the defense of family and religion, and the main threats to them are LGBT lobby and political correctness. Recently, the anger of the Italian right handed against the children's fairy tale, because there appeared a single pair of missions in it. It sounds absurd, but the Italian LGBT community is not to laugh. Like many women whose right to abortion is under question.
3515	33	The Italian brothers therefore propose a reactive approach to customary matters, but Meloni tries to present it as the ordinary, defending Christian values of conservation. He does this effectively, on the one hand, attracting moderate right-wing voters, and on the other hand, not disturbing those more radical.
3515	35	For the use of these recent FdI leaders sometimes expresses nostalgia to Mussolini or the subsequent MSI, but usually claims that fascism politically does not exist, and no longer in its party. But this is the trial of some activists who are going to make a Roman greeting or praise Hitler. These are individual cases, but they show the proximity of the Meloni party to the radicals, despite the relief of programming postulates.
3515	37	Europe is in a difficult term.
3515	39	Not so long ago, the Italian Brothers and the Salvin League talked about leaving the European Union or the euro area. They don’t want to do so, but they still have reasons to worry in Brussels. Meloni during the campaign announced the struggle against EU bureaucrates and more independent Italy’s policy. The Polish government is therefore getting an ally that supports the idea of “Europe of Fathers”.
3515	41	The victory of the right side may also be worrying in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Salvini party had previously received funding from the Kremlin, and Berlusconi recently claimed that Putin’s goal was “to replace the Zelensky government with good people.”
3515	43	Meloni itself has strictly condemned the invasion and strongly supports Ukraine in war with Russia, but it is rather the result of political rescue. In 2018, she congratulated Putin for the re-election to the presidency, and just a year ago she called him a “defense of European values and Christian identity.” He also supported the Russian pseudoreferendum on the occupied Crimea in 2014.
3515	45	The circumstances have caused her to change her narrative, but neither Meloni's partners nor her statements from the past are optimistic. In the best scenario we will be witnessing a similar situation as during the Draghi governments – Italy will lead a pro-Ukrainian policy, but sabotaged by a part of its own government coalition.
3515	47	In the worst? Meloni will enter a conflict with Brussels and start looking for ways to ignore the sanctions imposed on Russia if they will be painful for Italy.
3515	49	For the opposition, the most important thing will be to defeat the “non-voting party”
3515	51	Often in the discussions around Italian elections the largest group of voters is missing: those who do not vote.
3515	53	The voting absence amounted to 36 percent this year, while the Italian Brothers gained the support of less than 17 percent. the right to vote. The entire right-wing coalition received about 12 million votes, a little more than in the previous elections.
3515	55	The parliamentary majority of Meloni, Salvini and Berlusconi, therefore, are due not as much to the conviction of new voters as to the disappointment of Italy with other groups and the general political scene. The level of citizens’ confidence in democratic institutions is record low, and this translates into frequency.
3515	57	A few years ago, more than 80 percent. The Italians regularly went to the urn, less than 64 percent in the last week. of them. Moreover, the absence is visible among the poorest social layers. In the center of Milan, the frequency was 20 percent points more than in some districts of Naples or Palermo.
3515	59	This strengthens the right, and at the same time shows the defeat of the left, whose traditional people’s electorate mostly preferred to stay at home, without feeling represented by any party. There are at least a few reasons here: it has not helped in recent years to support other “technocratic” governments, but the Central-Levic coalitions have already lost the hopes of the voters when they came to power. They were avoiding more ambitious reforms that could bring Italy out of the marshmallow.
3515	61	It is doubtful that the right-wing coalition will be able to solve the country’s social problems, since the most important thing for it is to fight the imaginary threats such as “LGBT lobby.” This will create an opportunity for the opposition to win in the next elections, but to take advantage of it, it must reinvent and convince the former voters that it has to offer something more than the return of the technocrates.
3516	1	Capitalism runs on women's bodies
3516	3	Capitalism (incorporated in corporations and liberal parties) earns people working in wages. Conservation (including In the Church and right-wing parties) he tries to subordinate women to the domination of men. These are not two separate forces. Conservation is the weapon that capitalism is launching in times of crisis.
3516	5	I am pregnant on the 27th week. Two months ago I had to eat lunch with a friend, let’s call him Tim, although because of pregnancy it was hard for me to keep anything in my stomach. We talked about the abortion law that occurred in the United States.
3516	7	Tim has rather liberal views and believes that the law on the right to abortion in the Netherlands where we live should not change. At the same time, he believes that someone should stand at the guard of the rights of “unborn children”. “This fetus is a part of my body and it’s me who decides about it,” I said, adding the basic argument of the party to the choice. — No — said Tim. This fruit is not part of your body, it is only in your body.
3516	9	I didn’t think that at this stage of pregnancy anything could make me even worse, but this last note achieved just that effect. It was so unfortunate that at that time the partner Tim was also in the first trimester of pregnancy and experienced similar extreme symptoms.
3516	11	There is nothing to surprise. In the first trimester of pregnancy, we not only produce a new man somehow from zero, but we also form a completely new, big and complex organ – the placebo. According to the evolutionary biology specialist Suzanne Sadedin, the human plasma, unlike the plasma of most other plasma, “treats” into our veins and arteries, and its cells “massively penetrate and change them in a way beneficial for the fetus.”
3516	13	These cells are so invasive that the whole “colons of such cells often remain in the mother’s body for the rest of her life” by entering her liver and brain. The majority of grapes simply empty or absorb the unwanted fetus at any stage of pregnancy. This is not the case with people. “Every such anxiety carries with it the risk of a bleeding caused by the discharge of the plaque” from our blood system. That’s why abortion can be so dangerous.
3516	15	The concept that our body is merely an empty vessel in which a unborn child is located is a rather effective element of the anti-abortion propaganda, but is moving with reality. It is also possible to say that the newborn brings a bottle.
3516	17	This narrative aims to separate in our minds the fetus from the person who forms it from its body and within it. In this way, it is intended to justify the compulsion of women, non-binary and trans, who may get pregnant, to breeding in the name of that separate, or unwavering being – the “unborn child.”
3516	19	These and similar, carefully manipulated networks of words shape the ideological front of war spoke to women, which has been running since the times of witch hunting. This war was declared to women not because a couple of stupid men (and women) came to power. It is part of a recurring cycle, deeply ingested in our economic system.
3516	21	From the very beginning, that is, from the early modernity, capitalism itself periodically generates a reproductive crisis. In response to it, states and corporations are looking for new ways to generate profits, often escaping to violence. Their actions can solve a given crisis for a moment, but at the same time they sow the seeds of a new crisis, whose arrival becomes inevitable.
3516	23	The female bodies are in the heart of this cycle – and we are just once again at the point where that crisis is manifested.
3516	25	Hunting for Wizards
3516	27	In the 16th and 17th centuries, hundreds of thousands of women across Europe and both Americas were burned on their legs, hanged on their shrubs, drowned and raped. In search of the satan's pen, they were pulled over the whole body; they were broken up with horses and scattered their bones. It may seem to be the wild excesses of some overwhelming past. However, as the researcher Silvia Federici says in the 2004 book Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation, witch hunting was the main element of the construction of the then emerging capitalist economy.
3516	29	According to the Federici, the hunting of witches served three goals: to trigger divisions in the working class, to exchange mothers into tools to generate profits, and to reduce the cost of women’s work.
3516	31	At that time, capitalism was one of the new economic systems that departed from the model in which people produced goods primarily for their own use. Since then, the majority had to work in the earnings, producing goods for the upper social layers, which layers were then these goods paid for their own profits.
3516	33	We are usually fed by the history of how the transition from feudalism to capitalism took place through technological and social progress. Every conflict was intended to be played only between the old aristocracy and the new bourgeoisie, as it was during the French revolution or in North America.
3516	35	The Federici showed, however, that the new economic system of the expulsion was the way of an alliance between the church authorities, the tribe and the housing, which jointly declared the bloody war to the boy and the working class living in the cities.
3516	37	In Europe, this war has reached its peak along with the expulsions, a process of privatization, through which it has been forced to leave its role and to seek – anyway – a job in cities and cities. In Africa, Asia and both Americas, the class war took the form of genocide, slavery and forced labour under the principles of contractual slavery.
3516	39	Capitalism could not happen without this robbery, which resulted in the assembly of the capital needed to trigger the industrial revolution. In her research, Federici showed that equally unnecessary for the power of capitalism was the robbery of female bodies and female labour.
3516	41	Genocide and land wasting had quite unpleasant side effects. According to Federici, the population of South America increased by 75 million people, and in Europe, the evacuation of cattle contributed to the first in recent inflation crisis, by allowing land owners to raise leases, and buyers to collect grains and raise prices. The real earnings fell by two-thirds.
3516	43	The hungry poverty was characterized by a low resistance to the epidemic of duma or ospa, so the population began to decrease. By the beginning of the 17th century, one-third of the population was destroyed in Germany.
3516	45	From the point of view of trade, such a loss of population was a negative signal. In the 20th and 30th years. In the 17th century the markets collapsed, trade stopped and unemployment spread, which jointly led to the first international economic crisis, called the “17th century crisis”. At that time, the capitalist economy was at the edge of collapse.
3516	47	What is more logical from the point of view of a newly established alliance of rulers than taking control of women’s bodies and their reproductive capabilities in such a situation?
3516	49	The witches were not caught by chance. Wizards were usually poor women, who were often accused of crimes related to mutuality or fertility. They were convicted of abortion, murdering children, throwing their blood and making elixirs from their bodies.
3516	51	Many witches were acousers or “smart grandmothers,” the traditional pests of knowledge of female reproductive cycles. While in the Middle Ages women had access to a certain scope of contraception through the use of herbs, from which was made the edges and caps, now contraception has become a proof of listening to the satanic subjects.
3516	53	When my friend told me that the government should protect unborn children from women, he probably did not realize that the uterus was a matter of state weight for just a few centuries.
3516	55	Federici describes the process of taking births by male doctors. The break was overwhelmed by restrictive regulations, whose break threatened to be lost by cutting the head. The female sexuality has ceased to be something that women could enjoy; it has become a service for the economy and men.
3516	57	The attack on the female body was accompanied by the devaluation of their work and the predefining of femininity itself. The motor of the new economy has become a heterosexual, patriarchal family. They have strictly unregulated roles. The place of the woman has since been in the house, and all the household works performed by the women were defined as household duties, a kind of non-work.
3516	59	This non-work also included all the activities related to reproduction – both the birth of children itself, and all the care and household work that ensures people the possibility of survival and reproduction. Women were expected to do all this work not only for free, but also with a smile on their mouth, directed by a comfortable creation called the “mother’s instinct.”
3516	61	This does not mean that in the period of feudalism the gender was equal. In this regard, capitalism did not mean progress. The decrease of women’s work from value translated into lower wages when women tried to do their wages. According to the Federians in Western Europe in the 14th century, for doing the same work, women received half of what men were. In the middle of the 16th century, only one-third were earning.
3516	63	Federici shows that capitalism has therefore grown up on genocide, slavery and robbery as well as on the free and cheap work of women, which is thrown out of them with fire.
3516	65	New Class Wars
3516	67	Unfortunately, Federici decided to describe the history of capitalism in the 1990s. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, she observed a new phase of capitalism, a new class war and a new chapter of war against women.
3516	69	It was a time of globalization and structural correction. The previous, social-democratic phase of capitalism, which took place after the end of World War II, ended with a deep stagnation and fuel crisis. Since the 80s. The 20th century, the solution forced by the leaders of companies and governments worldwide, became neoliberalism.
3516	71	Central banks raised interest rates, leading to a deep recession. Governments and employers broke their trade unions and cut their wages. In response to the debt crisis caused by the rise of interest rates, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have forced countries that have just restored independence to sell land and resources to foreign corporations, to cut public expenditure and to lower working conditions.
3516	73	Governments and mass media have equated migrants with criminals, thus reducing their work costs. Police and the mass-scale justice department have caught black and dark workers into prisons.
3516	75	At the same time, Federici noted that poverty increasingly affected mostly women (the gap between men and women living in poverty increased) and that the number of cases of violence against women increased rapidly. In the RPA, Brazil and other parts of the world, literally, witches were hunted, and people who opposed corporate land robbery were often persecuted.
3516	77	Neoliberal politicians, such as Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and Augusto Pinochet, although they talked differently about abortion, had to confess “family values”, meaning a cisgender, heterosexual, patriarchal model of the family, forced for centuries by the Federians described witch hunters.
3516	79	The analogues with the current situation are unmistakable. Together with the climate apocalypse, the 2008 financial collapse and its endless consequences, the COVID-19 pandemic, and now also a new stagnant crisis, capitalism has almost everything. In response, the capitalists and the state began to look for new opportunities for earning money, which requires a new start of class war.
3516	81	Central banks will raise interest rates again. In response to the food and climate crisis, corporations are burning the land. Governments and are again attacking trade unions, privatizing and pursuing the “take of the belt”, again taking the target of migrants. Debt has risen up, and earnings are falling at a record rate, while profits are rising rapidly.
3516	83	Again, there are women in the midst. It is estimated that 80 percent. Climate refugees are women. During the pandemic women lost their jobs almost twice as often as men, because they are usually employment on waste contracts.
3516	85	The greater debt and the policy of cutting the belt more sensitively reflect on women who are usually poor and covered by child care, thus they are more dependent on public services. Due to the increased demand for caregiver work during the coronavirus pandemic, the costs of homework paid for by women have also increased.
3516	87	At the same time, LGBTQIA+ women and individuals experience greater violence, including domestic violence, resulting from periods of closure with their partners during the national quarantines charged in connection with covid. The politicians, of course, do not disappoint, the rulers again confess “traditional values” without hesitating to blame women and praise themselves with rape. Economic and physical violence go together, and both are part of a wider class war.
3516	89	Reproductive Crisis
3516	91	When the witch hunters burned the spots under the women, they didn’t know that they are just sowing the grains of another crisis that will explode centuries later. As we have already noticed, the economic model they designed was based on women’s free homework – childbirth, care and homework. At the same time, this model undermined the ability of women to provide such unpaid work, since women of the working class, however, have always had to work on wage to maintain themselves and their families.
3516	93	This is the reproductive crisis. According to some, for example, according to the social theorist Nancy Fraser, it is an indispensable part of capitalism. After World War II, a new, social-democratic type of capitalism temporarily undermined the situation, at least from the perspective of the middle class in wealthy countries. It was a time when the households could retain one salary, and the woman could be a household sheep – the men earned enough to provide the family with a living, and the women often did not make a wage job to take care of children.
3516	95	Because of neoliberalism, such a system has long gone to lamus. The forced reduction of wages led to the need for women of the middle class to undertake wage work, and women of the working class had to work longer. This was the result of the wound concerning homework – who should now take care of the children?
3516	97	In fact, public services and social security charges were also cut, making it even more difficult for families to stay. Those who were able to do so tried to get rid of this problem, the care and household work by ordering others, often workers’ immigrants. This is the way the “global chains of care work” are formed. This, however, did not solve the reproductive crisis, but only broke it elsewhere.
3516	99	Reproductive crisis is one of the reasons for which 60 percent. The world’s population is currently living in countries with a decrease in parentality. As a response to this, pronaletarian policies are again emerging, which are aimed at increasing childhood. This policy is currently approximately 30 percent. For comparison, in the 1970s. In the 20th century, it was only 10 percent. of countries.
3516	101	Pronatalist policy is not always a violation of reproductive rights; it may take into account, for example. Scholarships and loans for families choosing a third child – usually, however, the family must be heterosexual and cisgendero. However, from the United States, through Poland and Hungary, to China, Russia and Iran, the right to abortion is increasingly restricted.
3516	103	Among the extreme right, the pronatalist policy is linked with beliefs of the A great replacement – a conspiracy theory that the European civilization should be removed from the surface of the earth by immigrants coming from Muslim countries and a high rate of childhood among the white population. However, such concepts are always closely connected with economic goals.
3516	105	Conservation in cultural policy is often seen as unrelated to practical economic policy. In fact, he was inseparable from the beginning. In Turkey, for example, President Erdoğan called abortion “mord,” suggesting that it was a record aimed at causing a economic stagnation in the country.
3516	107	My friend Tim is not aware of it. But his desire for the state to control the bodies of women puts him on the wrong side of the barricade in the ongoing class war. Violence against women is not due to the fact that the power is carried out by men and corrupt politicians. It has always been included in the operating system of the capitalist economy and grows every time capitalism is in the shadows, leading to another crisis. Just ask the witches.
3517	1	Jarosław Kaczyński: We have a German party in Poland. It’s hard to change when we’re in the EU.
3517	3	The reform of the court is necessary. However, making changes in the conditions of our presence in the European Union is very difficult,” PiS President said in a conversation with Radio Lodz.
3517	5	Last week, Jarosław Kaczyński visited the war. Meeting with m.in. The people of Pabianic and Sieradza. He also gave a public interview to Radio Boat, which was broadcast on Monday morning.
3517	7	I have a German party in Poland. In our history there have been strangers that have appealed to the external forces and showed a far-going loyalty to them. Today we have this phenomenon again and this is an extremely harmful phenomenon, and its most complete representation is KO, and in particular — here he already uses the names — just Donald Tusk — said Kaczynski.
3517	9	The president also responded to the question of the change in the jurisdiction. The reform of the courts is absolutely necessary. What is happening today in the court is an absolute scandal. The systemic inequality of citizens in respect of law. These exposed, not from ours, but on the other hand, have a guaranteed not even amnesty, but abolition. “This needs to be changed, although in the existing political conditions, especially in our presence in the European Union, it is very difficult,” Kaczynski said.
3517	11	The head of the PiS, asked about inflation, said that this situation affects the whole of Europe, and “the society’s purchasing power does not decline significantly.” “I’m talking about the whole society, because of course there are groups that don’t benefit from this growth and we don’t neglect it,” he added.
3517	13	"Kaczynski pointed out that ""the authority does not use the sharpest methods, such as Balcerovich."" The drug industry collapsed, later partially decreased in private enterprises. This does not mean that what was, was restored, it was impossible. However, more could be defended. This requires a different policy. There are places on the border with the Czech Republic, where stocks fell in Poland and in the Czech Republic survived. It didn’t have to be so, he convinced."
3517	15	Kaczynski was also asked about the necessary reform of the European Union, which was also one of the topics of the meeting in Pabianice. “Of course we’re not able to do this by ourselves,” PiS said and as an example mentioned the victories in Sweden and Italy in the elections by conservative forces, as well as the elections to the European Parliament in 2024, which, in his opinion, give a perspective to remove the current system of forces from power.
3517	17	As he pointed out, if the political situation in Europe changes, it will be much easier to change in the Union itself. “There’s to take the factor of time and keep some patience,” said the President of Law and Justice.
3518	1	Does Scheuring-Wielgus lose immunity? The meeting will decide on Friday.
3518	3	The summit addresses the proposal to withdraw the immunity of Joannie Scheuring-Wielgus. The Lewica deputy said the prosecutor’s office had “badly interfered with the execution of the religious act of the Catholic Church” in the Church of Turin in 2020. As she explained on Thursday, her behavior two years ago was just a “reaction to the behavior of the priests who openly teach and struggle women.” Before the Sejm was also interpreted by the deputy Boris Budka ws. The Messengers of Liechtenstein.
3518	5	Report of the Committee on Regulations, Parliamentary Affairs and Immunity The request of the regional prosecutor in Toronto was submitted by the deputy rapporteur Zbigniew Dolata. The regulatory committee agreed on Tuesday to withdraw the immunity of Joannie Scheuring-Wielgus (Lewica) as a result of her interference with the mosque in the church in 2020. Nine members voted for the withdrawal of immunity and six were against.
3518	7	“I went into the church and stood in silence with the message: ‘Woman, you can decide yourself.’” From this place he wants to say that I am pleased that we have talked about this communication for two years on this tectural, a deputy from the Seymour spokesman said on Thursday. “It’s not me, but the priests and bishops introduced politics to the church,” she continued.
3518	9	The parliament mentioned several examples: bp Ignacy Dec in August of this year, in Lübnan during the Mass praised the politicians of the PiS and thanked for being in power. Abp Sławoj Leszek Gladz, during the Mass in the Preaching talked about gender ideology. He compared it to totalitarianism and talked about leftism. The subject of abortion before me in the church was moved by the Swedish bishop Marek Mendyk. During the Mass, he laughed on the rights of women to self-establish their own body. And bp Marek Jędraszewski, who repeatedly talked about the tissue infection on the day when the judgment of TK Julii Przyłębskaya fell, said he was very pleased with this decision - she added.
3518	11	Scheuring-Wielgus spoke about the church’s involvement in the fight against LGBT and political life. Mr. Warhol has recently praised it. In the secular state, the minister does not consult the law with experts and lawyers, only with the bishop and still praise it, she said.
3518	13	As she explained, her behavior two years ago was just a “reaction to the behavior of the priests who openly teach and struggle women.”
3518	15	I did not enter the church as a messenger. I entered this church as a woman and as a mother on behalf of hundreds of thousands of women who, after the shameful judgment of the Church of Julia, led to the fact that women could not legally carry out abortion. I also came to say “no” to the church, which is interfering in the intimate affairs of women, because pregnancy is the affairs of a woman, not a priest, a bishop, or any political party.
3518	17	The mission addressed women: Sisters. You can decide yourself. You know if you want to have children. Trust yourself. Do not listen to priests, politicians, or judges of the Constitutional Court.
3518	19	"The court said the prosecution by the prosecutor’s office was a “purely political matter.” ""Mr. Ziobro, who persecutes me and my family, knows well that this case is murdered in the face of my husband, but Ziobro does not agree with it, he cannot survive it, so he makes a cassation to the Supreme Court,"" she said. Scheuring-Wielgus that this issue is merely about the frightening and inclination of ""everyone who has the courage to oppose what the PIS government and the church do."""
3518	21	Prosecutor calls for punishment
3518	23	"The Toruan Prosecutor's Office, as its representative said at the commission meeting, wants to accuse Joanne Scheuring-Wielgus of being in the church in October 2020 at the invitation of St. Louis. Jacob in Toruni evilly interfered in the execution of the religious act of the Catholic Church, ""in the same time neglecting the place intended for the execution of religious rituals and offending the religious feelings of others."""
3518	25	The messenger of the Lewica and his husband Peter the Great went into the church, stood behind the altar and kept a transparency: “The woman can decide by itself” and “Women should have the right to decide whether to give birth or not.” Then the same tables showed the messengers.
3518	27	This behavior exhausts a sign of art. 195 par. 1 of the Criminal Code and art. 196 of the Criminal Code. There are grounds to present Ms. Joannie Scheuring-Wielgus the allegation, the prosecutor said.
3519	1	“Citizens and too white.” French harcers want to change their image by promoting leftist absurdities
3519	3	Traditionally, the French Scouts released a new calendar for 2023. He attracted the attention of the media, because he runs in it from quotes and illustrations of ecology activists, feminism, migration defenders, etc. The calendar resembles the content of “progress agitator note”. Published by Scouts et Guides de France (SGDF), the country’s largest harcers’ association, has raised controversy by the scouts themselves.
3519	5	 The annual sale of the calendar takes place between October and December, and its main objective is to power the cash of the harcers. The heroes of this year’s idealized version are figures such as Greta Thunberg, American communist Angela Davis, or former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela.
3519	7	The new, indoctrinatory formula raised the concerns of the SGDF taxpayer. Every year, they will sell 360,000 copies of the calendar. Usually, as the harcer explained, the fulfillment of this task was not a problem, and the products dispersed like “heat cells”, but controversial content could lead to a decline in popularity.
3519	9	On similar doubts, however, the leadership of the organization has an answer – it turns out that in the distribution of the calendar it is not the first to support the organization’s financial support – but to “eliminate the stereotypes.” According to the leadership of the leading scout gathering, the young people gathered by them are seen as “local and too white.” “Our goal is not to provoke, but to connect with today’s youth, not yesterday’s youth,” the organizational leadership added.
3519	11	Les Scouts et Guides de France (SGDF) is now the main French harcers' association, formed as a result of the merger between Scouts de France and Guides de France in 2004. In the roots, both of these groups had a Catholic character – so far the group was formed from their association and has an awarded chapel. However, it declares that it is linked to “a pluralist Catholic movement, open to all.”
3519	13	Since the 1970s, there has been a number of divisions in the organization that did not want to recognize further new reforms and deviations from traditional harcers. In the 21st century, the educational project of these scouts already talks about becoming “the citizens of the world, united and responsible.” Nevertheless, the Scout movement in France enjoys great social sympathy. This popularity was just decided to be used for “progressive agitation.”
352	1	The Arizona judge resumed the abortion law in 1901. Kellie Johnson holds his decision
352	3	The Arizona judge, Kellie Johnson, refused to suspend his own judgment to enforce the law that considers abortion a crime. It also supported the laws of 1901.
352	5	The judgment of Judge Kellie Johnson of the Supreme Court in the County of Pima means that abortion persons in Arizona will not be able to resume abortion procedures unless the cases are necessary for the rescue of the mother's life. In 1901, Arizona became the 48th State of the United States in 1912.
352	7	The laws allowing abortion began to enter into force in Arizona after the U.S. Supreme Court issued in 1973 a judgment in the famous case Roe against Wade, recognizing the constitutional right of women to interrupt pregnancy. Nearly a half a century later, on June 24, this year, the judgment was repealed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
352	9	Advocates from the office of the Republican Prosecutor General of Arizona, Mark Brnovich, explained that since the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on June 24 says that women have no constitutional right to get abortion, there is no legal reason to block the old law of 1901.
352	11	Abortion advocates appeal
352	13	Lawyers from the “pro choice” Planned Parenthood called on Judge Johnson to suspend the judgment to enable appeal.
352	15	Before issuing her last week judgment, abortions were legal in Arizona until the fetus became able to live, usually around the 24th week of pregnancy. The law was adopted by the state legislation last year, which prohibits abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy.
352	17	Brittany Fonteno, from Planned Parenthood in Arizona, said she was “hurt” by Johnson’s position.
3520	1	Back to the left in Brazil
3520	3	In the second round of the Brazilian presidential election of October 30, 2022, the marginal victory was won by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. 1945) from the Working Party (port. Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT), defeating the official president Jaira Bolsonaro (ur. 1955) from the Liberal Party (port. The Liberal Party (PL) Lula da Silva gained 50.9% of the votes (60.345 million). J. Bolsonaro and 49.1% of the votes (58.206 million). the votes). The office of the elected president is announced on 1 January 2023.
3520	5	marginal victory
3520	7	L. I. Lula da Silva won in the western and northern states, earning the most votes in Bahia, Piaui, Cairo and Maranhão, a little less in Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíbie, Pernambuco and Sergipe, winning also in Alagoas, Minas Gerais, Tocantins, Parze and Amazonas. Bolsonaro scored the highest in Rondonia, Acre and Roraima, slightly lower in Mato Grosso, Paraná and Santa Catarina, also winning in Amapia, Goiás, Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espiritu Santo and Rio Grande do Sul.
3520	9	The difference between the candidates in the second round was only 2 million. Votes, which is the smallest difference in the history of the Brazilian presidential elections from the restitusion of demoliberalism in 1985. Lula da Silva won no absolute majority with only 48.4% of the votes (J. Bolsonaro won 43.2% of the votes). This creates suspicion that J. Bolsonaro, who has not so far congratulated the opponent of victory, may suspect the outcome of the election.
3520	11	On the other hand, the result of L. I. Luli da Silvy in the first round is the second highest result in the PT history, depending only on the result of L. I. Luli da Silvy in 2006.
3520	13	Foreign Congratulations
3520	15	The elected president has so far been able to congratulate Argentine President Alberto Fernández and Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Chile President Gabriel Boric, Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (he expressed hope that there will be “equality and humanism”), Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro (“Let the people who are dedicated to freedom, sovereignty and independence live!

3520	17	The victories of L. I. Luli da Silvie also congratulated Chinese leader Xi Jinping (he expressed hope for the development of “strategic and long-term plans”and “the rise of a comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level”, considering that the deepening of bilateral cooperation will benefit “the preservation of regional and global peace and stability, and the promotion of universal development and well-being”), Russian leader Vladimir Putin (he expressed hope for further development of relations, he stressed that Russia had good relations with both L.

The congratulatory message with the invitation of the new Brazilian president to submit a visit to Poland has also appeared on the President's website.
3520	19	Lula's way to the presidency
3520	21	For L. I. Luli da Silvy, the current presidential elections were the sixth in his political career: he successfully nominated in 1989, 1994 and 1998, in 2002 to finally take the presidency and again win the 2006 elections. in 2010 the president was supported by him and previously employed in his administration by Dilma Rousseff, who repeated his term in 2014, but in 2016 he was subjected to impeachment under the accusation of participation in the corrupt affair of the Odebrecht, and the post was followed by unpopular Michel Temer.
3520	23	In 2017, L. I. Lula da Silva was also convicted of corruption in the framework of the prosecutor Sergio Moro’s anti-corruption operation “Majnia” (port. Operação Lava Jato – the name derives from the conviction of the workers who drank dirty money, from which the investigation began) and the political rights were taken from him, although he was conducting in pre-election surveys. In the 2018 presidential elections, the PT showed the unknown mer São Paulo Fernando Haddada, who lost with a crete against J. Bolsonaro. In 2019, however, Lula da Silva was released from prison and in 2021 he was restored to political rights, which immediately made him a favourite of the 2022 election.
3520	25	Foreign Policy J. Bolsonaro
3520	27	Bolsonaro's presidency meant even a grotesque enthusiasm for the United States and Israel, which was accompanied by the refusal of China, Iran and Palestine to like Washington and Tel Aviv. Bolsonaro also showed sympathy to Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and the right-wing Italy. He also referred friendly to Russia, encouraging Vladimir Putin to join the Western Conservative Coalition. In the last few months of his presidency, Bolsonaro has dismissed his Vice-President Hamilton Murão for his statement that Brazil condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 2019, Brazil recognized Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela.
3520	29	Bolsonaro’s position was clearly hostile to Mercosur (the Common Southern Market – hisp. Mercado Común del Sur, established in 1991 in Asunción the economic block of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay), although ultimately did not decide to withdraw Brazil from this organization. During his presidency, Brazil also adopted an aggressive course against Venezuela and Cuba, seeking to join the NATO and the U.S. military base on its territory to control Russia’s influence in Latin America. At the request of Washington, Brazil rejected the purchase of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, but after replacing Donald Trump by Joe Biden as U.S. President, Bolsonaro met with Vladimir Putin to discuss the creation of a Russian-Brazilian consortium for the production of Sputnik V in Brazil and the comprehensive development of relations between Russia and Brazil.
3520	31	Politics of J. Bolsonaro
3520	33	Even controversial and uneffective were the internal actions of the Brazilian president. In 2019 he left his native Social-Liberal Party (port. Partido Social Liberal, PSL), after a series of conflicts with its leader Luciano Bivar, which caused a wave of withdrawal among the members of his administration. The attempt to establish a Conservative Party of the Alliance for Brazil (Port. Aliança pelo Brasil) ended with failure and in 2021 J. Bolsonaro joined the PL.
3520	35	Finally, in the 2022 elections, J. Bolsonaro left with the support of PL, the conservative-green holy Republicans (port. Republicanos) and the technocratic “Partido del Poder” (supported almost all presidential administrations, were the center of the Odebrecht affair) of the Prosecutors (port. The Progressist. His mother-in-law PSL in October 2021 joined the right-wing Liberal Democrats (port. Democrats, DEM), forming the Union of Brazil (port. It has received 9.31% of the votes and 59 seats in the 513-person House of Representatives.
3520	37	Military crisis in 2021.
3520	39	Partly denialistic and partly chaotic, the policy of J. Bolsonaro on the issue of the COVID-19 epidemic led him to a sharp conflict with the authorities of some Brazilian states, such as São Paulo. The state authorities introduced traffic and transport blocks, which Bolsonaro opposed in the name of saving the economy. Against the state authorities, the president tried to appeal to the Supreme Federal Court, but it supported the state authorities. After J. Bolsonaro successfully tried to send the army to the Court, to introduce a state of emergency and war, on 29 March 2021, he eventually eliminated the blocking political involvement of the army of the National Defense Minister General Fernando Azawedo e Silva, appointing Walter Braga Netto in his place. In response, on 30 March, the commander of the Brazilian land forces, aviation and military fleet resigned. On 31 March, the President, in order to prevent the escalation of the crisis, appointed the followers of demisioned officers not among his supporters but among the candidates belonging to the age line, but contesting his policy.
3520	41	The Amazon issue
3520	43	J. Bolsonaro also damaged his climate policy and the support of the Amazonian equatorial forest cutting and landslide to its native peoples. The majority of foreign congratulations for J. I. Luli da Silvy expressed hope for effective cooperation in the fight against the Amazon dewastation and in this direction are also the announcement of the president-elect. Immediately after the announcement of his victory, Lula da Silva announced that “Brazil is ready to recover its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis”, especially through the protection of the Amazon. On Twitter, the president-elect can find an announcement of the reduction of the deforestation of Amazon to zero. “Brazil and our planet need a living Amazon,” he said.
3520	45	During President J. Bolsonaro's 180% (from 109 cases in 2018 to 305 cases in 2022) the number of acts of violence by farmers, beef shepherds, drvals, miners and clowners against the indigenous peoples of Brazil increased. These attacks have affected 226 indigenous territories in 22 Brazilian states, where 800,000 people live today. Americans in 300 tribes. On the other hand, on October 31, supporting J. Bolsonaro, truck and car drivers blocked roads in the agricultural state of Mato Grosso and at least twelve other states – including Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The issue of collision of ecological goods with economic interests has turned out to be one of the most burning in the election campaign and will remain that in the coming years.
3520	47	Luli da Silvy Marina Silva announced that Brazil will send representatives to the UN climate summit COP27 in Egypt on 31 October. Norway has announced that it will transfer $575 million to Brazil to counter the Amazon dewastation. $20 billion was promised to be transferred to the United States. According to M. Silvy, Brazil for the third term L. I. Luli da Silvy will also reduce the emissions of methane and carbon dioxide and will hold a conference of the countries of the Amazon and the West on the rescue of rainforest in 2023. Brazil has a special state institution to be established. the climate, which has to coordinate the activities of the respective departments in this field.
3520	49	Approach to Abortion
3520	51	L. I. Luli da Silvy’s position on the issue of abortion is quite angry, since in April he spoke for its admissibility, against the negative receipt of his words, but on October 19 he stated that it is against it: “Not only I am against abortion, but also all the women I married (sic!) They are against abortion. And I think almost everyone is against abortion. Not only because we are the defenders of life, but also because it must be very unpleasant and painful for someone – having an abortion.”
3520	53	A little more light on the president-elect position throws the analysis of his statements on this issue from his next election campaigns. All of them can be brought to the conclusion that L. I. Lula da Silva privately – as “man”, “father of five children”, “catholic”, “Christian”, “conservative” (sic! In 2016, he said he was against abortion. As President of the Republic, however, he believes that “this should be a matter of public health” and “everyone should have the right to do so and not be ashamed of it.” The president-elect, therefore, takes a typical position for the majority of abortion supporters and should be considered one of them.
3520	55	Lulism
3520	57	The views of J. I. Luli da Silvy on economic policy are in a social-liberal corner (port. by Lulismo. Lulism is a reformism aimed at a gradual structural social change, aimed at enabling de facto excluded from the national economic organism poverty social advance to the middle class and integration into the national community. Lulism emphasizes the importance of macroeconomic stability, market reliability and state redistribution. It aims to gain the trust of both domestic and foreign capital and to attract the support of the poor layers. Lulism strongly opposes the idea of the “class struggle” and seeks to compromise with capital, in the name of expanding the scope of the market with the previously excluded.
3520	59	On the foundation of Lulism, the idea of organization and political mobilization is rejected, since the change is to be made within the framework of the legal-state order and to be animated from the top. The capital in it is to be a co-operator of the state, in return preserving the majority of the profits and freedom of operation. L. I. Lula da Silva during his presidency (2002-2010) led to reconciliation with the Brazilian conservative sector, continuing the macroeconomic stability policy of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002), supplementing it with a redistribution. It was not only benefited by the poor, but also by the banks, the craftsmen and the merchants, and in 2010 Brazil became the seventh economy in the world (now it is thirteen).
3520	61	The outcome point of Lulism is the assumption of the predictability and reliability of macroeconomic indicators and the transparency of the rules and policies of the state, which should give the capital a sense of security. Inflation should be controlled, liquid exchange rates and budget surplus should beined. Not all of these objectives have been achieved, as the monstruous and expensive state of the Odebrecht affair testifies. In addition, the rising inflation during D. Rousseff’s presidency (2011-2016) undercovered the foundations of Lulism. The actual liberalization of the labour law in 2017 under the governments of Michel Temer (2016-2018) meant a real withdrawal from Lulism.
3520	63	Economic Challenges
3520	65	In his third term, Lula da Silva will have to deal with the negative effects of the COVID-19 epidemic in the form of inflation (8,59%), unemployment (8.7%), slowing economic growth (3.2%) and growth of industrial production (1,4%). Blocking roads by Bolsonaro’s supporters in at least twelve Brazilian states could threaten agricultural fruit exports and reduce the market reliability of the country. In general, however, the indicators that describe the country’s economic situation don’t look bad.
3520	67	The victory of L. I. Luli da Silvy also met with a rather friendly response of Western capital: the Brazilian real won 2% against the US dollar, the Bovespa index at the end of the session was 1.3%, measuring the rating of 48 large and medium-sized Brazilian companies, the MSCI index rose by 4%. Goldman Sachs indicates in its analysis that the income support and debt restructuring policy announced by the president-elect will promote internal consumption, which is the pillar of the Brazilian economy. The “Apetit” on the real will increase profits from the interest rate differences and relatively low stock prices. Expected as the future Minister of Finance and Budget Planning Alexandre Padilha is well received by stock speculators.
3520	69	Meridonialism
3520	71	In foreign policy L. I. Lula da Silva promises the strengthening of relations with Mercosur, Unasur (United Nations of South America). Union de Naciones Suramericanas (United States of Latin America and the Caribbean) Communidad de Estados Latinoamericanos e Caribeños (Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos e Caribeños), a return to cooperation with the countries of Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. His position should therefore be placed in the context of the “meridonialism” born in the last twentieth century, that is, the direction in the Brazilian geopolitical thought that proposes a reversal from the Atlantic direction and the U.S. and NATO unions towards building Brazil’s position in the policentric world and on the basis of the continental South American integration. It corresponds to this repeated by Lula da Silva asking for a permanent place for Brazil in the UN Security Council and its support for the BRICS.
3520	73	Wind of Change
3520	75	The victory of L. I. Luli da Silvy signs “return to the left” (Hisp. Marea rosa changes the political landscape of Latin America. This trend began with Venezuela's presidents Hugo Chávez (1999-2013) and Nicolas Maduro (from 2013). The other countries covered are: Colombia – Gustavo Petro (from 2022); Peru – Pedro Castillo (from 2022); Bolivia – Evo Morales (2006-2019), Louis Arce (from 2020); Chile – Gabriel Boric (from 2022); Argentina – Néstor Kirchner (2003-2007), Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-2015), Alberto Fernández (from 2019); Panama – Laurentino Cortizo (from 2019); Nicaragua – Daniel Ortega (from 2007); Honduras – Xiomara Castro (from 2022); Mexico – Andrés Manuel López Obrador (from 2018), Cuba – Miguel Díazel (from 2019), Dominican Republic – Luis Abaderin (from 2020).
3520	77	Besides the marea rosa, only Uruguay, Paraguay and Ecuador remain in South America, and Costa Rica, Salvador and Guatemala in Central America. The left trend has also spread to North America: the United States (Joe Biden), Canada (Justin Trudeau) and Grenland (Múte Bourup Egende from the socialist-separatist Inuit Atagatigiit – from 2021). This state will not remain safe without influence on the directions of development of Latin American civilization and the situation throughout the Western Hemisphere.
3521	1	The National Resurrection of Poland on True and False Refugees
3521	3	The signed international agreements require the reception of war refugees and no one question it. Giving refuge to civilians fleeing war activities to the first safe (not chosen due to the social system) country is also a practical implementation of the principles of Catholic ethics. Unfortunately, in the demoliberal society, the spectacle concepts have long lost their primary meaning. Today, refugees are people who come from areas where no war is carried out. Today, refugees are persons from a country whose 80% of the territory is safe, all offices operate there and it has the obligation to provide refuge to its citizens. Today, “fighters” are people who travel to their homes for a holiday or a purpose of exchanging a closet (sic!). Today, “refugees” are very often people seeking a better life, provoked by social benefits. The Poles are paying for it.
3521	5	As Polish nationalists, we remind that the duty of the authorities is to save the lives of the refugees, not to raise their standard of life. The State is to provide real refugees with food and the roof above their head in accordance with the ratified conventions. All over this is an action to the harm of the Poles, because it is the need of our peoples to be in the first place, not immigrants or immigrants.
3522	1	Washing against the United States and other threats – interview with the President of the Polish Geostrategic Society
3522	3	The site was, is and will be a place where different opinions are presented, provided that they do not attack the Catholic Faith and the foundations of our idea. Presentation is a reason to discuss and develop your own position, and not necessarily to identify with anything. Events related to the “pandemic” (or as anyone wants the “pandemic”) and the war in Ukraine overwhelmed a lot when it comes to the political environment. The so-called appeared. Nationalists who engaged in the role of acquirers of pharmaceutical groups (some even demanded their order to use them) or their whole world relied on Ukraine. There have also been people who have not had contact with the nationalist movement before, but in the media and practice of action behave like nationalists, i.e. they consider Poland and the Poles, and not foreign and geopolitical murders. The following interview was carried out by Agnieszka Piwar, whose name appeared already on our portal. The speaker is Dr. Leszek Sykulski, whose curved way to the present views we described here. With many differences with the Doctor and Weekly, we are delighted by the criticism of liberalism, transhumanism, global finance, and above all by the calling of Prof. Felix the End and the proposals for the restoration of full sovereignty.
3522	5	How do you think of freedom of speech in the world today?
3522	7	I think there is a big problem with it. Of course, this is not that we have a preventive censorship, some office dedicated to it, but the fact is that in Poland very strongly develops the cancel culture or the culture of exclusion. This consists in the elimination of unlawful people from the public life, who are going to the edge of government narration or system narration. Such persons are eliminated from the positions in state companies and state universities and are removed from the main media. In general, such persons have difficulty in public life and functioning. They use art. Article 54 of the Constitution: Freedom of speech.We know that they are equal and equal. This whole cancel culture, which came to us from the Anglo-Saxon civilization, is such a soft totalitarianism. This means that, like in every totalitarianism, unfair people are eliminated, but here it is done in acamite gloves. The goal is to make it as smooth as possible. Not through any prisons, repressions, concentration camps or physical elimination.
3522	9	So there is undoubtedly a problem with freedom of speech and I think it was very strongly seen on February 24, 2022. It dominates one narrative, the prejudice, the provokative. And freedom of speech is limited to anyone who tries to say that it’s different, that it’s not necessarily reality is black and white, that there’s a lot of different shades, that we need to look broader into the entire geopolitical situation, and not just through the prism of the 24th of February, that the issue of helping the refugees from Ukraine is one, and organized displacement action is the second thing. There are a lot of discussion topics that are treated by the system as unacceptable and such people actually have a limited freedom of speech.
3522	11	We have a very strange situation. Therefore, on the one hand, some people have limited freedom of speech, and on the other hand, some environments have unlimited freedom in punishable scaling of others, especially those who speak differently about the situation in Ukraine. We all know the epithets of the type: “Russian agents”, “Kreml propagandists”, etc. The authors and collectors of these savings will not bear any consequences for their words. How is it possible?
3522	13	I think first of all we need to pay attention to the outcome of new defense experts, security, etc. These are really very strange people who had nothing to do with geopolitics, international affairs, political journalism, or defence. And in the meantime, they became exhaustive experts in geopolitics, security, defence, although they didn’t spend a day in the army, and the army was seen as high as possible on the Piłsudski Square in Warsaw. These people give a ton.
3522	15	"This is, of course, an organized action, I have no least doubt about this, because the services in Poland are subordinated to the US services today. In this context, it is worth recommending a very good book ""The End of the Empire of MSW"", published by the Institute of National Memory. The publication shows how the first MSW, the PRL interview, was subordinated by the CIA. This is what John Pomfret wrote in his last book “Welcome from Warsaw.” So evidence that the Polish special services are subordinated to the US or the Anglo-Saxon services is quite a lot. This is clearly proven by an investigation by the European Parliament or a series of international investigations. Secret CIA prisoners. We know that the officials of the intelligence agency have broken the constitution, broken the criminal code and have to stand before the court and be sentenced to heavy prison for what they did. Of course, not only AW officials, but also counterintelligence officials, ABW and politicians like Leszek Miller or President Aleksander Kwaśniewski. They violated Polish law and international law, because there was torture of people on the territory of Poland, there was the creation of illegal secret prisoners of a foreign state, etc."
3522	17	Therefore, we have a situation in which the Polish special services are subordinated to the US services. I don’t say that all officials, but this dependency is very strong. And today in the United States we have a tendency to defend liberal hegemony, to treat Poland, Ukraine and other countries of the region as geostrategic collisions.
3522	19	Dr. George Friedman wrote and talked about it, even in his famous interview to the Chicago Council of Global Affairs in 2016. Governance through conflict, by clinging the Eurasian countries, the creation of the Mediterranean, etc. This whole concept of the Triangle is nothing but a sanitary cordon in the sense of George Friedman. So it is absolutely not surprising that special services in Poland, which are largely subordinated to the interests of the liberal hegemony, seek to create one narrative. The pro-war narration, which shows Russia as a failed country, which just a moment loses, because there is no more practically missile, the Russian soldiers have no longer even a hat, not to mention the ounce. Therefore, there is in fact such permission to war actions undertaken among the Polish society, so there are exposed people totally random, without a green idea of geopolitics, security or defence.
3522	21	How to defend yourself from this?
3522	23	– Develop alternative groups, alternative information centers, as well as educational centers, because this is very important. But let’s not do this in a centralized way, because we see what the American approach is today to absolute control of everything and all. Alternative environments are best created on a network basis. Let us create such environments that will independently acquire information, increase self-consciousness and will not welcome the inventory of all this narrative that comes from the system.
3522	25	In one of his lectures, he said that a much greater threat from gender ideology or liberal democracy is the posthumanization process of international relations. Please explain to our readers what you thought about.
3522	27	“I thought of the ideology of transhumanism, which is developed primarily in the United States, but also in other countries, also in Europe. In Russia there are transhumanist societies, various types of associations and foundations that deal with it and companies that conduct research on it. In this ideology, it is about transcending the natural boundaries of man, to expand the mental and physical capacities of man with the help of the technologies that enter both the brain and the various types of biotechnology. But generally, the ideologists of tranhhumanism speak of the post-human era, to move human consciousness to artificial intelligence, to combine human consciousness with artificial intelligence. Elon Musk himself creates such concepts and projects in this field. And this is really very dangerous because the question is how far we can interfere in the genome of man. Here it returns the theme of eugenics, programming people, interfering with the human nature itself and creating a kind of cyborgs. I have no doubt that this kind of ideas are absolutely in the line with the principles of Latin civilization.
3522	29	What are the chances that Germany will realize its plan to form a federal European state? What does it mean to Poland if our western neighbors have their own?
3522	31	“I believe and repeat this for years that Germany is a much greater threat to Poland than Russia. For this reason, whenever Russia threatened us, it was a kind of consolidation of Latin civilization, the consolidation of national forces and the desire of the nation to survive. But the German threat is a spiritual threat, a threat by the destruction of cultural sovereignty. What the Germans today propose is not only the Energiewende, that is, the energy transformation, not only the concept of the Middle Europe, the concept of the federal Europe but also, and above all, the whole postmodernism, the cultural neomarxism and the destruction of the foundations of Latin civilization.
3522	33	This trend to deep federalization, to the formation of one state is very visible now not only in Germany, but also in France and Italy, which in 2021 signed the quirinal treaty. Germany has officially launched all kinds of federal concepts in Europe since the creation of the coalition SPD-FDP-Green in the autumn of 2021. And this is a much greater threat than the potential military threat from Russia. Why? Since the Polish-Russian war can be avoided and I think it’s not too late yet, although we have the autumn of 2022 and Polish foreign policy, the security policy underwritten to Washington has gone very far. I mean intervention in the internal affairs of Belarus, including in certain issues in the internal affairs of Russia. This has gone very far, but it can be stopped or reversed if there is a radical political change in Poland. For now it is not mentioned, but in social sciences there is the concept of black sheep, which Nassim Taleb wrote in his great book.
3522	35	Is the U.S. alliance a security guarantee?
3522	37	It is not. In recent years, it is seen that the alliance with the United States is creating a strategic collapse with Poland. I have no least doubts about this. What is the value of this alliance and how they really treat Poland, was seen on 15 August 2020 when the agreement between the United States and Poland was signed on the so-called. Strengthening defence cooperation. This agreement excludes from the jurisdiction of the Polish courts, from the jurisdiction of the Polish state those areas that occupy the U.S. armed forces on the territory of Poland. In fact, we cannot withdraw this agreement, because the termination time is up to two years. What is not included in this agreement? The United States has in no way committed to any additional defence support to Poland on the basis of specific clauses and to respond to specific threats. This agreement is comparable to the agreement between the United States and Iraq. Iraq was bombed, invaded and occupied by the United States in 2003. The situation between Iraq and Poland, at least theoretically, is completely different, but we see that the level of vasalization is quite close.
3522	39	Is it possible to remove American influence from our continent?
3522	41	In theory, everything is possible. On the other hand, it is necessary to realise the U.S. influence and how much German politics is subordinated to the United States. I think that this geopolitical testament to Angela Merkel clearly showed thatining good transatlantic relations is today in the interest of Berlin and there is no force within Germany that would allow to break down this deep dependency. Although, of course, it is not that in Germany today everyone is pleased with the vassalization or the treatment of the Germans as a junior partner by the United States.
3522	43	There should be a very deep geopolitical or geostrategic transformation in Europe, taking into account the military factor as well. I think it is theoretically possible, but it would require a greater armed conflict. And not necessarily in Europe, which is worth adding. I think such a conflict in the Indo-Pacific or in the Middle East could absolutely transform the system of forces in Europe. Not everything depends on us, the Poles, the Europeans. But everything could turn back if there was really a big war in the Middle East. The hypothetical attack of Israel on Iran – hypothetical, but quite likely given the declaration of Israeli politicians such as Naftali Bennett, Jair Lapid or Gen. Aviv Kohavi; the blockade of the Ormuz coast, the paralysis of communication through the Oman Bay, the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, would have such a huge impact on the world economy that different types of allies, geopolitical systems would also be transoriented. Possible U.S.-China conflict in the South China Sea, in the Eastern China Sea, in the Taiwan Coast. Of course, all this can change this situation.
3522	45	In Poland, in order to remove this U.S. dependency, it would first and foremost be necessary to eliminate the current special services. I have no least doubts about this. Option zero from special services, in the intelligence agency, in the internal security agency, etc. Practically, military services were removed from the armed forces, because in time of peace they are not in the armed forces. So the question, why are the military services? It would seem to create a new national intelligence agency, a new counterintelligence service. The name is now irrelevant, this is a secondary matter. And, of course, the judgment of the guilty of such subordination to a foreign power. Condemning those people who are responsible for the CIA’s secret prisons, condemning those people who took part in the involvement of Poland in war in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was absolutely unnecessary. Of course, it requires very deep geopolitical changes to happen, but this is not excluded.
3522	47	And who should educate these new services?
3522	49	“In the Polish Geostrategic Society we presented the project Strategy 4.0 for the Republic of Poland. We show there a certain concept that could take place in peaceful conditions. I am not talking about war conditions or some revolution in Poland now, but the normal situation, when there is a radical political change in Poland and this horizon of the decade is given to us and we can actually do it on the basis of the downstream structures. I watched the WSI verification and I know how it can be done. Absolutely not in two weeks, not in two months, not even in two years. Within ten years we can create serious, counting special services in Europe. Instead, this requires a huge political mobilization, a downward and above all radical political change, the removal of the circular system from power in Poland.
3522	51	As a result of the events in Ukraine, a change in the nationality structure is made in Central-Eastern Europe, and in particular in Poland. Is this a targeting process? If so, who is behind it and what is its purpose?
3522	53	“This change in the structure of nationality is ongoing and this is visible with an empty eye. We know perfectly how a small group of Ukrainian citizens have been granted as a refugee. We know that the majority of these citizens have no refugee status and that a large portion of people from Ukraine have arrived in Poland from areas where no direct war activities are carried out. So this causes us to ask the question: do we not deal with an organized move action? If so, in whose interest?
3522	55	If we look at who is most loud today behind the creation of Ukraine – the Polish-Ukrainian Union – then we see that they are pro-American, pro-Atlantic environments. The atmospheres called the Atlantic are widespread. This consists of the whole concept of the so-called. The triangle, the formation of a sanitary cordon between Germany and Russia. And there is no doubt for me that in the interest of the widely understood Anglo-Saxon forces is the transformation of Poland into a multi-national, multi-confessional state, a state where national identity will be divided, where it will be some form of federation, where this political factor of Poland will be very strongly weakened.
3522	57	Some hope gives the fact that many Poles did not get to the narrative flowing from the mainstream media. You meet these people traveling throughout the country with lectures. Who are the organizers and participants of the meeting?
3522	59	– These are very people of different professions: entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors, academic teachers, students, high school students, teachers, physical workers, etc. It is also worth paying attention to people who listen to my podcast on the internet. This is a huge social breakthrough, including Polish environments, Polish people in the east, as well as various organizations in Poland that cannot take a vote for example. officials of the state. I know that my podcasts are heard at the MSZ, MON, MSW, the President's Office or the Prime Minister's Office, etc. Because people know perfectly that what the media are giving is not related to reality; it is not related to what is happening in the halls at the Sukhai Alei, Ujazdovsky Alei or the Krakow Suburbs. I also worked at the President's Office and I know how the media was, and how it looked from the scenes. So I realize that this hunger of truth, or simply a different view and discussion, is very large. You may not agree with me, but I think the intellectual exchange itself, the exchange of opinions is very important and people appreciate it very much.
3522	61	In your geopolitical subcast on YouTube, you almost every day move topics related to conflicts or wars that are taking place in the most diverse corners of the world. Where is the most important struggle in the world? In what extent does this conflict affect us, the Poles?
3522	63	The struggle is multi-dimensional. The most important struggle is about the future of the human species itself and takes place in the minds of all of us, a broadly understood noussphere, from the Greek nous, that is, the reason. So this information and psychological sphere is absolutely the most important. For this is both transhumanism, and posthumanism, and a very deep interference in the genome of man, and this is how the human species should look over 50 years.
3522	65	There is a struggle for the future of civilization, as civilization in Europe should look. We are talking very much about the Western civilization, the collective West. But what is it really? This is not synonymous with the Latin Civilization of the Final Felix. We’re going to have a no longer living sp. Today, the United States or the United Kingdom is a Latin civilization. Absolutely not. Like the Germans, which in some aspects are also far from the Byzantine civilization today.
3522	67	And, of course, there is a struggle for power in the world, which is going not so straightforward that between one or another country, but is going asymmetrically between multinational corporations, between unformalized interest groups, between large investment funds. Let’s look at the role today of such investment funds as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, which have a much greater power than most countries in the world. Let’s look at corporations such as Meta, Amazon, Microsoft or Google, which have great power, and social media based in the United States are absolutely punishable in Poland.
3522	69	And finally the struggle between traditional powers is practically for a new vision of the world. On the one hand, to stop the liberal hegemony, on the other hand, to the police world. States such as China, India, Russia, Turkey, the Republic of Macedonia, Brazil, Argentina or Iran are interested in a police-centered world where a new division of influence zones will develop. The United States, of course, is forining its liberal hegemony, to dominate the world and impose its own civilizational matrix on it.
3522	71	I think a certain vision of Latin civilization should be here a roadmap for understanding what the cultural sovereignty is and what the struggle is focused on today. It’s not just about tanks, aircraft, but above all about human consciousness, because this is the most important field of battle. And by understanding this, we must realize that the foundation of cultural sovereignty is certain identity. First of all, the civilizational identity, which consists of specific values, but also the national identity.
3522	73	In our case, when it comes to Latin civilization, there is no better theoretical perception than it was done by Felix Finny. This civilizational factor is here the “five-mith” of being, which combines such values as: good, truth, health, well-being, beauty.
3522	75	First of all, it is necessary to maintain civilian identity, national identity. To educate, to educate, and to educate again, using the maximum number of resources, but not those prosystemal or desystemal, but just those downward and independent. And of course to organize from the bottom, to have that awareness that in our closest environment there are conscious, valuable people who, if the time of breakthrough comes, will be able to take the gloves.
3522	77	We realize that not everything depends on us. If we had to compare today’s A.D. 2022 to the First World War, then we can argue here whether we were in 1914 or in 1916. The fact is that we are in a period of very great stress, and like the Poles at the time, or even the national movement at the time, we should create the downward initiative of organic work, work at the foundation, so that in the situation when this historical moment of breakthrough really comes, when it will be possible to beat ourselves to full independence, to full sovereignty, so that we will then have staff.
3522	79	Precious advice, however, I feel that too many people simply don’t want and even don’t care about it. At the same time, the puppy takes the matter seriously. Is this guy able to change something?
3522	81	History does not change the masses. The history is changed by a minority, but the minority is determined and organized. This is the answer to your question. Here it is not about having a whole mass of people today who suddenly begin to be interested in geopolitics, defence, etc. No. Controversy of the future is needed. And nowadays it is necessary to create the contrelites of the future, on the basis of the network from the bottom to build an organized and determined minority.
3522	83	Thank you for the conversation.

3523	5	SUTENERS at the Polish Consulate in LUCK will deliver visits to prostitutes
3523	7	Polish Ministry of Agency Affairs
3523	9	The agency doesn’t like to be seen. Where it is least needed, there is it. But why? A naive question. Where you don’t see it, there’s the best. The poor Peerel's security agents are also people. They have to live with something. In the mother country they have a huge competition that it is hard to survive. In the first place, Russian agents are spread around the world. They have priority. Let someone try to resist it immediately commits suicide. Sometimes even collective, it is even aircraft. Can the Russian authorities stand in the Polish counter-interviews? or for example. in Ukrainian? Why not? I will answer the question.
3523	11	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the leadership of the “dooring watah” “Radka” Sikorsky is in this “dooring” still part one large agency of secretaries and covans. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, i.e. officials of the highest level, diplomats at various high chairs. They can’t fall from high tables unless they’re on the bands. Radek is not going. They have good crew. But that such an unusual divorce soul usually for life already desires to heaven, and that is expensive, it must be earned. The “Diplomas” are the “Diplomas”. In the capital of the Hungarian Polish Volynia, Lucku also and for the “consultors” of the oldest professions in the world. Advice in this profession is always interesting. The benefit is the whole bag. The client is not a paid client. The client is not a client at all. The consultant also receives good “diengs” for the services.  
3523	13	The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs is smart. What happened to the Eastern media’s cash as the government took over them? Where did the money spent on the radio? I’m going to ask Mr. Rick. This is the question of the Lion. And after the battle it is: Give a fleet, for the river will float you. And what? And nothing. No fleets. She went on joint diplomatic payments, a subterranean walk.
3523	15	Even to the Radio of Lviv something was awarded in the future for 2013 – unconsulate – the Polish ration of unstain. For as on the Ukrainian waves something will scream to the Yanukovychs and other meres about the ministerial alfonsistic profession of our diplomats, the diengs to the end of the PO are not budiet. What is Buddha? Amber gold, amber gold, amber gold, amber gold
3523	17	This is the bad Radio of the Lions of... feared and let the writings of the journalists, what is the ministry of national shame flags explode and uncleanly alphonsize them electronically.  And the writer, the writer, the longer you write, the further you wake up and give them more smatriet.”
3523	19	In Poland, suterism (as suterism and couplerism) is a crime described in the article. 204 § 2 of the Criminal Code, threatened by a punishment of up to 3 years of imprisonment (or a punishment of up to 10 years if the prostitute is a minor). This is a crime in many countries of the world.
3523	21	"The criminals who have difficulty with sutenerism are called suteners, or subsequently alphons. This last term comes from the main character published in 1873 in the novel of Alexander Dumas (Son). Mr. Alphonse, who tried this procedure. Previously, the sutener in the criminal slang was defined by the word ""luj"", which in turn came from the French version of the name Louis (Louis)."
3523	23	This also means that every eleven active today diplomat III of the Republic of Poland, who works outside Poland, cooperated with civil or military (WSI) services of the Republic of Poland. There are seven ambassadors or consulates in this group, and therefore persons leading the Polish diplomatic establishments.

3523	43	Here is the question
3523	45	With sincere honesty the data about the diplomats enforced in peerlovsk ministry provided by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gražina Bernatovich, probably forced by shame mixed with the color that no longer wants to leave the emblem – “door the watah” of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Radoslav Sikorsky. M in. indicates :
3523	47	Schengen visas to France, Denmark, or Germany were granted to persons suffering from irregularities, subject to the prohibition of entrance to those countries. Ukrainian citizens were forced to pay the charges for the provision of visas. Through the border illegally transported children...in the consulate of the Republic of Luchka in Ukraine operated a shayka directed by former Esbek, and covered by the Polish special services...we arrived to Ukraine, which sought a visa legally, but was forced to pay the charter...the BOR officer informed me... that my invitation does not mean anything and that on this basis I will not get a visa... with a reference to “Mr. People”. I went there... the conversation with me started from the amount of 400-500 euros...”
3523	49	“In the night they prepare documents, bring to trusted people in concrete windows. It’s not just visa trading. The card is sold for 700 euros. You can find advertisements in the city and on the Fecebook. There are also visas (based on fictional invitations). The Consulate Paradise for Prostitutes.
3523	51	The procedure is carried out under the supervision of the consul Sylvester Szostak, who oversee the issuance of visas in the consulate (“Gazeta Polska” 8 August 2012).
3523	53	Bernatovich said that about 60% of people working in the Polish diplomacy are subject to mirrors.
3523	55	Why 60% of Polish diplomats have not been dismissed before the service - Bernatovich did not inform the Polish and global public.
3523	57	The fact of employment in the Polish diplomacy of the Peerel's Security Service's collaborators was revealed during the summit meeting of the Foreign Affairs Commission. The information on the current state of employment in the MSZ was presented by officials and secret collaborators of the Communist Special Services during the meeting of the Commission by the members of Law and Justice.
3523	59	Minister Grażyna Bernatowicz has tried to convince the members of the commission that the qualifications have a crucial importance on employment in Polish diplomacy. During his speech, Bernatovich did not specify what qualifications it was about. Only moral?
3523	61	Members of the committee learned from Bernatovich that the personal policy in MSZ is carried out in accordance with the law and the principles of human resources management, where the most important criterion is the possession of appropriate meritory competences.
3523	63	The question arises, is cooperation with the Communist Intelligence, or subsistence, sufficient diplomatic qualifications in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?
3523	65	Diplomates enforced for the trade of visas for Ukrainian prostitutes cultivated supernatural – taking profit from the cultivation of prostitution by another person.
3523	67	This is usually associated with prostitution (a tendency to cultivate prostitution) and couplerism (a facilitation to cultivate prostitution), and sometimes with other crimes such as human trafficking and the use of threats and violence against prostitutes. In addition to individual supporters, it is one of the fields of activity that are engaged by organized criminal groups.
3523	69	Bernatovich noted that none of the law orders employers dismissal, or unemployed employees who have made a true illustrative statement. She acknowledged that removing from the foreign service persons who have admitted to cooperation in their declarations is difficult from a legal point of view.
3523	71	by Dr Hab. Krzysztof Szczerski, former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Director of the Institute of Political Sciences of the Jagiellonian University is not surprised by the number given by Bernatovich secret collaborators, which confirmed his opinion on the personal policy of Minister Radoslav Sikorsky, guided by the principle ofining the status quo on the leadership positions in his department. Minister Sikorsky prefers people of the PRL-ovsky family, although he himself becomes the hotest opponent of communism.
3523	73	Christophe Szczerski believes that people who were engaged on the side of the Communist state should not work in the diplomacy III of the Republic of Macedonia today. Such people served this to make Poland a country slave by the Soviet Union, a country chewed in all respects. According to him, people associated with the PRL special services, and currently employed in the MSZ, due to their devotion to the Communist authorities, should not be treated today as normal officials. Meanwhile, in the MSZ, led by Radosław Sikorski, such persons are not only tolerated, but rather preferred – and almost a quarter of a century has passed since the fall of communism, says Krzysztof Szczerski.
3523	75	Bernatovich, on the other hand, is convinced that the people who were collaborators of Peerel's security services and now occupy high state positions in Polish diplomacy are professionals who cannot be discriminated and for a long period of life have witnessed devotion to that country we have today!
3523	77	Bernatovich in his summit statement did not indicate the amounts that the Polish cross-media did not receive, nor the reasons why otherwise the millions of funds allocated to the annual, defined goal ofining the Polish media in Kresach, including the Radio of the Lviv.
3523	79	As a result of the dissolution of the Committee of State Security (Comité Gosudarstwiennoj Biezopastnosti) known as the KGB of the USSR in October 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union two months later (August 1991), a powerful intelligence and security service system remained.
3523	81	It is estimated that in the 1980s, more than 400 thousand people worked in the KGB of the USSR, including 230-250 thousand in the border forces and about 50 thousand in the unit of communication and the protection and service of the Kremlin. The KGB of the USSR had several hundred thousand informers among the population and in the rounds of government and armed forces.
3523	83	The KGB offices (residents) of the USSR operated in all the capitals of the world under the cover of the USSR consulate or the USSR embassy, or simply as missions and commercial companies.
3523	85	After the dissolution of the KGB, the USSR was transitionally operating from September 1991 to December 1991 the Central Intelligence Service, which was transformed by the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin No. 293 from December 18, 1991 into the Foreign Intelligence Service (SWR). It was established by the Ministry of Security in 1991.
3523	87	The Foreign Intelligence Service of the USSR took over the tasks previously performed by the I General Directorate of the KGB of the USSR (PGU), engaged in foreign intelligence.
3523	89	The main task of SWR is, among other things. To provide the President and the Government of the Russian Federation with political, economic, technical, scientific, analytical and information about the states, organizations, people, about everything that is important for the conduct of effective policy by the President, the Prime Minister and the Government of the Russian Federation.
3523	91	The SWR officials act as diplomats, officials without diplomatic immunity. illegals covered by journalists, tourists, etc. For this purpose, they use ambassades, Russian consulates spread around the world and (illegal) various companies and organizations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the main task of the Russian intelligence was to eliminate the scientific and technical gap between Russia and NATO countries.
3523	93	The initiative of the Foreign Intelligence Service was not very successful. In a very short time between 1991 and 1992, five high-ranking officers fled to the West from the foreign offices of the SWR in Italy, the UK, Belgium, Finland and France. On the occasion, they took, of course, with themselves the most secret documents, even from the service of the First Glaucoma KGB of the USSR.
3523	95	The Foreign Intelligence Service has taken over a large number of KGB intelligence agents. The most important co-operator of the SWR, which was still banned by the KGB of the USSR, was among others. Earl Edwin Pitts, an FBI officer working in the New York counterintelligence department.
3523	97	It was nominated by the KGB between 1987 and August 1989. After nine years of cooperation with the Russian intelligence, he was arrested by the FBI in 1996.
3523	99	The second intelligence agent, which the SWR of the Russian Federation inherited after the KGB of the USSR, was a 16-year-old Central Intelligence Agency worker, Harold Nicholson. He was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in November 1996.
3523	101	How many other KGB crackers have left in the CIA or the FBI and other services around the world, it will be revealed over time. Until 1996, SWR used the data collected by the Connected Data Processing System (SOUD). This year, he took part of his competences, sharing them with FAPSI.
3523	103	One of the most valuable agents taken by the SWR from the KGB was undoubtedly Aldrich Ames. He offered his services on 16 April 1985 to a resident of the KGB in Washington.
3523	105	To prove to the Russians that this is not another provocation of the U.S. counterintelligence (FBI), he issued to them two KGB officers camped by the CIA in Moscow.
3523	107	On June 13, 1985, Ames gave the KGB the names of all officers of the KGB, GRU and other Eastern intelligence agencies that cooperated with the CIA that he was known. Thus, a network of agents built by the CIA for thirty years has turned into a cup of grace. For nine years of spying for the Soviet KGB and its successors, SWR, Aldrich Ames probably did everything the agent could do, except the foundation of a truck under the CIA headquarters in Langley and the export of documents from it.
3523	109	Ames revealed more than a hundred secret operations, issued to the Russians more than 30 people working with the CIA (of which ten were sentenced to death and shot down) and other Western agencies.
3523	111	Aldrich Ames gave it to the KGB. Sergei Fiedorenko, Soviet diplomat at the United Nations.
3523	113	"Sergey Fiedorenko worked for the CIA under the pseudonym ""Pyrrhic"" until he was released by Ames in 1985. Feeling the danger fled to the United States, he is probably living somewhere in the United States to date."
3523	115	"Adolf Tołkaczev under the pseudonym ""Vanquish"" provided CIA information about the latest MiG aircraft, mainly deployment systems and so-called. Stealth technology. The kidnapped by Ames was arrested and lost."
3523	117	"Sergey Motorin, the KGB major under the pseudonym ""Gauze"", worked with the CIA informing about the KGB operations carried out in the U.S. capital. Ames was arrested by the KGB in August 1985, and lost."
3523	119	"General Mr. Dmitry Polakov, a senior officer of the GRU military intelligence, has worked with the CIA under the pseudonym ""Tophat"" or ""Roam"", for more than 20 years providing unprecedented information. Released by Amesa in 1985, he was arrested in June 1986 and lost."
3523	121	Aldrich Ames was arrested by the FBI on February 21, 1994 and sentenced to life imprisonment.
3523	123	A very loud case was the arrest on February 20, 2001 by the FBI counterintelligence department Robert Hanssen, a long-term FBI official. Hanssen signed into a Soviet trade company in New York in late 1979. He then told the Soviet military GRU secret materials.
3523	125	He was caught by his wife, hiding secret documents at home (she thought it was love letters). She told her husband to go to confession immediately.
3523	127	Hanssen, obtaining a warmth (the money received from the Russians had to give for charity) from a familiar pastor, broke contacts with the GRU, the Soviet military intelligence.
3523	129	He again contacted the Soviet intelligence, this time with the KGB, on 1 October 1985, sending a letter to the embassy in Washington, and then calling there, offering his own services. For 15 years of cooperation with the KGB, he received $1.4 million in cash and brilliants.
3523	131	For information that allowed Robert Hanssen to be arrested, the FBI paid $6 million. In the materials compromising Hanssen were among others. The caset with a phone recording that Hanssen made to the Soviet Embassy in 1985 offering his services, photos from a hidden camera showing Hanssen during the receipt of the money left by an officer leading in the so-called. The dead contact box, and a piece of plastic bag in which Hanssen delivered secret materials to the KGB, with his fingerprints.
3523	133	Robert Hanssen was sentenced to life imprisonment and the whole case led to the resignation of the then director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI, Louise Freeh.
3523	135	The SWR’s headquarters is located in Moscow in the district of Jasienovo and has 27 radio stations located mainly in the country’s capital, e.g. Paris, London, Washington, Berlin, operating as part of the Russian Embassy or Consulates. The Foreign Intelligence Service has its own so-called The School of Spy. The number of employees employed in the first years of activity is estimated to be 15,000.
3523	137	Russian President Vladimir Putin has launched a reform of the Russian intelligence, counterintelligence and security services. The Federal Security Service (FSB) is to be transferred to the Ministry of Public Security and to restore control over the Foreign Intelligence Service (SWR) and the Federal Protection Service (FSO) – the corresponding Polish BOR.
3523	139	In the intelligence and press circles it was said that Putin sought to unite all security institutions. The aim was to restore the influence of special services on the KGB model.
3523	141	 Russian officials in the Polish counterinterview. A few months ago, a visit of representatives of the Russian special services took place at the headquarters of the Military Contrast Intelligence Service. In the SKW area they entered a service car that was not previously checked by the Poles – reports Dorota Kania “Gazeta Polska Codzienne” on 9 October 2012.
3523	143	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hides agents, former collaborators of the PRL special services from the consulate in Lucka in connection with the above-defined visa affair – reports Jacek Dytkowski “Our Journal” on 4 October 2012.
3524	1	Is there a future for the House of Lula?
3524	3	Due to the election in Brazil, I remind you of the text originally published in March 2022 on Strajk.eu, at the very early stage of this campaign. Of course, a lot has happened during this time, for example. Sergio Moro resigned from his nomination. However, I remind the text due to the currentity of many questions and speculations on the near future of Brazil.
3524	5	The most important elections in the world are to be held in 2022 in Brazil – the first tour in October. Brazil is the second (after the United States) most populated country in the Western Hemisphere (221 million people), the fifth most populated country in the world and one of the largest formal democracies. It is the largest (in any way) country in Latin America. But they will also be important because the Brazilians will make a considerable decision on the fate (more) of the world for the near future.
3524	7	Until quite recently, for a few years, Brazil has been a great world player, climbing the hill of economic importance (to the sixth place on the list of the largest economies), to this authentic and ambitious diplomatic power. The first letter of the short, with which great hopes were linked: B in the BRICS. Brazil, under the rule of the first president of the working class, Luli da Silvy, the leader of the Labour Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT), in the years 2003-2011, was the hope of the left worldwide. Engaged in the real improvement of the existence of tens of millions of the poorest Brazilians from one, and in the ambitious projects of international cooperation from the other. Let us call this power camp (just without power) the House of Lula.
3524	9	The Fall of the House of Lula
3524	11	Today it’s not hard to say when Brazil’s so perceived importance has reached a fairly raptous end. This can lead to one, though extended during the event: the impeachment of President Dilmy Rousseff, from the House of Lula. Under the burden of political attacks and economic problems, the House of Luli gradually, but rather quickly, denied its commitment to rebuilding the world outside. He was no longer concerned with internal affairs. It fell at the end of August 2016.
3524	13	Brazil was again in the hands of the right-wing, neoliberal and obscene conservative behind a single attack; determined to reverse all the social progress made under the rule of the House of Lula and to replace the costs of the economic crisis, deepened by the anti-corruption operation Lava Jato (“car bath”). It hit the state oil giant Petrobras and the entire construction industry (in its center was the Odebrecht Group); only in those two, living not so long, industries led to the liquidation hundreds of thousands of jobs. After the short office of Michel Temer, who pulled Rousseff out of the table – the office that was too transitional and as a slide to become another House – the house of Bolsonaro entered the concrete-wire communist palaces of Niemeyer in Brazil. In addition to its interest in social progress, Brazil has also denied the right line in international affairs to the House of Lula: assertive to the United States, expressed on international forums from the BRICS, through Mercosur and CELAC, to the UN. Brazil has returned to the role of obedient client and washal of Washington.
3524	15	"The fall of the House of Lula in 2016 was a key moment for the rejection of Latin America’s left under the sign of the “right wave” by the right-wing reaction. “Rose” because it is ambitious, but not “red”, not communist. The “Red Wave” tried to act within the framework of what is possible under the conditions of the global neoliberal order. It was key because it was easier to defeat the left at the power in the smaller and weaker countries after the neighbor, defeating it in the largest Brazil. When Jeanine Áñez was formed in La Paz, the Ambassador of the House of Bolsonaro was in the same room. The creation of Juan Guaidó's ""true"" leader in Venezuela would also not happen with the stable House of Lula in the Palace of Planalto in Brazil. For the dark few years the only victory of the left in the region was the conquest of power in Mexico by Lopez Obrador, but here the direction of change is changing again (Bolivia, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Honduras...). If the House of Lula soon returned to power in Brazil, it would give a chance for a long-term reversal of the trends throughout the region."
3524	17	Lula’s presidential candidacy is not yet official [not at the beginning of March when this text was published], but it seems natural – Lula is in any way the most popular politician of the 21st century, and that’s on a global scale. As in 2018 it was said that only he can overcome the right, so now it is said that only he can withdraw from the power of the House of Bolsonaro. But in 2018 it was not enough.
3524	19	The Structure of Brazil
3524	21	A few explanations about the systemic principles of the largest republic in the south of the Caribbean. The elections are held every four years and are simultaneously presidential, to the National Congress (composed from lower chambers and senates) and to state authorities (Brazil has a federal system) and local. On the same day, plus the second presidency tour closer to the end of the year. As historian Perry Anderson once noted, the state of this great country is based on a mix of two models of liberal democracy: the American presidential system and the European Parliamentary Parliamentary Democracy. The result is that, on the one hand, it is apparently, nominally strong, elected in direct voting, the presidential administration (as in the US, the presidential candidate starts with his potential vice president, as the duet are already exposed in the election campaign), without the office of the prime minister, based on a complex mozaic of the party in parliament, of which none is never big enough to rule independently. Parties in the National Congress can be more than twenty. The result of such an agreement is, on the one hand, immanent corruption (“buy” votes in other parties to implement legislation), and on the other hand, eternal obstruction of the progress of any real change. Related to each other, corruption and obstruction are the foundation of the interests of the terribly rich oligarchic dynasties. They hold the majority of the country’s resources (from land, through the banks and industry, through the media, and thus the control of the social opinion) and under such conditions they almost always find a way to forge or defend their interests.
3524	23	The presidential mandate runs in a synchronic way with the parliament's mandate, therefore it is impossible to make uneven mandates imposed on the head of state and the legislature, as in Poland. The chancellor will run in the scheduled calendar, even if the president does not reach the office until its end – because he will die or be removed, like Rousseff. Then the first office in the state, like in the United States, takes over by his/her vice president until the end of his/her term (this authority took over by Temer, although he never had more than one-digit support).
3524	25	In Brazil, the limit of two seats in the country’s highest office applies only to the number of seats in a row. In principle – although this has never happened – he does not exclude the possibility of becoming president for the third time, provided that after a break. So Lula has the right to apply for a job again in this system – but what are the chances of success? He conducted surveys, but in 2018 he also conducted surveys – and that’s why he was removed from the race, putting him in prison during the campaign campaign. The accusations were sfabricated, they were removed, but Lula was released from prison only when the modernist palaces of Niemeyer in Brazil entered the Bolsonaro House. The Brazilian oligarchy then showed that it was ready for (just?) To prevent the left from returning to power.
3524	27	House of Bolsonaro
3524	29	When Bolsonaro took power in 2019, many of his frightened Brazilians (including my friends) counted to be able to hit him by the same method of impeachment that the right was removed from Rousseff’s power. Bolsonaro has an extremely negligent attitude to democratic standards and procedures, glorifying the period of military dictatorship 1964-1983, against him and his closest were conducted direct criminal investigations. It could be believed that there will be both reasons and procedural bases. However, nothing like this has happened. The oligarchic policy of such instruments uses only against the left, not against the representatives (or figurants) of their own interests.
3524	31	And something else happened. If you believe in the Argentine radio, it was two years ago that Bolsonaro was silently removed from the actual power by the high-ranking military, who have long been the thief of the Bolsonaro House. The government in Buenos Aires had similarly received from Brazil messages that it is actually ruling from the back seat General Walter Braga Netto, officially then head of the Staff Bolsonaro, today the Minister of Defense.
3524	33	Some say Lula is the only one who can defeat the Bolsonaro House. Are they considering that the oligarchs don’t want Bolsonaro to be in power at all? They did not withdraw him from power, despite the fact that since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Brazil, all oligarchic media (other in Brazil are not or are irrelevant) united to the criticism of the president – Emir Sader, judging historical precedents, returned from this coming state attack. In the 21st century, however, everything happens in similar structures as before, but in playful scenarios there are unexpected movements of elements. These moves are intended to mask the nature of things before being manipulated in new ways by the audience. Instead of removing it, they left it as a clown on the first line: its scratches attract all attention and possible anger (e.g. to the failure of the state against the pandemic), and allow them to still quietly steal behind closed doors. Last but not least, they did not remove it because it was a pedestrian of the Trump House (representing the same model of right-wing excentrism). The Brazilian oligarchy works in alliance with the American Empire, never contrary to its will. Her motto is: “What is good for the United States is good for Brazil” (for it is good for the oligarchs). But Trump is no longer in the White House. The House of Obama returned to power, though in another person Joe Bidena (because in the largest republic north of the Caribbean the limit of two mandates is counted for a lifetime).
3524	35	In 2020, I wrote on Strajk.eu that for the oligarchs Bolsonaro was never a choice from conviction, but only from the “absence of lack” (incomprehensible and quite likely confused, represents a huge risk even for “his own”). To remove it, you must first have someone to replace it. Since, in the current event of the historical tragedy of Brazil, the oligarchs are trying to play their interests with the preservation of the formal theater of liberal democracy, they must have someone sufficiently popular – or cultivate it for themselves. I speculated then that Sérgio Moro could potentially be such a man. A cynic judge from Kuritiba was the head of the Lava Jato operation, which ended the House of Lula, and he also put Lula himself in jail when he threatened to win against Bolsonaro. Then he became the star of the administration of Bolsonaro as his minister of justice, and even a little later they disputed and dispersed politically. Today Moro is mentioned in surveys and has already support ranging between 6 and 8%, the last time I checked. This means that the operation to launch him on the potential next president of the oligarchs has already begun. He himself, with his sick ambition, would be extremely good to the ego if he had succeeded in the life of both Lula and Bolsonaro. The case is fatally serious.
3524	37	Lawfare and other misfortunes
3524	39	As he took power in 2003, Lula was fully aware that the United States is a massive threat to the leftist project in Brazil. This was the main reason for the pressure placed by the House of Lula on the arms and development of the army, it was an explanation of its disruptions in the Amazon region (Brazil is there open to an American attack from the territory of their client Colombia), etc. However, the House of Luli made a mistake seeing the U.S. threat in too external, strict spatial categories, its presence within the Brazilian social life seeing only in the issues of finance and capital ownership. The House of Luli did not appreciate the degree of American infiltration of different levels of Brazilian social and political life; he did not understand that behind Obama’s smile congratulating Luli that he is the most popular politician in the world, is the continuation of the line taken after the House of Bush.
3524	41	"Brian Mier and Daniel Hunt are the authors of the book Year of Lead: Washington, Wall Street and the New Imperialism in Brazil (“The Year of Lead: Washington, Wall Street and the New Imperialism in Brazil”) and the founders of Brazil Wire; Mier is also the correspondent of TeleSur in Brazil. The authors are convinced that Lava Jato was not motivated by the best wishes of the beginning, a sincere anti-corruption operation that was dissolved and captured by the right as a tool of political struggle against the House of Lula. From the beginning with such intentions it was designed, and it was so far from the beginning that even anti-corruption changes in the law that allowed it, were the Brazilians suffered by the U.S. Department of Justice. With whom Moro himself passed a mysterious training in the early period. Moro then appears at all stages of a massive attack on the House of Lula conducted by the methods of enemy media campaigns and lawfare. Lawfare is a war by law. The reactive practice consists in the fact that apparently neutral, “technical” legal instruments are used as instruments of fighting (in practice always leftist) political opponent. Moro initiated Lava Jato, brought them to the end, stood behind the crossing to the media of the investigation material, including the manipulated, scattered fragments of the recordings of Lula's subsequent conversations with Rousseff, in the key moments of political campaigns (election and impeachmeant). We recently learned that he was also behind unverified testimony burning Rousseff's right-wing magazine ""Veja"" when the president sought to be re-elected in 2014. When in the prize for all of this, Bolsonaro awarded him the post of Minister of Justice, obviously it did not exhaust his ambitions. His collapse with Bolsonaro and his departure from the administration can be interpreted by the fact that he did not want to drown together with the “Trump of the Tropics” when the “Trump of the Tropics” eventually compromised. This would damage Moro's chances of reaching the highest positions in the country."
3524	43	The case is deadly serious, because the House of Obama, the same who destroyed the Dilm, is again at power in the Empire in the north. The House of Obama, who in the plunging, hidden state attack on the House of Lula has put so much effort, so many years of work, on so many fronts. Because lawfare and Lava Jato should be seen in combination with other components of the system. Some of them: Temer was a long-term informator of the U.S. Embassy; the U.S. Ambassador arrived in Brazil from Asunción, immediately after a similar parliamentary attack took place in the smaller Paraguay; in the campaigns targeted in the House of Lula, the U.S. internet giants were actively involved; Bolsonaro, immediately after taking power, managed to make a vassal visit to the CIA headquarters in Washington.
3524	45	What next?
3524	47	"The matter is deadly serious, because both the oligarchs on the site and the House of Obama in the north, after so many years of efforts, can be truly determined to finally remove this violator of their interests once and for all. The Spanish newspaper ""El País"" cited in February the former judge of the Supreme Court of Brazil, Joaquim Barbos, who warns that Lula's life is in danger. Barbosa says this, not even being Luli’s ally – he himself has locked several PT politicians in prison. In the event of Lula’s death, Bolsonaro and Moro would enter the second round, and then it could be replaced by an excentric variant by a man who remains a representative of the interests of the oligarchy and the Empire, but is not only calculable, but even deserved as the one who can “drive results”."
3524	49	This time Lula is sure to realize the seriousness of the situation. How do you try to overcome such obstacles? When he came to power at the beginning of the century, he signed a kind of pact with the oligarchs of agriculture, industry, finance and media. He promised to them that social progress will finance without affecting their interests: from economic growth and revenue from the raw material boom; that the growing internal market will still be paid to them; that the neoliberal fundamentals will not lose their sacred place in the general economic order, they will only get the human face. But even in such circumstances, they silently cried long-term conspiracy with the Americans, if only the president-robot and his left-wing government were the one-time choice of history. When the raw boom ended and Brazil began (with a few years of delay) to reach the consequences of the global economic collapse, they passed to a decisive offensive, composed of lawfare and coordinated media attack, led by Globo (one of the two largest media conglomerates in Latin America).
3524	51	What will Lula and his House do with this knowledge now? Do you act as if you didn’t know? Or will they decide to throw out the direct challenge to the oligarchs and the structure of property, through which they have almost the whole country in possession, at the expense of the general society? Will the oligarchs propose a new pact? If they drop the challenge openly already in the election campaign, the oligarchs can put a point over and, eventually dominating this over the time of the extended state attack, to bring after the body of Lula, together with the Americans, to Planalto the judge Moro, in a reward for his loyalty, reversibility and everything he did to finish the House of Lula. If he proposes a new pact, they will stand on it only if they feel that this time they keep it in shock and under full control, neutralized.
3524	53	Posts after time (October 2022): Judge Moro withdrew from the campaign, which does not mean he will not try in the future – and that he will not have the support of the Brazilian oligarchy and the Americans. If he returned this time, there should be no sufficient belief around him that he will win. But this may also confirm what I concluded with my March text: the House of Luli silently signed a new pact with the oligarchs, sufficiently convincing for the oligarchs themselves to believe that they will have everything under control, that nothing threatens them, and the government will be more predictable than the Bolsonaro administration. I pointed out that PT signed such a pact, is the start-up duet with Lula vice-president candidate, Geraldo Alckmin, a neoliberal “extreme centralist”, even if the party, from the arm of which he was the governor of São Paulo, is called the Brazilian Socialist Party. In Brazil, the names of political parties are completely distracted from their programs or ideologies. If the oligarchs accept the victory of the Lula-Alckmin team and do not get to the army (as they have done so many times in history when with the will of the people they were not on the way), it is because they believe that the second half of this duet is a guarantee of their interests in the new administration. If the House of Lula does not have a plan of an independent anti-bolsonar pact, which Alckmin has to represent in administration (and best kept in secret before that party); if the House of Lula intends to rule according to the principles of holy compromise with the oligarchs, which were in force in the first two mandates of its authority – this time, under the conditions of the global economic crisis (and not, as before, the raw boom), its field of maneuver will be so small that it will be able to change only as much as it is necessary for everything to remain the old.
3525	1	Wladimir Czarzasty: 100 percent of voters say they are voting for the program. There is no other party.
3525	3	There are two stories about Poland. One is a conservative state of well-being and this is the story of PiS. The second is the modern state of well-being and is the story of the left. In one and the other countries they give bread. But only in one they give freedom, says Włodzimierz Czarzasty, the head of SLD.
3525	5	Will something happen in this campaign?
3525	7	I do not expect any unusual events. Do not expect that October 14 will change in a substantial way.
3525	9	Will not change?
3525	11	Particularly, before the elections, politicians say things that are unfounded. The left does not do that because it tries to be rational. They don’t give money, they don’t promise that there will be a million houses ready in the morning. There will be neither a million, nor two million houses in the morning, nor even a hundred thousand. This cannot be done in one day and one night.
3525	13	It is possible to make Poland a country of prosperity. This was the promise of PiS President Jarosław Kaczyński in Sosnowc last Tuesday. This is the way you go to the seam.
3525	15	For now, we have two readable and accurate concepts of the story about Poland. One can be summarized with the words: a conservative state of well-being and that is the story of PiS. The second story is a modern state of well-being and this is the story of the left. In one and the other countries they give bread. But only in one they give freedom.
3525	17	If the government is willing to help the citizens, it should do so. He can do it wiser.
3525	19	In one they give 500+. In the second too?
3525	21	It is obvious. You know what the left has to do with this. Social postulates are known and the left will be the only guarantee in any government when it comes to social affairs. But let you finish my mind about these two concepts, two states. They are clear, because you can’t be a little behind freedom. You cannot be a little behind women’s rights. You cannot be a little behind the rights of partnerships. You cannot be a little behind a secular state. All of this “many” in Poland is over. Or someone has a precise view, or he swim, like on a boat, from one to the other. The Poles and the Poles see it. Back to the 500+, which you mentioned, we believe that if the state stands on to help citizens and citizens, it should do so. He can do it wiser.
3525	23	How?
3525	25	For example, the state gives 13 pensions. It is the case that it is given for two weeks before the election. Of course, I’m talking about it cynically and maliciously.
3525	27	of course.
3525	29	If the state gives “thirteen”, it’s good that it does. No one will take it. This systemically does not solve any problem. It would be much better to set the lowest pension at the level of $1,600 and not tax it. This would solve two problems. There would be no less than 1,600 euros. Secondly, it would equate the lowest pensions of women and men, because, I remind you, women have a systemic pension, 30 percent lower than men.
3525	31	The Scandal.
3525	33	So is. We offer systemic solutions, not just the distribution of money. We believe that system solutions are much more reasonable. In addition, we also consider it a scandal that when 13 pensions are given, it is said, “This is jark.” It would be “jark” if Mr. Jarek went to work, earned $10 billion, and then distributed them to retirees. In other cases, it is the money of the state for which you and I, and we all work.
3525	35	We give you what the Scripture gives you, and we give you what the Scripture has taken you. Can you explain it?
3525	37	This is already a classic statement, because on its basis, Mr. Schetyn tries to build his narrative, for example, saying that every time the data is, it is for ever data. Please very much. The words: “We give you what the PIS gives you” refers to the social sphere, and “We give you what the PIS has taken you” refers to the freedom sphere. I am talking here for example about the rights acquired for uniform services. We believe that the rights acquired should not be taken, regardless of whom they are concerned. If a state gives someone any rights, it cannot take them because the government in that state has changed, or it is governed by another party. Today, this is the case of uniforms. Tomorrow it will be about the soldiers, nottabene in the freezer lies such a law. Tomorrow it will be about prosecutors, judges, eventually teachers, and a hundred percent journalists. And these are the rights acquired, this is a serious matter; such actions are the weakening of the state.
3525	39	I'm going to go back to the election campaign - have you noticed some feedback?
3525	41	The campaign may have been and is without fireworks, but please note, it’s important what will happen after this campaign. No doubt, an event, a big event, is the common appearance of the left block. This is systematically important. Three generations agreed, the Poles and the Poles saw it and judging by the notes – and I am talking about it without arogance – appreciated it. This is a very important guide to the future. There is now a single leftist list in Poland, which for many years...
3525	43	... could not be done.
3525	45	Well, it was not possible. Therefore, we showed with Adrian and Robert that regardless of what we talked about ourselves in the past, regardless of how it was wrong between us, we could postpone all this and agree in the name of a greater matter. This is the event of this campaign.
3525	47	When you announced the coalition in July, you said it was just a preliminary love game. How do these relationships look today? Is this a block that will not break down after the election?
3525	49	This is a fooled block; after all, please note, it is also a pleasant block. This was seen during the TVN debate in which we watched the speech of Adrian Zandberg. But next to him stood Robert, the Włodek stood, the whole team stood. Despite the fact that the leaders of the Civil Coalition did not appear, I didn’t see Mr. Schetyn and Mrs. Kidawa-Blonny who would have the fingers for their representative and wish her very well.
3525	51	What do you think of Adrian Zandberg?
3525	53	well. But comparing this debate to what was four years ago has no sense. Adrian was a new, new four years ago. Now he is a formed policy with clear views, proposing clear solutions; one who knows where he is going and knows what he wants. I think we all have these characteristics. Our program is very transparent. A hundred percent of people who vote for us – and that’s objective, not our survey – say they’re voting for the program. “I’m loyal and determined to the program, so I’m going to go and vote for the left.” We have 100 percent mobilization of our electorate. There is no other party.
3525	55	Why do people want to vote for the left? What drives them, what are they going for? A secular state?
3525	57	The solutions we propose. of a secular state. Of course in social affairs. Of course, a specific historical policy. The whole sphere of cooperation and openness within the European Union. Certainly under guarantees for all social groups regardless of who comes from, who has the material status, who has the family status, who has the education. It is clear that people see what we propose to them in connection with the Constitution. We say: the state should provide for the benefit of citizens and citizens; these are benefits in the field of health, education, culture. The state may establish state enterprises to solve the problems of the residents of Poland, such as the state enterprise that builds apartments. We are convinced of that. As our respondents say that the market will solve these problems, we say: “Don’t say a mistake, because in Poland, 30 years after the transformation, there are 2 million houses missing.” If the market had to solve it, it would have solved it for a long time. I also think that the left is now well assessed because people see that we are fighting, that we want to fight, that we are determined. People also believe that other committees have already surrendered.
3525	59	You mean a civil coalition.
3525	61	There is no force in it. Strength is when the rain falls, when your shoes are soft, when you have wet socks and you wait for Adriana with Robert and keep the fingers behind him. That is strength. This is a small determination. The force is also the fact that we drive by bus from town to town and go out to people. It is that we leave at 3-4 a.m., and we return at 2 a.m. I think people see it.
3525	63	The decision of Mr. Gregor Schetyn regarding the fact that Mr. Małgorzata Kidawa-Blanska will be a candidate for the Prime Minister was not a force?
3525	65	Please the lady! The decision with Mrs. Kidawa-Blansk was a attempt to hide Mr. Gregor Schetyna. And so much. This served.
3525	67	Trying to hide for what reason?
3525	69	Notes fly on the lips on the neck. Then he was hiding. By the way, he was hiding for a moment, because what I open the TV is Gregor Schetyna who once and once announces something. It is he who decides who goes to the media, who doesn’t go, and how it is going to look. By your way, don’t you think it’s a bit undistant and a bit arrogant if it’s 23 percent in the notes and it’s indicated the composition of the government and the prime minister? Well, in order to indicate the prime minister, it is generally necessary to have a guarantee that there will be 50 percent plus one support. It seems to me that respecting the Public Platform does not go in that direction. And in this context, if you don’t think Mr. Schetyn should, for example, call Mr. Kosiniak-Kamys, or Mr. Zandberg, Biedronia, or Czarzaste and say: “Listen, if we go into the Sejm and we’ll have all together, as a democratic party, 50 percent plus one, then I have such an idea – Mr. Kidawa-Blansk to prime minister.” However, he will have to consult it.
3525	71	He urged the other coalitions, the weapons of God, not to go after the elections with PiS, so that they do not agree with PiS.
3525	73	Please you! It was so stupid! It was simple and stupid.
3525	75	Could it be that the thunderstorm is caught?
3525	77	This means that Grezesek Schetyna has no clear idea of the campaign. Please, on the electoral lists are Paul Kowal, Kazimier Ujazdovsky and Paul Poncillius. The Government of the Civil Platform was Mr. Jarosław Gowin and Mr. Michael Kamiński. So I say to you, O sinner, add these people! Close the gentlemen Poncillius, Kowal or Ujazdovsky so that they do not go to PiS after the elections. There are no people on the list of the left who were in the PiS. How can I treat it differently? How should I take this appeal seriously? This is the search for a substitute topic, because Mr. President Lech Wałęsa was on the PO convention on the invitation of Mr. Schetyna and said what he said.
3525	79	He has spoken about Kornel Morawiecki.
3525	81	Wales was on this convention because on the left was President Kwasnevsky. This is what they want to cover – Mr. Kwasnevsky’s visit to the left. And I will tell you funny - well and covered. The Lord of the Rings. This is the case of Mr. Neumann, uncomprehensible for the average recipient. Well, for three days he is defended and says nothing happened, the recording of the conversation took place two years ago. And suddenly it is said that he was guilty, but he is revoked from the head of the club. By the way, people feel that this is completely false because this club will still operate for only 3 days.
3525	83	This is not a punishment for Mr. Sławomir Neumann.
3525	85	What is the punishment? A few days ago there was a press conference in which the people of the left were urged to vote on those who were from the SLD, on people linked to the left who are in the Civil Coalition. By the way, it’s better that the cakes dry before the elections than they should dry in the Sejm. Please you! If it were the coalition of all democratic forces, it would be justified. There are blocks now. The left is here where it is, the PSL is here where it is, the same is with the Platform. I remember what the Platform did with the matter of partnerships and with the matter of abortion, as it was in the Sejm. These are simply things, in my opinion, unreadable for the citizen and the citizen. But I have good information - there is an alternative.
3525	87	So you present – on one run there is the PiS, on the other left, and in the middle as if there was nothing. And it is. PSL and the coalition as well.
3525	89	Well therefore. PSL is a male party. The last party, which can say, in some sense, is a class party. Not to mention that its tradition reaches the 19th century. But I ask you - if women are given freedom, they should therefore be free in all spheres: thinking, speaking, even in terms of their own body. There is only one country in the EU that does not allow abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy. So how can we say, “We are for women’s freedom, but on abortion rights the woman has no right?” How can we say about partnerships that it is better? At present, 30 percent of children in Poland are born in partnerships. It is necessary to regulate whether it is desired or not. Why escape this topic, why not put things clearly?
3525	91	It is one side of the medal. On the other hand, there is a global nationality trend that is linked to the Catholic trend. Do you not think that a secular state is too early for the Polish voters?
3525	93	Let me tell you about the trend of leaving the secular state in France. Or in Spain. in Portugal. Let’s talk about Ireland.
3525	95	In these countries, secularization has occurred for many years. It is inevitable for us, but it does not happen so quickly.
3525	97	Poland and no other country will escape progress. From medicine, from the development of science. No one will succeed. Once, since the 13th century, for centuries the prohibition of the delay section ruled. And Leonardo da Vinci and Michael Angel in the secret, they wanted to find out what we have inside. I guarantee you that it will not pass a year or two and the Church will accept in its doctrine as consistent with the teaching of the Church, in vitro. In vitro is to give life and happiness to people, not to take them. Moreover, please remember that what the Polish clergy is trying to do with the Polish Church is not the trend that Pope Francis shows. In Poland, the problem lies in the fact that the state loses its holy character, and PiS goes hand in hand with the Church, whose interests it also realizes in the financial sphere and does it in an untransparent way. The left is not against faith. We are not against the believers. But we are for the financing of the clergy to be transparent, and the clergy to pay taxes like other citizens. To pay the taxes, like other citizens. To pay the land tax, and has 160 thousand hectares and is the second land owner per country. To make money on your ZUSs; to introduce cash, for example. in the funeral.
3525	99	Do you see the future of Poland? What future?
3525	101	We will talk about the future day after the election. Each of the three parties must reflect on their own strategy. I am in favour of consolidation and cooperation. This is my opinion, but as the head of the SLD I have to consult with the statutory authorities of the Democratic Left Alliance and all members and members. This is the next stage.
3525	103	Do you feel the left hunger?
3525	105	It is seen on the streets. You can see how they talk to us when we share the bills. As we gathered signatures - we gathered over 400 thousand signatures gathered in two and a half weeks, without any problem. This is seen after how people react to us, what we say. You can see it on Twitter, Facebook. People see that the parliament without the left is not normal. They need stability and normality. And we will not go to any radicalism. We will not talk about divisions, other varieties, worthy murders. We do not use this language. I think there is a need for the left.
3526	1	What is the Jewish Ideology?
3526	3	North Korea is perceived in our country as an emerging communist state, both in terms of economic and ideological aspects. This misconception arises from the fact that from the human nature comes the desire to simplify our own worldview on the principle of comparison with what is close to us, what we have experienced, or what has been taught. The problem is that we see, for example. Asia is the “trick of other Europeans”. We measure their values, customity, a sense of aesthetics or behavior by our own measurement. This is most likely due to the fact that our education system is decisively euro-centric and that point of view has been presented to us since younger years. However, there are worlds outside of us and they are deeply different from it. They are neither worse nor better, but they are governed by their own unique rules.
3526	5	Korean racism
3526	7	So, in the case of modern North Korea, we are dealing with the ruling ideology called the Jung, in the literal sense “self-sufficiency”. First of all, it should be emphasized that it is a type of ethno-centric, totalitarian, shovinist ideology that uses the natural tendency of the Koreans in general to avoid “mixing” with other ethnic groups. People who live in Korea, for example. The territory of the Russian Federation, extremely rarely enter into mixed marriage or non-marriage relations, and metis, i.e. The descendants of the white and yellow races are seen as at least suspicious persons. In the case of North Korea, the “racial purity” is respected, because it even concerns the prohibition of entering in love interactions with South Koreans (absorbing the possibility of entering in such relations at all because of the deep degree of closure of that country to external contacts). This even led to anthropological and linguistic differences between South Koreans and North Koreans.
3526	9	Therefore, it should be started with the fact that for a Korean from the north his nation or even the race (in the meaning of the Korean race from their point of view) is the cleanest also in terms of any qualities, national characteristics, habits, etc. The Korean race, therefore, must take care not to “push” its magnificent genes with any external factors, because it threatens to lose national identity, perfection, and will also take them the opportunity to be a kind of “elected nation”.
3526	11	I am not unwilling to bring this definition here, because it is characteristic of all sovinism and ethno-centrisms, that is, the assumption that the members of a given national group are predestined to something higher than the others. It is found in North Korea (but also in North Korea). in Japan) the absolute endemicity of the Korean population, and for this purpose the historical policy of the state chooses historical facts from the key that favors such a position (in the “free” Japan is exactly the same, there is practically no freedom of scientific research in the discipline of history, and any scientific positions disputing with sometimes obvious historical falsifications are strictly punished).
3526	13	Women's Guides
3526	15	The Korean nation is ruled by the Kim family, whom in Western media in an ironic, ridiculous and deprived of deeper understanding is attributed to the divine characteristics. From the point of view, however, the politics of the North Korean elite of power, the Kim’s themselves are not presented to their people as gods who do not even have physiological needs or have supernatural abilities. This kind of representation of the Korean leader (currently Kim Jong Un) is harmful to those interested in the topic itself, as it disrupts the understanding of the ideology of the jungle. So the Korean leader has both male and female characteristics, but with the advantage of those female, which has its reflection in the visual layer (weight, round faces). It is not unimportant that in North Korea the mother's figure has a high status, which reflects even the dictionary definitions available in that country. The definition of a woman is extremely widespread, and the concept of a man is almost limited to the idea that he is simply the son of a mother. Therefore, it is the prism of this knowledge that should be seen as laughing at the so-called The images of obese Kim. Additionally, the overweight, the softness of the faces features and pulpity are there considered attractive visually, just as in Europe the scratch shell. On the biology of human attractiveness, many interesting scientific books have been written, to which I refer here, where differences in perception of beauty in different parts of the world are justified. However, it is necessary to go back to further consideration of the characteristics of North Korean state ideology, since it is extremely intriguing with a closer understanding of it.
3526	17	The leader is usually presented as a gentle, smiling, misleading for his relatives, German, and even disgusting figure. If we compare this image from the image of even Soviet, the leaders will see the contrast. The Soviet leader was to be male, serious, harsh, strong, omnipotent and standing on the guard of the order, according to which the Soviet nation, every member of it was to act as a mode in the perfectly working machine. When we analyze the North Korean art, the art of the illustration of the leader itself, we will see that we are most often faced with the image of a mother, which admiredly looks at the impatience of their own children, allowing them to a high degree of impatience, infantilism, and even lenist at work. The Korean nation is a child nation. Children unreformed for their own safety, protected by senses from the destruction of the external world, its only apparent attractiveness (often consumer), which receives man’s soul, prevents spiritual growth and ultimately leads to loss. This is why in Korean television, although extremely carefully censored, the so-called show is not avoided. South Korean welfare. The people of North Korea, to a certain extent, are aware of their worse social position compared to their own neighbors, yet they are informed that their path, though unpleasant, is the right one.
3526	19	Children's Order
3526	21	"The nation-child is to be under permanent care, it decides (as our parents did) what hairstyles its members can wear, what to wear, where to stay, what to do and what to watch and what not. For the “bad”, that is. frequently encountered at the border with China or the Russian Federation illegal acquisition by North Koreans of any kind of material (from press to audiovisual), sanctions are provided by the “mother”. The escape from the country is especially severely punished, because the escaper ""sucks"" somehow the strange influences of the harmful, external world. Likewise, in Japan, a foreign stay for more than a half year (except for diplomatic missions) is treated as one of the types of national betrayal. Despite the deep Americanization of this country, there are still the principles characteristic of the region and the perception by the Far East Asians of what is the good of the nation and loyalty to its peoples. It can be surprising for the Reader at the same time the fact that, according to statistics, most of the refugees from the KRLD return on their own hand to their homeland despite the awareness that they are waiting for them on the site, for example. in the Criminal Colony."
3526	23	Responsibility of collection
3526	25	In Asia the so-called Generation vengeance belongs even to the traditional characteristics of the region, North Korea is nothing different from the rule in this regard. For the inappropriate behavior of one member of the nation, the whole of his family suffers. The penalties are, therefore, collective, subject to gender key, transpolar. It should be emphasized in this place that generational punishments and knowledge etc. The ability to mention the ancestors to the seventh generation back (often from the father's line) is something normal, for example. In the Turkish-Mongol nations of Central Asia, in other cases it is recognized as a person who has neglected this part of his gender identity (in the Asian there is the so-called multiple or multi-level identity) for the traitors, both of their own families, as well as simply persons convicted of social ostracism (this problem is strictly limited in large, “neuropeized” urban centers). So, as we do not assess the punishment of the whole family for the fault of one citizen, this is a typical phenomenon for the region in question and is not derived from the specificity of North Korea alone.
3526	27	Hospitality and threat
3526	29	The Koreans are also divided according to the hierarchical structure that in simplicity divides the nation into three layers: the majority of the nation, which is of course the foundation of the pyramid, the official layer and the elite of power, i.e. The family of Kim. It should be emphasized that tourists are welcomed in North Korea as if they belong to the least official layer and are treated with respect and guest (obviously, provided that the rules arise from the specificity of the country). The tourists receive most often two caregivers (always a woman and a man), who have the ability to communicate in the native language of the guest. North Korea itself is safe to travel to the country in contrast to many tourist-covered corners of the world. The guests, however, are isolated from the ordinary Koreans, the limited contact is not only due to the reign of the informational order ruling in North Korea but also simply by the saturation of conscious or subconscious residents with what are mentally “required” by tourists.
3526	31	Religious but rational
3526	33	The Jewish ideology – as I mentioned at the beginning of the text – is characterized by ethnocentryism. It is definitely closer to the nurses of fascist, Soviet, German Nazism, Ukrainian Banderism than, in essence, the internationalist Soviet socialism, which even cares for the corenization of the nations in its territory, which does not see anything problematic in the racist and ethnic mixture between the members of the (therefore targeted) forming Soviet nation. Korean Sowinism is characterized by the primordial perception of national identity, i.e. The Korean must be born from the mother and father of the Koreans, recognize the principle of conservation of racial purity as one of the superiorities, absolutely love the “mother of the nation” (the British also called their own queen “Queen Mother”) and listen to her recommendations. The “Cult” of the Kim is, however, not a kind of deification, i.e. The aspect of the rationality of the Korean people is respected and it is not trying to present to him something that he could not have to deal with in a “namational” sense. The education of children in the world of eternal fantasy at a certain point begins to irritate their intolerance and ceases to be somewhat disciplinating.
3526	35	Interpretation difficulties
3526	37	The understanding of the North Korean ideology is, however, difficult to deepen for people who do not know the Korean language, as the contents on the websites of the KRLD government are in the content layer completely different in the English and Korean language. As long as we can read in English that North Korea desires peace in the world, lives in harmony with all nations, is a normal member of the international community or desires to comply with all the principles and rights established in the framework of international organizations, so in Korean language is described the satisfaction of deceiving the rest of the world about the actual situation of North Korea, its foreign policy, its security, or how the elites of the power perceive that international community they have, not less, not more than in absolute contempt. Knowing this fact, you should ask yourself how true they are, for example. reports of the rule of hunger in North Korea expressed by the North Korean diplomatic body itself, surprisingly perfectly correlated with crises bound by the war between both Korea and the United States (which does not mean that there is no hunger problem in this country at all; I mean here only official communications where it is admitted that North Korea is threatened by a hunger crash).
3526	39	In conclusion, the Koreans of the DPRK are a nation immersed in the sovinist, racist ideology, they live in an atmosphere of permanent mobilization for the defense of their own homeland not so much as pure and naturalized to them as good, protected, and more educated by a leader with maternal, female qualities. This nation is a scientist that it does not have to fight on force with its own desires or biological conditions (as the Soviet man had to do by giving himself full work). You have the right to be uninformed, protected from harmful content (we are also already protected from them!) Like children. Everything to be the “most pure race” in the world.
3527	1	God of Fertility
3527	3	Jarosław Kaczynski becomes a specialist of everything. 
3527	5	During his stand-ups he has already talked about the types of coal (it has been shown that there is coal sorted and not sorted). You can also use brown coal in the oven and this will not harm anyone. He talked about the financial and euro prices in Germany. He just forgot to add that for the rarities of the party he leads, Poland owes more than for the governments of Secretary Gierka and it will be paid by our grandchildren. 
3527	7	Jarozbaw is pleased to talk about family and children although he has only a cat and Sasina on his side. It says that in the West it feels foreign culturally. His favorite themes are the fear of the Germans and the LGBT. He even dreamed of stories about the Shark shops, although he never was in them, because for half his life his mother did shopping, and for the second half Partia.
3527	9	The President of Poland has a lot to say about the tastes and the education of the youth, although he himself only raised the taste of the butterfly of Zmurszałka Terleckiego. 
3527	11	He has been a specialist in addiction and procréation. A man needs 20 years to become an alcoholic, and a woman only 2 years to become an alcoholic. I know a guy who cried non-stop for 12 years and died. According to the scale of Kaczynski, he missed eight years to become an alcoholic. It is a comfort because he died completely healthy. 
3527	13	Kaczynski has a healthy relationship with women because he says those who drink don’t want to have children. This is why there are no children in Poland.  So far it was judged differently. That those who abuse alcohol more often get pregnant due to negligence and lack of caution in choosing partners. Some even think that only those who were made by their parents after drunk can vote for PiS.  And as we know, this is not a small number, because about 25 percent of the population.
3527	15	And here the Genius of Novgorod goes out with the theory that what they put in the neck is not born. 
3527	17	Let’s remember that Jarosław is a specialist of the rodeo, which is passionate looking at night, so who knows if in the matters of the position on the rider there is no right here, because the drunk is harder to stay on the horse.
3527	19	I’m looking forward to the fourth chapter of the Czech Republic that will begin to publish its theories on women’s fashion and seasonal high couture shows in Paris or Milan.
3527	21	This is not as impossible as it seems at first glance.  In the role of a culinary researcher, he has already debuted telling about his social and gastronomic discovery, namely the Cooker of Prilubskaya. 
3527	23	Interesting can be the reflections of Kaczynski about medieval German poetry, Netflix series, hip-hop from the East Coast, or computer games like The Sims. 
3527	25	I am convinced that this specialist of pregnancy and female fertility will give birth to itself and Poland a lot of sick ideas.
3528	1	Jesus is angry with his fanbase in Poland
3528	3	"According to a press spokesman, the atmosphere ""on height"" is very tensioned. The reason is the calling of the Poles to the teachings of God with their simultaneous indifference to the detained refugees, or even an open disappointment to them."
3528	5	What do they do not understand in the message to love each other?! He had to scream the Creator, which would interpret the transitional flashes and grims over the Upper Knight. 
3528	7	Situations do not help twitty and post people who have no problem with hate speech and offending others on a daily basis, and at the same time publicly praise their faith.
3528	9	I haven’t seen a boss so embarrassed since the great flood. He has literally gone out of himself, becoming the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit at the same time – a person from God’s close surroundings betrayes us, adding – I don’t understand these Poles, if they held the fruits on this border, they’t have to wait for salvation even a day. Luck wanted them to be twins, and these Poles probably just hate them.
3528	11	It’s an assassin, but God really has a weak fanbase in Poland.
3529	1	A breakthrough in defence policy. In the border with Russia there will be a potato barrier.
3529	3	Poland took a lesson after its recent actions for the defense of the country. This time, instead of creating a firewall, the government decided to use a more solid material that will scare even the most courageous dreams of a Polish birth. At the Polish-Russian border there will be a potato wall.
3529	5	This is not an appetite snack, but a dangerous weapon, the head of the Ministry of National Defense warns. – What a potato is green, so its consumption can end up with a serious food poisoning.
3529	7	The attempt to break through the Polish scrap is the Russian roulette, says PiS politician. “Maybe the first two pires will be delicious, but you’ll never know if the third one will be poisoning. 
3529	9	According to the implementation act of the Ministry of National Defense, the mobilization of communities to jointly isolate the state from the forces of the enemy bulva will begin next week. 
3529	11	A strong prison will protect the Republic from the invaders, who will glorify the empire protected by potato heroes. 
3529	13	“This is not only the defense of the state, but also the honor of the centuries-old tradition,” said the director of the Institute of History at the Catholic University of Lubel. In 2023 we will celebrate the 340th anniversary of the official unification of the nation with the potato. It was at that time that John III Sobieski, returning from the Vienna journey, brought a potato bulve to the country. 
3529	15	In the past, they were called “tough apples” because people were aware of their potential toxicity. We want to prove that despite the refining of the potato, we still remember that it was actually created as a weapon of mass destruction.
3529	17	Based on estimates of agricultural and garden land plants, this year the surface of potato cultivation will be approximately 200,000. and ha. 
3529	19	“If the year 2023 will be more pleasant, we will not exclude the surroundings of the entire Poland,” the Minister of National Defense said. Strategic Defence Review.
3529	21	And for the soldiers staying at the potato seat, unlimited frites are provided. 
3529	23	“It’s a small cake for a man, but a huge potato for the homeland,” said MON’s boss. 
353	1	Bidena Playing Abortion
353	3	A favorable liberal-left environment, traditionally unwanted right-wing both in the United States and in Europe, the influential portal “Politico” wrote to pain honestly in the context of the November elections in the United States: “in the struggle for the majority in the House of Representatives democracies put on abortion.”
353	5	Indeed, the issue of protecting the lives of unborn children – or even the contrary – has never so much divided the Republicans and the Joe Biden Party. Probably this is the result of the division not only of the political class, but of the whole of America after a judgment by the U.S. Supreme Court four months ago, which disrupted the long-run abortionist judgment from the court case Roe v. Wade. This judgment obviously “falandising” that is, drawing the law brought the legal possibility of interruption of pregnancy from the U.S. fundamental law. The Supreme Court, thanks to President Donald Trump with a minimum, but the majority of judges from the Republican environments did not impose anything on the Americans and Americans, but decided that now the matters of the protection of the lives of unborn children will be resolved by the individual states, and it will not be decided at the federal level.
353	7	How hot this topic is, reports from journalists show that up to 1/3 of the funds spent on electoral advertising in the campaigns to the House of Representatives, the Senate and the positions of governors concerns just the abortion. Just on this type of advertising, the Democratic Party candidates to the U.S. Congress and to state functions only spent up to $18 million by the end of September of this year. The campaign will last until the end of October and part of November. Compared to the previous elections, Democrats have already now spent more on the election campaign “for abortion” than in the entire elections four years ago.
353	9	On November 8, the US citizens will elect all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the US Senate. In addition, the game is about the seat of a governor in thirty pair of U.S. states. The election race Republicans vs. Democracy is passionate, but even more passionate former parliamentary elections. Especially in the party symbolized by the elephants, the Republicans, it was fascinating. He was very actively involved in it by Donald Trump, who was able to overthrow the vast majority of his candidates. He also showed a particular pragmatism, because to the surprise of experts, and even to the dissatisfaction of the “trumpists”, he was able to support his former critics, as long as they had real chances of winning. The pragmatic ex-president wanted them to win with his support, not against him. In the fight against Trump's candidates, the Republican leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell and associated organizations were indirectly engaged in making money so that Trump's candidates did not win the parliamentary elections. This was a spectacular event in the state of New Hampshire.
353	11	The fact is that by winning the Republican elections in November 2022, Trump may have reduced the chances of a Republican candidate – that is himself – in the elections in November, only 2024. It is not only a great advantage for the Republicans, but also a burden for many, especially more moderate voters. But it expects that in the next two years democracies will compromise themselves until the end, and that despite the numerous negative voters it has, the way to the White House will be open again.
3530	1	The Fire of the Marseille
3530	3	Being dead is safe. You can lie and gnit, not absorb new ideas, civilizational and cultural changes. Living without the need to change. And, most importantly, without giving up. It’s a coral that young people don’t want to make.
3530	5	I love to fantate. I don’t have to specially put in my neck (this is the president’s failure) or run, so that my imagination may be dominated by “warfare” visions. And I have to admit that I love those moments, because I feel that it is in them – or rather through them – that I now experience what is just to come, what is before the world, before me.
3530	7	When I close my eyes at night, I struggle with the dreaming sleep, so that I can experience at least for a moment the images that dominate my brain, before I fall into the foolish unconsciousness. I am pleased with the moment when on the border of the dream I let the imagination burn. Especially when he then pays me with dreams that even the greatest opiums will not be overwhelmed.
3530	9	Like the one I dreamed in the night after I returned from the Third Congress of Good Hope, on which I discussed with Robert Lisiewicz, Nina Gabris, Frank Sterchewski and Joanna Nezgodzka – care. When we looked at TROSCE as a tool for social change.
3530	11	For a long time I have believed that this concern should replace in this country all the wicked passions that we have suffered as a society for centuries, building a great Polish patriotic narration.
3530	13	Fight a wife, rape a wife, take her reproductive rights, and above all love the Fatherland. Fantasy, bodies and embryos. And let it be a powerful, romantic, love from which you can miss the senses and suffer. Love that can be saved and killed.
3530	15	Only that love that requires sacrifices is the love consecrated in Polish culture – in each of its manifestations: in literature, visual arts, film, music, sculpture, theatre. Another love, understood as kindness and care, no one in this country teaches anyone. For how do we teach when we teach love for the bodies, not for the living? The bodies are understood not only in the context of the dead. I also think of bodies – narratives, bodies – ideas, bodies – values.
3530	17	The world can truly be understood by accepting that there are people living in it who find the meaning of their existence in correlation with what is alive, and with what is angry—which is broken down, because it has long been dead. You can, by simplifying, bring this diversification to the distinction of Conservative (body) and Progressive (live), although many of you will blame me of the simplification. I accept the accusation, you probably are right.
3530	19	However, the post-pandemic world has so much changed and has so much accelerated that it now needs simplifications, not old, extended, soap-looking arguments that maintain old narratives in life. For some reason, the activists are stressed, and the politicians are still stumbling the cottage, from which there is absolutely nothing for the world.
3530	21	The majority of politicians don’t want change. He wants to sit next to the corpse, to breathe the sweet and sharp wrath of the burst, to observe the larves wandering after the crashes of the TK, to inspire the tightened sight of reproductive rights and social policy, to harvest the tomb under the education system that in this country has always been harvested, because it is based on intolerance and violence – for only in this national tomb it feels dead.
3530	23	That’s what they are talking about. Being dead is safe. You can lie and go, not absorb new ideas, civilizational and cultural changes, the fall of one paradigm, and the birth of new ones, you can simply be who you are, and so already da capo al fine. Without the need to change. And, most importantly, without giving up. It’s a coral that young people don’t want to make.
3530	25	I am going to meritum. For this is about them, about the young, and not about the body of the Pilsudski march (the same body) is this text. For this war of the bodies with the young is not, as the bodies think, about the corrotum, but about it, but about the confusion of the corrotum, about the nutrients, about the content.
3530	27	The young people don’t want to throw the shadows – the old ideas, the depths of fossil fuels over renewable energy sources, the depths of lack of access to abortion or abortion up to the 12th week over borderless abortion, the exclusion of LGBTQ people to ensure a sense of safety to residents and residents of the Republic of Congo. and Bleh.
3530	29	The young people are angry about it, and they do not laugh, because the bodies of the ideas, like the animal’s thickness, are usually in their throat. They don’t see the meaning of killing living beings to just feel their taste. They don’t see the meaning of receiving milk from bodies as you can drink vegetable. I believe that if vegan products were funded by the state, young people would choose them even more often. Unfortunately, they are still more expensive, because we need to sponsor large farms, farms and farms – we need to push the farmers, so they can also sit at the corridors and vote for who they need, in the next elections. Thus, the young people who not only do not want to sit at the courtyard, but also to crush the “troop” and throw the troop, most often remain unemployed or on waste contracts, practically without means of life, without the possibility of realizing themselves in their chosen specialty or profession.
3530	31	And that’s why I’m now directing my “TROSK” to them, which I, as OzN’s caregiver, direct every day to my teenage autistic daughters.
3530	33	I’m not here behind young programmers or programmers, because I know they’re doing well, because they know the “language” that the world has broken up. The language in which this world is now most often translated and told. I write with concern about that part of the young people who still speak the language of human beings, not of robots, because I warmly believe that this language must survive.
3530	35	It is precisely in it that it contains care, without which the young people will not survive – but, most importantly, we will not survive ourselves, because without the young people, without their involvement in climate, equality policy, social activism, and therefore without their sensitivity, we will be forced to stay at the coral with the Zombies, and to grind hard – to live old divisions, old narratives, old modus vivendi. And only clothes in recycled on the lashes of the progressors. And that we don’t want. We don’t want to pretend that we belong to a newly forming world, but to create it and belong to it, the cities cry at the body and roll the clothes at the body.
3530	37	Let’s not be naive. They recognize us. We will only be the wreathers of the Polish wreath – the patriarchate, the pathological complex of inferiority covered by pseudopatriotism and Mesianism, the lise-Chytrus of nations, the violent wreath and the wreath with which no one will want to sit at the table.
3530	39	There is one way to do this: let’s bring the young people into the institutions of culture – let’s not employ the film plays, in the philharmonies, theatres, only the old exhortators, who are often “on stages” elsewhere. I wish them the best possible, knowing the loans. But that does not explain anything.
3530	41	The misrepresentation of the youth makes us still wear the same mask, the same used hole, and we don’t change the system from the inside. If there was a law on the need for employment in the youth culture, let’s say that they were at least 30 percent of the employees, they would eventually get to work those who live from work at the bar, cleaning or harassment, even though they dreamed of something else. And they did a titanic work in this direction! And nothing. Because with the so-called corytes there are only those who have managed to take the position before, some time before the pandemic.
3530	43	Then, when you have lived under the old narration – let yourself be humiliated, let yourself be swallowed, or maybe you will be given. The work managed by humiliation, by sex, by chilling, by craving, by careless work without time for a personal life or for a dream, irresponsible – a narrative under which it was necessary to pass to a million ways to reach permissions to your table. Everything is based on trauma – first studying, then trying to find a job in the profession.
3530	45	Where do we care about those who “do not get stuck”? Where to Balance Opportunities? Where is the new story? This is the case in all cultures – old toposes, old tights, old stories of poor ones betrayed by Poland or soluble breaks on solved women alcoholic. The desire to be humiliated. Dreams of rape. Social, political and physical. The continuous call of humiliation and pain. Make dysfunction and suffering attractive goods. How many of these stories we have to read, see, experience. How much do you get over the wounded, disappointed and therefore most often toxic malehood?
3530	47	How many of these matches with Lewandowski can still be seen and those telephone ads or for a quarter of gold-buy clocks, rather than asking him to promote not vacuum and capitalist shit, but climate action? To encourage the world’s most oppressive footballers to refuse to fly and take part in the matches only where the train or car with a hybrid engine goes?
3530	49	This is today being, crazy, trends, and not wearing a silver clock in the breathing world due to climate poisoning. And that Lewandowski and Lewandowski could explain this not only to their children, but to all the young people, that it is not worth following those who copy, and those who struggle for life. life of the planet. Lewandowski, if you read me, please think about this TROSCE. You can be a million times more than me.
3530	51	Or let’s imagine a parliament now, where young activists and activists come in the place of the old stories. As on the international stage, we are represented as the Minister of Climate and Environment, Victoria Jytroszkiewicz or Dominika Lasota, and not Anna Moscow.
3530	53	And now my dream, a week ago, because I haven’t told you it yet...
3530	55	I had a marshal with a thick fat. A cushion from which the fat breja capped on the uniform, “sweating” it at the same time unlikely. On the threshold settled cracks and cracks, which suddenly began to eat the surrounding Marshalka rebound. Pilsudski, the city to overcome the bird with its thickness, the habit of rotating the hipsteric narrow with the hand, scattered its widespread arms, reminding the fear of the reversal. But it is nothing else...
3530	57	For I saw suddenly, in a dream, the Kasztanka standing next to him – a clay, which he loved with flameful love and I don’t know if so to the end purely platonic... And the Kasztanka first looked in his eyes, after which the dumb stood like in the Shale of Podkovinsky, after which she turned to him with a clay and showed her rejection. Looking like Sauron’s eye... Follow the words, as Lacan swallowed, I said to myself immediately after awakening – The story of the eye, Georges Bataille, batalia, Kasztanka doesn’t give birth to children, because she drinks too much, Marshalek drinks and therefore the name Pill-Sudski, just why puts it into the swallow the dildos of carbon?
3531	1	Europe 2035: Zobro looks in the palantir and sees the disappearance
3531	3	The minister of the party without support saw things that you, people, would not believe. Without him, we would not know what awaits us. Only thanks to the iron nerves Ziobro did not deceive and was able to return to us and tell us our future if we remain in the European Union. Here is his testimony.
3531	5	Europe in 2035. Prohibition of eating meat. Prohibition of carrying a car with a fuel engine. Prohibition of carbon smoking. The term “mother” and “father”, “man” and “woman” are prohibited. That is the goal of the eurocrates.
3531	7	But this does not end. I have seen things that you, people, would not believe.
3531	9	I saw churches full of narcotic dancing people. The moon throwing the sutan to take part in the homospaces in latex clothes. Temples converted into discounts, sofa bars and bookstores. Bishops and the Pope's sons. The Vatican as a museum. The monasteries of African migrants.
3531	11	I saw white people disappearing like snow in March. Instead of schabowy and snickle – the sea of falafli, shisabar, Georgian bakers. Children with the names Aziz, Danylo, Simba instead of Antek, Zbyszek, Wojtek. Two-language schools, writing in foreign languages in the metro. Atheism rather than catechism. Priests are prohibited from entering educational institutions.
3531	13	I saw Polish girls in the hands with other girls. Being kissed in clubs, parks, in private places. Polish boys in makeup and soft clothes. Dancing until the morning with other boys. They fall with them in beds. Unknown the weight of the father's hand. The babies have four grandparents, the babies have four grandparents.
3531	15	And the end of the intimate sacrum of sexual relationships. Stryvialization makes her sex. Making the mythical gift of the Creator – pregnancy – a ordinary medical situation. Unfortunate punishment for parents for normal pedagogical failures.
3531	17	Instead of your own beer and carrot – marijuana and hallucinogenic fungi in every store. Prohibition of the production of clay and clay. We have vegan foods for children.
3531	19	I saw the monuments of our Pope disappearing from the streets, coming to the museum, covered with colorful colors. New patterns of squares and squares: Rosa Luxemburg, Natalia LL, Jackowskaya Kora. Closed for three spots of the IPN, Father Rydzyk in the cabinets. Patriots from the UN at the courts, and then forced to social work in Oswiecimi, Treblince and Majdanka. 100 people on the March of Independence.
3531	21	Drivers with whom the bicyclists go. They were forced to leave by buses and tramways. Lost parking for green people. Broken and crying. Marriages given by a rabbin or a colleague, divorces that are a simple formality. The young wives quietly silent at the Christmas table. The grandmother was forced to ask, “Casiu, like your girlfriend, why did she not come to us today?”
3531	23	I saw the president apologizing for Wussoz, Zalesny, Jedwabne. Poland on its knees, broken with Germany and Ukraine. Jews returning to Poland. An Eagle Without a Crown, Communists in Parliament. The post, on which you can no longer buy the book of Roskovsky and the visitor with the pope. The cooking sisters of the law, biographies of the “excellent”.
3531	25	I, Zbigniew Zebro, have seen things that you, people, would not believe. All the states in crazy sweeping to the arms of Soros. I watched the stroboscopes bright in the darkness near the hill of the Light Mountain. All our dreams disappear in time like tears in the rain. This is the Brussels Union, a deadly, great, unregular European Union. Time to die.
3531	27	This text is satirical. Zbigniew Zobrze lacks not only support, but also imagination. It is nothing but an unwilling repeat and parafragment of the anti-Yunian Russian propaganda.
3531	29	And then, do you say, is this vision really so tragic?
3532	1	The coronavirus. Australia: Hundreds of people infected on board a tour ship
3532	3	At the coast of Australia, a majestic princess cruise vessel, on which a coronavirus fire was confirmed, the BBC. Of the 4,600 people on board, 800 were infected. Currently, the number of COVID-19 infections in Australia is increasing.
3532	5	The Majestic Princess cruise ship, which fled from New Zealand, arrived on Saturday at the Circular Quay port in Sydney, Australia. According to the report, 4600 passengers and crew members were on board. 800 of them were infected with COVID-19, which means that every fifth person was infected.
3532	7	According to Marguerite Fitzgerald, representative of Carnival Australia tour operator, most cases began to be detected in the middle of a 12-day trip. As she added, all people had mild symptoms or did not show them at all.
3532	9	Fitzgerald said the crew will help all passengers get to “private transport or accommodation where they will be able to stay until the end of the isolation.”
3532	11	The coronavirus. Increases the number of infected in Australia
3532	13	The situation on the trip vessel that travelled in Australia reminds the situation from the beginning of 2020. At the time, 900 people on the Ruby Princess ship received a positive coronavirus test result, and 28 people died. Marguerite Fitzgerald was asked for a comparison between these events (Ruby Princess belongs to the same operator).
3532	15	“Since that time, as a community, we’ve learned a lot more about COVID-19,” she replied.
3532	17	According to the BBC, the explosion occurred when the number of coronavirus infections was increased in Australia. In the last seven days, 19,800 infections have been confirmed in the state of New South Wales.
3533	1	The coronavirus. Variant Cerber BQ.1.1 rapidly spread in Germany
3533	3	Cerber is a descendant of the Omikron BA.5 subvariant. It is now widely spread in the United States. However, it is clearly growing in force also on the Old Continent. The European Ds Center. Prevention and Disease Control suggests that BQ.1.1 will be from mid-November responsible for more than 50 percent of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
3533	5	"Due to its high infection, the new coronavirus variant received the pseudonym ""Cerber"", as in Greek mythology it was called the giant three-head dog guards the entrance to the world of the dead, the hell dog. The scientifically correct name of the new subvariant is BQ.1."
3533	7	As for Europe, it currently has the highest percentage of infections in France. It accounts for almost 20 percent of the coronavirus infection. This is now less than 2 percent in Germany. However, virologists predict a very rapid growth.
3533	9	Moritz Gerstung, a specialist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, predicts that BQ.1.1 may start dominating in Germany around November 10.
3533	11	Many experts assume that BQ.1.1 will be responsible for the next major coronavirus wave in Europe and North America, which may occur before the end of November. All this is because its transmission is ten times greater than the current dominant subvariant Omikron BA.5. This means that infections occur faster.
3533	13	Less dangerous mutations
3533	15	The mutated virus can also be more effective than the previous variants to avoid our immune system. According to Gerstung, the subvariant is infectious also for vaccinated and healers. A person infected infects between 60 and 80 percent more people than with Omikron. 
3533	17	In turn, the positive feature of Cerber is that it is a descendant of an omicron variant rather than a subtype of Delta, which is considered a potentially more dangerous mutation and leads to a greater number of hospitalizations. According to experts, the situation is similar in the case of vaccines. These created against Omikron also act on his subvariants. 
3533	19	In addition, as the President of the German Immunological Society confirms, the current vaccines continue to protect against severe fluctuations and deaths. It also explains that although BQ.1.1 mutations indicated a potentially greater infection, they did not indicate that all defence mechanisms were omitted.
3533	21	Virologists do not expect the return of the severe pathways that occurred at the beginning of the pandemic, when in the population there was no immunity at all.
3534	1	SG: Illegal migrants have tried to cross the border. Citizens of Iraq and Somalia
3534	3	88 foreigners tried to pass from Belarus to Poland on Sunday morning, the Border Guard said. Since the beginning of the month, SG has recorded a total of 1 000 pounds. An attempt to illegally cross the border from Belarus to Poland.

The electronic barrier, which is to be 202 km, will also cover sections where there is no steel ceiling, for example. The border rivers.
3534	19	MSWiA has recently announced that the first, 35-kilometre, electronic lock section will be delivered to use next week.
3534	21	From 1 July, the prohibition of approaching the Polish-Belarusian border at a distance of less than 200 meters is in force in Podlask, issued by the military, with a request to be introduced by the Commander of the Podlask Division SG.

3537	13	One of the topics of this year’s conference is the possibility of compensation for global warming-related damage to the most exposed and poor countries.
3538	1	Two climate activists flooded on Saturday with a clone syrup the picture of Canadian painter Emily Carr, located in the permanent collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, the gallery said in a statement. There was no permanent damage to the work.
3538	3	"The attack on Emily Carr was carried out by the ""Stop Fracking Around"" group, which aims to stop the construction of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline pipeline, leading to Kitimat in British Columbia. According to a statement quoted by the Canadian media, the group’s actions, like other activists who have recently chosen themselves for the purpose of the work of art, are taken to pay attention to the climate change caused by humans. On its website, the group explains that it is demanding to stop in Canada the gas extraction by the hydraulic fracking method."
3538	5	Emily Carr is one of the most important characters of Canadian painting. Police in Vancouver are investigating the attack on the 1934 painted picture.
3538	7	The Vancouver Art Gallery, which has been established since 1931, is a non-profit organization and is one of the most important art galleries in North America.
3538	9	A series of events involving climate activists
3538	11	In recent months, climate activists have organized a number of events in museums and cultural institutions.
3538	13	Only in October, the activists of the German group Letzte Generation (The Last Generation) dropped the potato-pure painting of Claude Monet’s “Stan Stogs” at the Barberini Museum in Poczdama, Germany, and then clinged to the wall.
3538	15	"Two young activists swallowed the tomato soup ""Sunshine"" of Vincent van Gogh in the London Museum, and two activists from the same collective appeared in the famous Madame Tussaud Waste Figures Museum in London. Their ""offering"" was the figure of King Charles III."
3538	17	"On Wednesday, two women from the Stop Fossil Fuel Subsidies group sprayed a series of images of Andy Warhol's ""Campbell Soup Pudding"" at the National Gallery of Australia, and later tried to stick to them."
3538	19	No work that was the target of the activists was damaged.
3539	1	Covid restrictions are still in force. We check where to remember vaccination and tests
3539	3	The United States, Austria, China and Japan are only a part of the countries where restrictions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic are still in force when it crosses the border. We have analyzed the latest changes in European countries.
3539	5	"Even a year ago, tests in some countries were required both before arrival and immediately after leaving the aircraft. Without entrance restrictions. Quarantine is not required"" - today such opinions can be encountered more and more by browsing the government page with the latest restrictions on entrance to individual countries. At the same time, it is worth remembering that when traveling to Africa, practically in every country, it is necessary to have a negative test."
3539	7	Austria without restrictions, except Vienna
3539	9	In Europe, the majority of countries have ended the exacerbations that have been introduced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. One example is Austria, where all aggravations have been eliminated. At the entrance, the 3G principle is no longer applicable and the obligation to wipe your mouth and nose with a mask. The exception is Vienna. 
3539	11	In the capital of Austria, passengers in public transportation, line trains, shopping facilities and other public places are still required to throw the nose and mouth with FFP2 mask.
3539	13	Oman with duty to wear masks
3539	15	Restrictions related to COVID-19 are also applicable in Oman. In this Asian state, people living in some public places are required to wear masks.
3539	17	The United States is only for vaccines.
3539	19	What about traveling to the United States? Unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated persons will not be allowed to enter the United States. Exceptions include children under 18 years of age, aircraft crew members; visa holders A1, A2, C2, C3, G1-4, NATO1-4, NATO6, foreigners traveling at the UN invitation, persons whose age is impossible to vaccinate, persons with medical contraindications to vaccinate, participants in research/tests on vaccines against COVID-19, persons who have obtained the CDC Director’s approval, armed forces and their spouses and children and travelers from countries where vaccine is limited and having a visa other than B1/2.
3539	21	China unable access to vaccines
3539	23	Vaccinated travelers traveling to China will not benefit from any facilities when crossing the border. Passengers must obtain two negative COVID-19 tests performed no more than 48 hours before boarding, performed by molecular method (RT-PCR) in two different laboratories. The interval between the two tests must be at least 24 hours. Additionally, the second test must be done less than 24 hours before the aircraft arrives in China. 
3539	25	In Japan, the first two doses are recognized by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson vaccines (one doses are treated as two). In the case of the third dose (or the second in the case of J&J), Similar vaccines are only accepted by Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
3539	27	Entrance to Japan for vaccinated persons
3539	29	A necessary condition for traveling to Japan is full vaccination against COVID-19. The Japanese authorities require three-fold vaccination. Polish vaccination certificates are accepted. Covid certificate must be issued in Japanese or English.
3539	31	What about non-vaccinated people who intend to travel to Japan? In such a situation, it is necessary to perform the test and to obtain a certificate of the negative result of the test for the presence of the SARS CoV-2 virus made within 72 hours before departure.
3539	33	Egypt, Slovenia and Thailand with mandatory form
3539	35	In Egypt, however, the quarantine obligation has been abolished and no tests are required before arrival and after landing, the travellers are still obliged to fill in the location form. “On the vessels of aircraft flying to Egypt are distributed localization forms, which must be submitted to the services after leaving the aircraft,” said gov.pl.
3539	37	The situation is similar to the situation of travellers across the border of Slovenia. On the air and sea passes, a digital passenger location form must be filled. Also, the authorities of Thailand are expecting the arrivals to fill out the location document in a paper version, after the arrival. In turn, those planning a trip to the Republic of Greenland should fill the print for 5 days before the trip.
3539	39	On the other hand, in Colombia, a health form should be filled after crossing the border. 
354	1	“This is a decisive moment in the history of the law on abortion in the world,” Amnesty warns.
354	3	Amnesty International calls on state governments around the world to respect and protect abortion rights. On the International Day for Safe Abortion (28 September) Anna Błaszczak-Banasiak, Director of Amnesty International Poland, said:
354	5	Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court repealed the ruling of Roe v. Wade. It was a striking strike for reproductive rights. There has also been an extremely worrying precedent in the United States, and the consequences of this historical return can be visible too far beyond the country’s borders.
354	7	“We can find ourselves in a situation where decades of progress will be destroyed. Since the judgment has been issued, several states have already imposed a complete or almost complete ban on abortion, and other states are still discussing the issue.
354	9	This has encouraged anti-abortion activists around the world to take further steps. We can therefore expect restrictions on access to abortion in some countries in the global south, where the US has both political and financial influences,” says Anna Błaszczak-Banasiak.
354	11	“The criminalization of abortion does not prevent the need for abortion. It only makes them more dangerous. Abortion prohibitions exempt girls, women and gender-differentiated persons from making decisions about their own bodies, which in turn leads to their freedom, forced births and risks death. That’s why the rate is so high.
354	13	But in this dark vision there is a light of hope. Latin American countries, such as Mexico and Argentina, have made huge progress in the recent time in facilitating access to abortion. Northern Ireland and South Korea have decriminalized abortion, and Sierra Leone has promised to take the same action. We cannot allow the last failures in the struggle for women’s rights to shake these achievements.
354	15	“There is a strong movement of people around the world who advocate reproductive rights. We all have a role to play – whether it is by spending time or funding for abortion funds, protesting on the streets or educating people about the need for a safe abortion.
354	17	States must take a position that will enable them to find themselves on the right side of history and fulfil their international human rights commitments to protect and promote abortion rights. The only fair and safe future is in which access to abortion will be guaranteed,” said Amnesty International’s director.
354	19	Risk of Criminalization of Abortion
354	21	According to the World Health Organization, approximately 25 million dangerous abortions are performed every year (45% of all abortions in the world), of which the vast majority (97%) in developing countries.
354	23	The most affected by restrictive abortion regulations are women, girls and gender-diversified persons who are already in disadvantage due to poverty, age, disability, minority membership, migration or refuge experience.
354	25	Public health data have shown that abortion criminalization does not reduce the demand for abortion, but only makes it dangerous.
354	27	In early September, a 14-year-old girl died tragically as a result of a dangerous abortion in Morocco, where the strict abortion law enables abortion only if the life of a woman is in danger.
354	29	In Poland, the 2020 ruling of the Constitutional Court caused the almost complete ban on abortion, which seriously threatens the health and life of women and pregnant persons in need of abortion. In November 2021, the Polish human rights advocate Justin Wydrinsk was accused of helping a pregnant woman in access to abortion pills. He is threatened to three years in prison for this act. Amnesty International calls on the authorities to withdraw all accusations against Justina Udrinskaya.
354	31	Ukrainian refugees and girls fleeing the war have also been affected by the highly restrictive abortion law in Poland. They are mainly supported by local organizations that have doubled their efforts to provide assistance in an enemy and dangerous environment.
354	33	Roe v. Wade
354	35	Since the U.S. Supreme Court has withdrawn the federal protection of the right to abortion in the U.S. by revoking on June 24, 2022 the ruling on Roe against Wade, abortion has been completely or almost completely prohibited in at least 14 states and is seriously threatened in 26 of the 50 states. Some states are also seeking to introduce travel prohibitions for abortion and criminalization of abortion.
354	37	Amnesty International calls on governors across the United States to demand the cessation of abortion prohibitions and to ensure the protection of the right to abortion care in the states in which they perform their functions.
354	39	In recent decades, a strong human rights movement has emerged fighting for the right to abortion and reproductive justice. Over the past 25 years, approximately 50 countries have changed their laws to facilitate access to abortion.
354	41	Recently, abortion has been decriminalized in Mexico and South Korea, the authorities in San Marino have voted for its legalization, and Sierra Leone and Spain are on a legislative path aimed at adopting progressive abortion laws.
354	43	In the U.S. after the ruling on Roe v. Wade, mass protests occurred. Several states have taken action to strengthen the protection of the right to abortion. President Biden also signed two regulations that promote access to pharmacological abortion and support travelers to make abortion.
354	45	The coverage of the myths about abortion and the picture of the pivot related characterized all successful campaigns for the reform of the abortion law, which strengthened the rights of women and gender-diversified persons. From Ireland to South Korea, people openly shared their experiences. In Argentina and Poland, more than a million women participated in marches in which they claimed their rights.
354	47	Government Decriminalizes Abortion
354	49	Amnesty International calls on the government to decriminalize abortion. The authorities must ensure real access to safe abortion in practice and create social conditions in which people can make pregnancy-related decisions in conditions free of oppression, discrimination, tension, compulsion, violence, lack of opportunity or a system of penalties. The governments must also extend access to safe, legal and affordable abortion and contraception for all people and treat it as a duty of the state under international law.
3540	1	Baltic Pipe Terminal, Norwegian Gas Flows to Poland
3540	3	In the town of Nybro in western Denmark, the Baltic Pipe receiver terminal has been launched in early November, the Danish gas network operator Energinet said. Thanks to the investment, Norwegian gas began to flow to Poland.
3540	5	According to Energinet, “this means that Norwegian gas can affect the new Baltic Pipe and can be shipped further to Poland.”
3540	7	In the reception terminal in Nybro, to which the Norwegian Europipe II gas station is connected, the gas is cleaned, after which its pressure is lowered before further shipping.
3540	9	"Energinet reminded that the terminal was initially intended to start operating on 1 October, after which the opening date was shifted three times due to ""technical challenges"" related to IT systems and control and security."
3540	11	"""It's a huge relief for us that we managed to launch a plant in Nybro,"" the director said. International relations Energinet Torben Brabo, cited in the company’s communication."
3540	13	Earlier on 1 October, the Baltic Pipe gas pipeline supplied gas from the Danish fields in the North Sea and the European gas system.
3540	15	According to Energinet, the full capacity is 10 billion meters six. The Baltic Pipe gas will reach the end of November.
3540	17	The gas pipeline is a joint investment of gas transmission systems operators from Poland and Denmark - Gas-System and Energinet. The Gaz-System is the owner and operator of a part that starts on the coast of the Danish island of Zealand and runs to Poland after the bottom of the Baltic. 
3541	1	The weapon after the elections, as with this fascism.
3541	3	When the parliamentary elections were held in Italy, the media around the world announced the triumph of “extreme nationalism.” However, the victory of the right block is the best available remedy for Dante's native disease.
3541	5	According to official results, the winning coalition gained 43% of the votes, the strongest of which was the Italian Brothers (Fratelli d’Italia) Giorgia Meloni with 26% support, while its coalitionists scored much worse results: the Salvin League – 8.9%, and the Forza Italia Berlusconi – 8.3%. This result is guaranteed by the right-wing parliamentary majority, as the Italian system favors large blocks, and although the central and left parties have gained more votes in total, Meloni’s coalition has received 235 out of 400 mandates in the House of Representatives and 112 out of 200 in the Senate.  This is a spectacular success, given that the last time the right party won in Italy 14 years ago with Berlusconi.
3541	7	Beginnings and controversies
3541	9	The winning party was formed in 2012 from the combination of two others – the People of Freedom and the National Central Right. Historically, the party originates from the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano), which with time evolved into a conservative-national movement. The symbol of the Italian Brothers (the flame in the colours of the Italian flag) refers to this group. For these reasons, some of the criticism is justified, however, as Bartholomew Radzeevsky correctly noted, that the party has certain roots, from which it has gone many years ago, does not prove anything, because otherwise we would have to call PiS a central group, and SLD - NKWD-ovsky.
3541	11	Leadership phenomenon
3541	13	Giorgia Meloni was born in 1977 and at the age of 15 took part in political activity in the MSI youth community. At the age of 31, she became a prime minister in the government of Berlusconi, and now it is most likely the first woman in Italy's history to take the post of prime minister. On the background of a fairly monotonous Italian political scene, the dynamic figure of Meloni appears as an interesting alternative. Its views are also new – emphasizing strong conservation in ethical issues, national pride, and the criticism of the uncontrolled migration policy in recent years. Among the YouTube hits to the internet’s anal came a remix of the speech of the future Prime Minister crying: “I am Giorgia, I am a woman, I am a mother, I am a Christian!” It seems that no one would better summarize her social agenda, manifesting itself in support of the traditional family and opposition to abortion, euthanasia, marijuana legalization, marriage by LGBTQ persons, as well as the famous gender ideology.
3541	15	Eat a cake and have a cake.
3541	17	Unless the social program of the FdI does not surprise us, so many economic proposals are full of contradictions. For example, eliminating or limiting the reddito di cittadinanza, or the Italian guaranteed income in a country where the debt exceeds 150% of the GDP, would seem to be a great idea, but the leaders of the party almost one hand exchanged greater social aid for families, greater pension benefits, and a lower retirement age. Another good proposal is the linear tax for both individuals and, but the Italian Brothers are also the supporters of protectionism, and thus the protection of native products and limits on gas prices. Another attractive change is the reduction of fees for companies that hire a lot of employees (in accordance with the logic “the more you work, the less you pay”), but on the other hand, the Meloni party wants to fight with those who move their business to the European tax paradise.
3541	19	On the other hand, in the FdI economic program, we can find proposals of changes that are as positive as general: “Facilitating access to the capital market by simplifying the requirements for stakeholders who decide to enter the stock market. Providing incentives and tax relief of a structural nature to technological investments and research and development expenditure. Facilitating access to loans for small and medium-sized enterprises by strengthening the Guarantee Fund for SMEs. [...] Facilitating regulations and bureaucracy for, limiting and accelerating formalities [...]”. In economic matters, the Italian Brothers are one of the few relatively liberal options, because freedom movements in Italy almost do not exist, and the state “traditionally” interferes in the economy. In this context, any reduction of taxes, if supported by a cut of public expenditure, will be beneficial for Italy. However, such action would be a precedent in a country that has been the champion of difficulties for entrepreneurs for years.
3541	21	Traditional uncertainty
3541	23	In Italy, the parliament’s term lasts five years, but after an average of a year and a half, the Council of Ministers receives a vote of uncertainty and collapses. For example, in the previous 2018–2022 term, Italy had three governments, two prime ministers and a technical government, after which President Mattarella terminated the parliament due to a political crisis (after the departure of the Five Star Movement coalition) and called for new elections. Partly, this can be explained by the cultural aspects of a country where voters do not expect a stable power with a long-term vision, and politicians are not inclined to compromise, prefering the fall of further governments than real reforms. It is unlikely that the economic problems of Italy are attributed among others. political instability. This problem is noted to resolve the Meloni party, proposing a change from parliamentary to presidential system, argumenting that it would bring greater balance to the governments.
3541	25	EU Assertivity
3541	27	The party is characterized by strong euroscepticism, and before the elections also strong criticism of both the EU in its current form and the common currency. After winning the right-wing coalition, however, adopted a more balanced position, which emphasizes rather the defense of Italian interests in the Union rather than the divorce with it. The winning group obviously supports the vision of the Community as a homeland Europe and therefore it is highly likely that it will oppose the federal vision proposed by Scholz or Macron to show the voters that it takes care of the good of the country. Moreover, the Meloni party is not enthusiastic to the EU leaders, saying that “Europe has become a playground of France and Germany, which use European institutions to realize their own interests in harm to other Member States, and in particular Italy.” It is not surprising in such a situation the euforic reaction of the government in Warsaw – it should not be expected that Italy at the European Parliament forum will seek to punish Poland and Hungary on the issue of the rule of law.
3541	29	It is also almost certain that the new Italian government will strengthen its migration policy, as it has promised together with the Salvini group, but it is unlikely that it will enter into a more serious conflict with the Community because the country is too debtful to allow itself to lose EU funds. After Ursula von Der Leyen’s unknown speech, “instruments like in Poland and Hungary” is significant, but the answer of Giorgio Meloni is strong, stating that the words of the Chairman of the European Parliament are an interference in the Italian elections and a transcendent of the powers of the Commission, which reduces its credibility, therefore it would recommend that Brussels be cautious.
3541	31	Another problematic issue in the relations with the EU is the Italian CPO, which, as with other countries, depends on the fulfilment of a number of EU conditions. In Italy, it is a reform of justice and civil service. Former Prime Minister Mario Draghi started transforming both, but to the end still far away. Since the money from the EU fund is paid in transactions and associated with the implementation of the next steps, the right-wing government will have a strong motivation to continue the reforms of its predecessors. It is also said that Meloni will choose a renowned person as the finance minister to calm investors and EU partners about the credibility of their own fiscal policy.
3541	33	War and pro-Russian sympathy
3541	35	The change that we are most afraid of is the possible return in politics towards the Kremlin. Salvini criticized the sanctions, saying they extend the conflict and hurt Europe more than Russia, while Berlusconi directly repeated Russian propaganda, saying that “Putin was forced to invade Ukraine.” Unfortunately, Italy is traditionally pro-Russian in this regard, just like Germany. We can find similar attitudes in more “dimensional” politicians, for example. Former Left Democratic Party leader Matteo Renzi, who, as Adam Szymczyk notes, “was a member of the supervisory board of Delimobil – the largest car-sharing company operating in Russia, and his departure was forced only by Russian aggression against Ukraine.”
3541	37	It must be noted that the philosophical attitude is occupied primarily by the coalitionists of the winning party, and the Italian Brothers themselves are (as far as possible in Italy) faithful to America and NATO because of numerous contacts with the Republican Party. Meloni herself, criticizing many Draghi's government movements, has never opposed sanctions against Russia or weapons supplies to Ukraine, and in the election campaign she has consistently guaranteed that she will support our eastern neighbor. It seems that the FdI’s advantage over the coalitionists will confirm this course, and the parties will rely onining good relations with both EU and the U.S. partners. Moreover, after the Russian invasion, the majority of the Italian political scene supported Ukraine, and Italy is strongly rooted in the Atlantic world, so even with the current power it is difficult to think of greater changes in foreign policy.
3541	39	Reductio ad Hitlerum
3541	41	The victory of the right-wing block in Italy caused extreme negative reactions in the left-liberal environments, and the word “fascism” was changed by all cases. Progressive elites once again stated that “who is not with us is a fascist,” and however, such comments not only weakened support for Meloni, but even strengthened her media popularity. In the context of her winning party, it is necessary to add that since the beginning of the pandemic Italy has adopted one of the most draken measures in Europe.
3541	43	In the first months of the COVID-19 explosion in Italy, a strict lockdown was introduced, which imposed a complete ban on leaving the house in addition to three cases: buying the necessary products, contacting a doctor and driving to work. Moreover, the streets were sitting by police, checking almost every passenger who had to have a written statement containing the reason... to leave the house. In the absence of such a penalty varied between 300 and 1000 euros for individuals and 3000 euros for gastronomic locations owners. From November 2020 to June 2021 the police hour lasted between 22 and 5 in the morning of the next day. Since August 2021, it has been established. The green passport is Italian covid passport. The document was gradually extended to further activities and so in the end unvaccinated persons were not allowed to stay in: restaurants, most stores, libraries, theaters, gyms and urban communications. They could take advantage of the postal and banking services, but only if a negative test for the presence of the virus was shown. All non-vaccinated workers in the public sector were also suspended, and students without a covid passport could only attend online courses.
3541	45	This all happened during the “progressive” prime ministers – Giuseppe Conte and Mario Draghi. Giorgia Meloni herself initially didn’t take a vote, but at the 2020 and 2021 breakthrough she changed her opinion and became one of the few politicians criticizing the COVID-19 strategy in Italy. The leader of the Italian Brothers spoke straightforward about “China’s pandemic management” and pursued the elimination of compulsory vaccination. As it later turned out, the nation, tired of the sharpness, stated that government overwhelming is worse than fascism.
3542	1	Handles are evil
3542	3	Ajajajajajajaja! The rape! What will it be? Such a beautifully developing Communist revolution can fall into paroxysms that will lead to recidives. Recurrence of normality. Is this one cave the spring of the fatigued humanity, or will it be the ultimate victory of civilizations, after which the night of cruel terror will come? We don’t know this yet, but even after the knives, which came after a slight blow to the table, we see that everything is possible. I mean here Elon Musk, and actually the transaction of the purchase of Twitter. From the beginning of April to the beginning of April. He began to concentrate the shares of Twitter until he finally, after a variety of peripeties, bought 100 percent of the shares for $44 billion. It would seem that everything was in the best order; he didn’t steal, he just bought, and the shareholders sold them to him, and they didn’t give up, because someone was putting a gun on their heads. However, this transaction caused not only annoyance, but also symptoms of excitement in the totalitarian environments, so far hidden under the mask of freedom, especially freedom of speech.
3542	5	So far, Twitter’s most strict leadership was blocking the account of U.S. President Donald Trump, and he was not allowed to even break down. This incident shows that not only in North Korea, the freedom of speech has been dominated in a way that is consistent with the principles of political correctness, that is, the cultural Marxism, which has since 1968 carried out a triumphal march through the world, and at least that part of it, in which the “old and wiser” have been dominated, since the nineteenth century, remaining in the avant-garde of the communist revolution. The reading of “Twitter’s Principles” confirms in the belief that so far there could be presented only the views and opinions only correct, approved for public discourse by Sanhedrin, and executed by the volunteer Corps of Reviews of Cnoty, scratched, among other things, by the old Jewish financial grandziar Jerry Soros. What Soros has of it – it’s a separate matter – but a certain light is thrown to it by the opinion of the British intelligence agent in Petrograd, which in his diaries “On the edge of the empire” added Mechysław Jałowiecki. This agent, an educated man, a graduate from Oxford, claimed that communism is the easiest way to capture and consolidate the domination of the minority over the majority. The Jews, regardless of whether they believe in the Creator of the Universe, or regard the stories of Him as a “opium for the people”, are convinced of their purpose to exercise power over the world, and that’s why even the plutocrats belonging to this nation support the communist revolution. As we remember, after leaving out of the Bolshevik strategy, the promoters of the Communist Revolution, following the Gramsci Council, recognized that one of its main objectives is to capture the domination of the language, which serves to extend control over the education system, the entertainment industry and the media. Since the foolish goys have imposed various guarantees to their constitutions, among other things – the guarantees of freedom of speech – it is necessary to cancel them through the regulations, both on Twitter and on Youtube, which are directed by the Sugarbergs. In this way, the view was created that even market mechanisms were put into the service of the revolution.
3542	7	Meanwhile, it seems that it has fallen into a stone because Elon Musk is a supporter of freedom of speech limited only by state legislation, not by regulations established by corporate sanhedrins. So even that same day, when he became the owner of Twitter, he began to release on the bite lips of logophagists, who saved ecological niches there and reached – as the Jewish newspaper calls for the Poles – to the rule of souls, although a lot of them believe that there are no “dust” and in any case – that they do not have them. If so, the struggle for the “rule of souls” is about dominating the minds of those who acknowledge the possession of souls in order to transform them into the so-called “novation of history.” As I mentioned, it seemed that everything was moving in that direction, and at the same time, this whole Musk has made such a number!
3542	9	Therefore, it is not surprising that, after the transitions, among which there is also a criminal episode, the EU Commissioner from Slovakia, Ms. Vera Jurova, expressed a deep concern for this reason, because the European Union is nothing but the IV Rzesza, which, like the III Rzesza, is a state revolutionary formation. This similarity is expressed. in the use for the needs of the revolution of the EU institutions, just as with the German state institutions did the outstanding socialist leader Adolf Hitler. By the way, the recapitulation of Hitler’s speech at the NSDAP gauleist summit, found in the “Governments” of Goebbels on the date of 1943, can be boldly regarded as a manifest, under which all Europeans could sign today without reservations. Although Ms. Vera Jurova is deeply concerned, the philosopher Prof. Jan Hartman, who runs for Krakow, does not have an anger, in which “from the abundance of heart the mouth speaks,” that is, not so much “speaks,” that they blame with the jade of contempt and hatred. This is what he wrote: “Musk finally bought tt. There were everywhere, naziole, fanole, laughs, boys, pigs, trolls, mythomans, agents, ordinary idiots and paid curators triumph. Congratulations, goodbye!” this is how the Sermion of Freedom and Tolerance spoke. Thus came out of the “philosopher” an old totalitarian pig, wrapped with the Jewish sense of superiority. Where does it come from the devil? “From the cycling smoke?”
3542	11	It is worth reminding that Mr. Hartman, who presents himself as a “agnostic and liberal” (“I can be a leberal, but you tell me about it,” said Shmaciak’s companion), was one of the founders of the Jewish jacket, pretensibly called the “Law of the Sons of the Alliance.” What “country” can the “agnostists” believe – and it is worth adding that another founder was also running for Professor Jan Woleński, who is actually called Hertrich, what municipality was the activist of the Association of Atheists and Freemasoners? The “agnostists” are yet – indeed – but “atheists”? They can only believe in the covenant of the puppy with the bat – because of what else? Well, and of course – in the slice, especially in the situation when for the “ateism” then no one has yet escaped. A typical tandet of the Jewish handles – well, but now they have a period of good farte. Of course, for a while, however, they are not aware of it yet.
3543	1	Poseal Braun visited the German AfD and hotly urged to abolish sanctions imposed on Russia
3543	3	"The right party AfD - the ""German counterpart of the Confederation"" held a press conference yesterday in the Bundestag calling for the abolition of sanctions on Russia and ""the return to normality"". Guests from abroad were also invited to the event. Gregory Braun."
3543	5	"In the document ""Let the future of Europe"", which was presented to the media before the meeting, the AfD party explains that sanctions against Russia should be withdrawn, renewable energy supplements should be reduced, and fossil fuel taxes should be eliminated. As the AfD activists explained, “this will create a supply that will meet Europe’s energy needs at falling prices.” "
3543	7	We have a home energy crisis. Energy supply in Europe has been artificially limited, it needs to be increased again, he convinced. How? This ends with sanctions against Russia. There is no alternative to energy supply. We need to conduct a realistic policy, affirmed AfD deputy Steffen Kotre, cited by Deutsche Welle. 
3543	9	The politician explained that the rise in gas and electricity prices are responsible for the governments of the European Union, he also criticized CO2 emissions reductions.
3543	11	Foreign guests also spoke at the conference. Milan Uhrik - the leader of the Slovak Republic party, Reccino Van Lommel from the nationalist, Belgian Vlaams Belang and Gregorz Braun.
3543	13	"The Apostle of the Confederation began his speech with the words ""God's Happiness"" in three languages, then he spoke in English."
3543	15	May God bless all the patriots of all European nations who want to return to normality, who want to restore our natural, human, European laws and values. We have easily found that it connects us a lot of things and that we agree, mainly on the issue of energy supply. This is not a crisis. This is the result of the wrong actions and the wrong policy imposed on our nations,” he said.
3543	17	Braun has repeatedly said that Europe needs a way to “normality.”
3543	19	There will be no life if we don’t return to “business as usual.” “We don’t want to be in the midst of any intercontinental war with everyone for everything,” he said.
3543	21	The entire AfD conference can be viewed on YouTube. Braun's speech begins in 9 minutes. 45 seconds.
3544	1	The Nude Fuhrer. Closing of Leminga
3544	3	There are slice, linen, placed, gray, and even iron clothes.
3544	5	But some Donald Tusk has literally eliminated them from the PO menu, because he has been clustering his supporters for almost 18 years with the clusters of hatred, the clusters of thickness.
3544	7	Clusky Tuska.
3544	9	Expressively, they are not only beautiful, almost waiting, but also literally hot-to-hearted, hatred-to-hearted their electorate.
3544	11	It’s almost every day that we find it, it’s revealed through verbalism, and worse, hateful behaviors in the public space.
3544	13	Until recently, the gushes, in the last period of their cave before giving them under the knife, were further tightened- clushed to force in order to get the most proven intramuscular.
3544	15	Because not only the flavours of the glorious Strasbourg pastets were waiting for these refined pieces.
3544	17	From the clustering of the gums, the liver gained weight.
3544	19	This procedure was prohibited, as unhuman, because the guns suffered very much, for it was a torture for them.
3544	21	Clusking is prohibited, but not for Donald Tusk, who will do this since 2005, when he lost the battle with the sp Prof. Lech Kaczynski.
3544	23	The PiS election victory in 2005 even more motivated D. Tuska to clusker his electorate with hatred to political rivals.
3544	25	Through the supporters of D. Tuska, clustering increases the genes of aggression, fury, hatred, that is, everything that causes them to behave chamtic, vulgar.
3544	27	Who, when and where did the D. He is so hateful, aggressive.
3544	29	Where to Search?
3544	31	I am convinced that his 1987 essay, in which he expresses this hatred to Poland, to our tradition, to our history, to our 1000-year accomplishments, may be useful.
3544	33	For him, Poland is a gray, dirty passing room.
3544	35	This is how it is expressed about Poland, blurred by this hatred of D. Tusk to everything that is Polish, traditional, valuable, national, patriotic over Wisla!
3544	37	As he was 30 years old, he had this anti-Polish clusky in himself and publicly showed it, demonstrated through an article in Znak'u.
3544	39	It could be ashamed to assume that it was in his family’s home that began clustering with anti-polarity.
3544	41	Then the clusters received DM'Ark's omastes from those famous advertisements from Rene from the preventive Strauss.
3544	43	And it has gone!
3544	45	It went, it went, it went and it went.
3544	47	Taa! It all came out of him.
3544	49	It went on!
3544	51	And the one that was blurred, blurred by the antipolity of D. Tusk, has become no longer merely a master, but worse... a fuhrer than KLUSEK.
3544	53	Nudeln Fuhrer! Antichorism and hatred.
3544	55	It has been and has been, since it has been. The year almost every day cracks this foam of hatred, the anti-polarity of its supporters.
3544	57	It takes an average of about 16 weeks to get 5 kg of weight, as such art is considered optimal on the market.
3544	59	And how long does Donald Tusk take to exclude-close-to throw out his misleading supporter with hatred?
3544	61	In this case, unlike the extraction of the above gushes, I have a problem, because this period is strongly dependent on the individual characteristics of the leming, on how...like!
3544	63	From the degree, the capability of absorption of hate, antipolarity.
3544	65	Some, such as the murderer of Cyba, or even that scam trying to strike into the PiS office in Novogrodzka, Tusk clushed and clushed/excluded – read, he dropped with hatred at an even express pace.
3544	67	The same is the same, the same is the same, the same is the same, the same is the same.
3544	69	Another need was many years to make this clustic hatred to make them vulnerable to aggression individuals.
3544	71	It must be honestly acknowledged that there is a group of those in his elektorate that he is not, D. Tusk is able to thus to/close with hatred to send them as “strong people” to the PiS supporters!
3544	73	Why are they still voting for him?
3544	75	Here is mystery!
3544	77	pzdr
3544	79	by p.s
3544	80	Poland is the power in the harvest; about 48 thys. ton; 38 t. t. is export; Hong Kong, Germany, France. The Poles are consuming about 10 pounds. A ton is about 300 grams per year for one statistical Polak.
3544	82	Tomorrow after the Holy Mass in the garnison church of St. Catherine, passing through the Old Town, after the conclusion of the ceremony under the monument of the Marseille Joseph Pilsudsky, I invite my family and friends to dinner with a gunsin in the main role to one of the Torunese restaurants.
3545	1	Greenwashing Summit COP27
3545	3	Greta Thunberg has announced the boycott of the COP27 climate summit that begins on November 6 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. A famous activist has accused world leaders of using greenwashing.
3545	5	“COP conferences are mainly used as an opportunity for leaders and people in power to draw attention to each other using a variety of greenwashings,” Thunberg said.
3545	7	Greta Thunberg can be liked or not liked for her climate radicalism, which is often expressed in a little salonic way. However, this time it seems that there is a lot of horrible truth in her words. The first, especially strongly questioning fact, is the choice of the climate summit COP27. So Egypt is an authoritarian state and since President Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi took over the country in 2014, human rights defenders and climate activists are being persecuted.
3545	9	According to the New York Times, in Egyptian prisons, in unhuman conditions, there are 60,000 detainees. Political prisoners are estimated to be 70,000. such prisoners. Moreover, according to media reports, the various persecution of ecologists and human rights defenders has accelerated with the approaching of COP27. Thus Greta Thunberg, like thousands of ecologists and human rights activists, signed a petition calling for the release of political prisoners in Egypt.
3545	11	There is a ban on demonstrations in Egypt. In fact, the authorities have announced that they will allow ecologists to protest during the COP27, but provided that they will take place in designated places and in a significantly limited scope. You can be sure that if they happen at all, it’s not near the place of the politicians.
3545	13	It is time for the first conclusion. The foundation for the fight for the environment and climate change is the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Without stoping or even limiting global warming, it is difficult to talk about providing people in different parts of the world with conditions for a suitable living level.
3545	15	What about the fundamental rights, the right to freedom? In this light, does not the election of Egypt to the COP27 appear as a certain form of widespread greenwashing – “who we are”?
3545	17	It should also be added that ecologists from other countries indicate the high prices of participation in the COP27 and a limited number of accreditations – some of them were simply rejected. But on the background of persecution, it is more likely to be treated as “detal”.
3545	19	It seems that the world leaders, by choosing a country like Egypt to the place of the summit, disappeared from the troubled, crying activists. They will be able to peacefully, without worry, make long-lasting plans, which do not always result in what was expected.
3545	21	The final resolutions of the last year’s COP26 summit in Glasgow in a small degree presented the decarbonizing proposals drawn out in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Climate Change and the International Energy Agency. There are many examples of great commitments of which little is derived, such as the commitment undertaken at the Copenhagen Climate Summit to grant aid to developing countries to combat climate change.
3545	23	A certain symbol of these next climate summits may be the situation that appeared during last year’s COP26. There were so many private aircraft arriving at the airport in Glasgow that a correction was made. Only the first day 52 private aircraft landed. To release the airport for further machines, they had to fly empty to other airports. According to the British press, this could mean a few thousand tons of CO2 emissions.
3545	25	In conclusion, greenwashing is becoming increasingly visible over time, regardless of whether it is used by companies or politicians. It is also concerned by consumers and voters. And the actual dismissal of climate activists — regardless of the fact that they are not angels without dishonest — means a strong weakening of the social factor in the climate struggle. It is difficult to admit that without the lowest support politicians and officials themselves implement large climate projects.
3545	27	The world leaders either do not see it or do not want to see it.
3546	1	How to fight WHO?
3546	3	I wrote in a few previous texts about a criminal organization, which for a few months, unfortunately more and more effectively, is aiming to implement the plan for the creation of the World Health Ministry.
3546	5	This is no longer theory.
3546	7	Another conspiracy theory? None of these things, if someone makes it hard to read the draft treaty or the proposed changes in the IHR (International Health Regulations) records, because it includes an alternative (balanced) way of introducing changes. Let’s add, the changes to dissolve the governments of those countries that will be under pressure, and then the others, because not every president or prime minister will have such a strong will as President Trump. However, there was little to say that he was “outsourced” from this organization. As we know, the new host of the White House has revoked the majority of the decision of the predecessor. I mentioned above about stressing in the future. This is a desirable thought, because our non-government has already fallen, and in principle has fallen without struggle. If the minister of sudden death is honestly saying that he will sign with both hands under the WHO proposals, then you could say, Game Over. Fortunately, the game is not finished yet. The MZ plays with citizens in a cat and a mouse, because it does not even want to reveal the names of the people who are to represent the Polish delegation at the most important sessions, where the fate of the Poles may be decided. This is not, at least, a word for growth. If such changes are happening by the World Health Organization, we will have nothing to say not only about the next “pandemic” or “combating” them, but in many other issues that are vital for real health protection.
3546	9	The environment is free of weapons.
3546	11	The facts are that the mainstream media is silent, or they are throwing some information fool, creating the belief in the brain of their audiences that finally someone will take care of us if the state and the EU have not done too well. This is clearly euphemism, because they did not manage at all, with the kind assumption that the goal was not to kill as many Europeans as possible. When the data is analyzed, about which I write quite in detail in a few, or even a few, previous texts, the hair becomes a thumb and falls out, and the shell moderately hits the floor. If this is not genocide, what is it?The!
3546	13	Fortunately there are people who are in the heart of the good of the Poles. Divided doctors, lawyers and scientists, but also many people associated with other freedom environments. They try to highlight the banditic intentions of the criminal organization, ask specific questions about the position presented by the Polish delegation, or take the struggle on other levels.
3546	15	Not entering the details of the legal acts themselves, because the tasty records can be read by everyone, and they have also been discussed, for example, during the meeting of the Nuremberg Commission 2.0, I would like to pay attention to a few important issues:
3546	17	1. It is not enough to forget about taking a specific position by the Polish delegation in the dot sessions. Treaty or amendments to the IHR regulations
3546	19	2. The government will do what Mr. Sunday said, “they will sign with both hands under anything.” We know that this will be because we see what assertivity he has shown to the EU in climate matters, the establishment of his own law, the law 447 and the scaling of Poland on the international arena, the introduction of lies to American and Canadian tutorials, the corruption of the Prime Minister of Israel, the capitulation in the wool issue, or the systematic offensive of the Poles, the appeal of the fascists, the Nazis, etc. It’s not even a policy “on the knees”, but a shrinking face to the ground.
3546	21	3. The government supports censorship, including historical censorship and FINANCIES Anti-Polish movies, Anti-Polish events, LGBT, Barbary Engelking, Grabowski, or Grossa. It blocks and persecutes patriot activists struggling for the truth (whether they were Auschwitz prisoners, end environments, independence, or freedom).
3546	23	4. Honest doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs, uniform services and ordinary citizens are persecuted.
3546	25	5. Therefore, although it is necessary to continue the action, we cannot hope that we will change something in this matter, because they will even in the last moment pay out someone who will go and vote for the WHO Treaty. Or it will do it on Sunday himself, who is still to be exchanged and will be possible, except the murder of hundreds of thousands of Poles, his last “mission.” Then the parliament ratifies it all gratifically, because the band of four always criminally votes unanimously in every matter that generates some commitments of Poland, and already, when greater murderism comes into the game, which we had the opportunity to experience quite recently. The left and the PO (i.e. the left), demanded even greater taking the face of the Poles than PiS proposed and introducing covid passports, which could (or worse!) Control the employers as well.
3546	27	6. In what would I find chances? Not in the mind of the law, of the Constitution, in the hope, as Katarzyna Tarnawa-Govozdź says (which is of course right), that changes at the level of the IHR or the Treaty, contrary to the Constitution, will not have legal force. But what does it mean that they won’t have legal power if they have real power? Then they may be considered a common law, if the Poles ever, for example. Within 20 to 30 years they will wake up, or will it be, like in the EU, that the Constitution has no importance and the EU law, (although formally it is not so), just becomes superior to the Constitution?The!
3546	29	Therefore, the only chance to block all of this is, in my belief, a sharp and consolidated attack on WHO. It is not enough to translate what they will do to us, but to show what they have already done to us! And here I see two main types of action:
3546	31	Military attack on WHO
3546	33	   a) Presentation of actions such as:
3546	35	      Changing the definition of pandemic
3546	37	      Changing the definition of the vaccine
3546	39	      Changing the definition of collective resistance
3546	41	      – change of funding sources (first allowing the WHO to subsidize by private entities, then by corporations, and finally change of the influence structure – where most of the funds come from that second group, not from the Member States)
3546	43	      – a long-term, tragic resulting collaboration with GAVI and the Gates Foundation to excavate the countries of the Third World. And here you can give numerous examples of affer such as polio vaccines in India, Congo, Afghanistan, the Philippines – more than 70% of polio cases associated with vaccines!
3546	45	      – making rabbits experiential from people in African and Asian countries. With the malaria vaccine, the HPV virus – the vaccine of 23,000 young girls in India, where in 1,500. have occurred after this preparation fertility disorder, as well as deaths,
3546	47	      – in 2017, the DTP vaccine killed 10 times more vaccinated African children than the blonks, spider and crocodile taken together, untransplanted children,
3546	49	      – the women’s incubation trial in Kenya in 2014,
3546	51	      – during the planned pandemic, the WHO recognized abortion as one of the main problems at the time, promoting suppression of abortions and promoting pregnancy pills,
3546	53	      – supporting abortion – the 2015 guidelines have contributed to at least 3 million abortion procedures over a few years   
3546	55	b) Demonstration of corruption and economic inequality
3546	57	WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, the former Tedrosa, was able in a year (as the Associated Press investigation showed) to spend more on travel than in total on supporting the fight against AIDS and malaria. 
3546	59	      In 2009/10, a swine flu pandemic was announced. Vaccinations have killed at least a few hundred people, and for many side effects, such as narcolepsia, some countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway) are paying compensation so far,
3546	61	      “Tedros Ghebreyesus is controlled by China, which is easy to prove by calling on his first decisions on the question of the alleged pandemic,
3546	63	      Bill Gates' Impact on WHO Decisions
3546	65	 and II. Attack on the person of the Director-General by reminding the actions of the bandit who stands at the head of this mafia organization. It is necessary to pray for him, as for the rest, but the list of these “mile stones” should be published as broad as possible:
3546	67	      “Tedros Ghebreyesus was a member of the fighting group on the list of terrorist organizations.
3546	69	      During his 2005-12 ministry he did not announce three cholera epidemics and is responsible for 800,000 deaths. 3 million people,
3546	71	      – In the years 2012-16 as the head of the Ethiopian MSZ, after numerous protests, he threw people into prison and many were killed,
3546	73	      – during his first term as WHO Director-General, he retained for himself knowledge of the health situation in China after a new virus was revealed in Wuhan,
3546	75	      – the alleged pandemic was announced not in the form of a legal act, but in a press conference, on which he said that “the present state can be characterized as a pandemic,”
3546	77	      – made a series of controversial decisions, whether related to lockdown or indications on the effectiveness of masks, until the information on the effectiveness of hydroxychlorochine or the inefficiency of “vaccinations” against Covid-19 was hidden,
3546	79	      He recently made a decision, contrary to his counselors, to announce a monkey epidemic.
3546	81	Only effective information action showing these “epocal achievements” and corruption can make people aware of what we really are dealing with and that changing the status of the WHO from a advisory organization to the World Health Ministry can lead to much larger pathologies. It is not possible to recover suddenly to the value of a corrupt beast, controlled from the back seat by the Big Pharma, the United Nations and globalists, as well as it is not possible to restore the sight of a blind sheep.
3546	83	Fast, efficient and customs
3546	85	To carry out such action, you can and NEED to find allies both individual and institutional. They can already be shown today among the eurodeputates and parliamentarians of some European countries, famous lawyers, American politicians (Donald Trump, R.F. Kennedy Jr, Ron De Santis), representatives of South America and Africa. Based on historical data quickly prepare infographics showing the size of the damage caused by the WHO. It is known that the thieves will want to evaluate such materials, but you can act in a lot of places where their “stupid flies” do not reach, and in any case not immediately. This will succeed if you do it with an electronic bullet viral that doesn’t necessarily have to be fun. A lot of data collections appear in this form, and there is now the hope (limiting surely) that it will not block it at least Twitter. You can also prepare a short animation, as on their pages RFK jr did when discussing the history of vaccinations.
3546	87	There should also be a number of claims against responsible persons, for example. Mr. Tedros, or former directors and vice-directors of the organization. This should be done either in their countries or in the country of the WHO’s headquarters. It’s likely to be difficult (but not impossible) to appeal against the organization itself, because I don’t know to which court before the global Norimberga 2.0 project comes up. Could the Fujimori have an idea? In India, a 33-year-old physician was charged with the murder of a “vaccination” that was administered. This claim was directed against the “Kill Bill” itself, and it claims an unbeatable amount of $1.34 billion. Per, if the courts withdrew from the need to pay by the reason of giant court records (in Poland 8% of the value of the object of the dispute), then the bag with claims would not be solved. And in fact, if the Big Pharma bandits have moved to the secret of contracts, the clause withdrawing responsibility from them, and above all to committing genocide crimes, which is clearly indicated by the composition of “vaccinations” confirmed in 26 studies around the world, is it not necessary to immediately introduce such regulations that will maximize the investigation of justice to the victims and their families?
3546	89	You will need to get all the “content verificators” immediately, as well as immediately, because it’s often students who have no awareness of criminal liability for spreading dangerous lies. Let them spread their posts that are contrary to truth and science. Today, many pages on FakeHunter portals have been deleted just because they presented obvious propaganda with truth that has nothing to do with. I suspect that so far these Big Pharmy jackets have not been massively “pressed” by the threat of paying millions of penalties. They know perfectly that although some things will be difficult to win, the whole mass, with the present state of knowledge, would be a simple “samograe.”
3546	91	In any case, continuous international cooperation is essential. It is known that these contacts are, but more on the European or U.S. level. It should be remembered that every vote is important, and if it is easier to convince the authorities of Ethiopia than Poland, it should be done. With a well-managed propaganda action, the emphasis on the Polish government will also appear. Only people need to know!
3546	93	In other words, parafrating the well-known saying, this time you have to get through history to the heart... Here the reminder of the affairs and crimes of the World Health Organization and the appeals against the verificators will be key, as they have already since “proliferated conspiracy theories.” For example, the WHO has created a new definition of pandemic, because the old has never been, etc. All this needs to be shown accurately so that people understand what is going on, who is funding and WHO and those “verificators.”
3546	95	Of course, this is the work that hundreds, maybe thousands of people have to engage in, but they are willing now, and new ones will come if they know the truth. It is clear that the majority has long had everything “in enough,” or as the youth says, “they’ve been released” and wherever the hot water in the crane and Netflix, they won’t do anything. But this is exactly what we know from the beginning and so far has not interfered with those who want to change something, in their actions, so why should it be different now?
3546	97	Are the streets meaningful?
3546	99	Opinions are divided. Some, like Justin's Statue, say that yes. We have numerous examples of parallel actions – pressures in the parliament and “street criteria” or a small “chamber city”. This makes an impression, and the possible pacification is not obvious at all. In my opinion, the closer the elections (which clearly may not take place, but as long as they are in the ruling plans), the harder it will be for the bandits to reach for a forceful solution. After all, “walks” no one can prohibit us, and we know that in Germany they worked quite badly. There is the truth of the lasting effects for now not seen, but there is a chance that this will soon change. This kind of pressure always carries some risk of provocation. Does the government for the preservation of power, at a critical moment, not dare to introduce one of the special states? It is possible, although it seems that this is the ultimate and rather will not do it exactly in the defense of the WHO. However, it is necessary to act reasonably and not to be divided.
3546	101	Of course, you can ask yourself how much time we really have, since the WHO wants to lead to decisive votes in less than a month? We know that the winter is not favorable to the demonstrations, especially that the U.S. government has another repeat of the “pandemic” that they will try to “fire” if the situation begins to get out of control. Will people be able to regain again? Let’s hope that not.
3546	103	The rate is high, not only because there is increasingly scary information about the effects of the actions of these and other “healthy” bandits. If the latest reports from Australia, where we can read:
3546	105	“Australia’s budget has allocated $77 million to compensate victims of vaccines. This corresponds to 80 times the volume of the previous year. The government was trying to hide this amount in another part of the budget – but careful readers have discovered it. Instead of 47 people who received compensation in the last period, the money is likely to receive 4,000 people. This includes the costs of the funeral of people who have not survived the experiment.”
3546	107	This will not cover even a small percentage of the actual costs of compensation, which will be processed on the court path of many sick or families of the deceased. Moreover, in some regions, the mRNA technology is implemented in farming vaccines, which will later come to the tables of the inhabitants. How this can end, of course, no one knows. Have anyone heard any WHO protests to protect at least one country from even greater tragedy? The question is rhetorical, because this criminal organization will be deeply seconded in the implementation of everything that can excessively reduce the world’s population.
3546	109	In light of the history of the actions taken by the WHO, this is obvious even for people with strong intelligence...
3546	111	Well, at the end, I dare to remind you that this blog does not contain ads and still, although the time is difficult, I try to transmit the information that is missing in the main corner. Choosing, verifying the publications and the data contained in them requires a lot of work, so if you think it makes sense, support me (the account number is given in the box), or help me to finance the release of the book. You can read more about the project at: help.pl / last breath.
3546	113	I will also be obliged to send information and link to the collection because I would very much like to finish it with success...
3547	1	sanctions against Russia. Do they work or not?
3547	3	“The sanctions are beginning to have an increasing impact on the Russian economy, although we knew it would be delayed and it will take a few months before it starts to have effects,” says Christine Dugoin-Clément, geopolitical analyst and expert in the field of geopolitics. of Russia.
3547	5	In an interview with France Info he even tells about a “strong blow.” According to analysts, Russia’s position as a raw materials exporter has deteriorated. The return to Asia was very complicated, though due to the lack of infrastructure (trains).
3547	7	Dugoin-Clément claims that about 40% of Russia’s GDP has been affected by the withdrawal of Western companies, and the number of foreign investments in three decades has been raptively reduced.
3547	9	The replacement of Starbucks or McDonald’s with Russian “substitute” is spectacular, but it’s just a “facade” of sanctions that has a certain propaganda sense. This is what Russia is doing. In response, for example. The advertising spot, in which a Russian woman in a traditional national costume, thanks the United States for taking care of... the health of the Russians. Matuszka adds that in exchange, Russia will remove the West oil, which will force its inhabitants to walk and move, which will also benefit to health.
3547	11	Inflation in Russia exceeds 15%. What is less unnoticable from the perspective of St. Petersburg and Moscow, in the poorest regions translates into everyday life much stronger. However, Putin is directing the means of aid here and uses propaganda to play on the nuts of patriotism and the rhetoric of the shattered fortress. This is a tactic that still works but cannot be extended to infinity.
3547	13	The problem is also human resources to maintain war efforts. Here, also, the game on the node of patriotism is rapidly exhausting. They want to avoid compulsory collection due to social consequences, but the checkbook for incentives must be covered. There are signs of disadvantages in the payments.
3547	15	Dugoin-Clément claims that effective sanctions cannot be achieved without hit even in ordinary people. Punishments for politicians and oligarchs are illusions. It is Russia making elections, and these elections fall on all the people who pay a high price. The analyst says the measures are just starting to work.
3547	17	However, it should be noted that the side effects are felt in a large scale also by the countries that imposed the sanctions. In addition, taking into account the possibility of the Russian and Western people’s “picking of the belt” the balance goes to the benefit of the first ones. However, in the long run, no doubt, a much more developed West could be more quickly without Russia than vice versa. The line continues...
355	1	The Global Left
355	3	Contrary to the declared economic freedoms, the Brussels bureaucrates want to decide what goods the company is to produce and where to store them. This will ensure the liquidity of the economy and supply chain. Disorders are threatened with financial penalties. This is how the Brussels interventionism is introduced, modeled on the Chinese state capitalism. This proposal is equally harmful to the market as the eurocratists are stumbling at the address of an unacceptable electorate who chooses conservative governments. Democracy is decided by the EU bureaucrates, not by the citizens.
355	5	The ecologists were so intrigued in their green demagogy that they did not notice reality. Here, the deployment of OZE requires the simultaneous development of stable energy sources, because what will happen when the wind stops and the sun covers the clouds? Uninterrupted by this, officials do not intend to eliminate EU ETS emissions speculation as if they wanted to prove that coal energy must be more expensive than green.
355	7	Meanwhile, the energy crisis causes carbon power plants to react in many countries (Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy). In addition, the embargo on Russian coal causes it to be imported. Ecologists and Brussels bureaucratists are opposed to the increase in Brussels’ output because the decarbonization is required.
355	9	Ideological Party
355	11	According to CBS News, 65 percent. According to the survey, 31 percent of Americans expect a maximum restriction on abortion and 31 percent expect a maximum restriction on abortion. They want the right to it in all cases. This may be surprising, but it turns out that the indoctrination of the leftist and feminist environments has its limits. Furious demonstrations and narrow propaganda did not help when the economic condition is more important to the average citizen (24 percent). Instead of fighting the so-called The right to abortion (7 per cent))
355	13	This is contrary to the awareness of Brussels citizens, for whom the basic human right is abortion (at desire even for infants) and euthanasia. So the last popular in Belgium and the Netherlands. In vitro for all, euthanasia for all.
355	15	It is a paradox that in the Christian country there was only one such media-academic center as in Toruni. However, this is too much for the ambitious progressists from the Watchdog Poland. For three years, the surroundings of Turun have been violated by the courts under the pretext of not giving public information. His imaginary losses are obvious, but the captains have shown themselves in their struggle with the Catholic media. The right and the left.
355	17	And even the classic – the “Toska” of Giacomo Puccini – can be “processed” as a Christian-phobic agit, by bringing spectacular black characters into the suths of Catholic priests and – for no doubt – by putting a colour to one of them – as it was done by the progress of the Wroclaw Opera. She gained the reputation of the left-liberal media for this “attack on the church state.”
355	19	While the Brussels community does not deal with a crisis of Christian values (as it knows constitutional), the more Catholic institutions are seen as a threat to democracy – the EU is appointed a guardian of treaties and the rule of law. When societies are inserted into alternative media realities (in our country the Polish-speaking broadcasters are predicted), progressism spreads as an infection. Eurocrates are not interested in the security of the information space. Thus, the promotion of the left-liberal federation of Brussels is accompanied by the propaganda of cultural neomarxism. In this situation, Donald Tusk is deeply struggling for “European Poland.”
355	21	Human Rights
355	23	It might seem that humanity has no other problems, such as abortion, homosexuality, or social and cultural gender. The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution that qualifies abortion as a human right. Access to ‘legal abortion’ should be provided by the governments of the Member States, although this is contrary to the UN General Assembly’s resolution of 1994, when this issue was left for national decisions. Meanwhile, the latest UN resolution promotes – in addition to “safe abortion” – gender ideology, transgenderity. However, there is no doubt that the Communists did not even dream that the cultural neomarxism would have a worldwide scope.
355	25	The feminists are triumphing – free from the “procreational domination of men”, from the “motherhood slavery” – which is not disturbed by the fact that millions of girls die due to selectively abortion. They demonstrate their “right to decide about their bodies”, although the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees the protection of life. Uninterrupted by this, they do not stop in the struggle against family, marriage, maternity, traditional values, religion. They want freedom understood as a choice of sexual orientation or gender. They argue for the Istanbul Convention, which deconstrues the traditional family and values and fights the religion.
355	27	In the immersion of mankind in the civilization of death, the dimension of justice plays an important role when judges order the cessation of the processes that save human lives. They want to make euthanasia a human right like abortion. They support their progress by artists, promoting suicide and euthanasia as “good death.” The Poznan New Theatre presents the spectacle “Free Choice”, speaking for the right to suicide, with the help of local government funds.
355	29	The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has approved the Esbeck right to privileged retirement. It acknowledges the officials of compensation, referring to the chronicity of the Polish judicial proceedings (TK examines the constitutionality of the de-subjective law). As you can see, the left-wing crossing is experienced not only by the Polish transformational reformers, relativizing the decommunization, but also by the Strasbourg judges. In addition, the religious feelings of the believers are neglected when they recognize the blasphemy speech of the singer as a “free and colorful language.” Freedom of speech leads to anti-religious manifestations, and tolerance to the impunity of blasphemers. And therefore the civil legislative initiative “In Defense of Christians”, which has already been supported by more than 100,000 people. The people.
355	31	The Court of Justice of the European Union is responsible for the so-called Belarusian refugees arrested by the Polish border guard. They must be asylum in our country. Such a judgment can only be made by a disguised officer who is unknown of the realities of the hybrid war. Regardless of this, the national and Brussels jurocracy is within the jurisdiction of the legislative authority. The protest was the Polish agreement to interfere in our dimension of justice, which allowed Eurocrats to have non-contractual influence on Member States, including in the sphere of ideology. There will also be no stop for politicians, continuing the ideas of Altiero Spinelle, aiming at the implementation of the communizing superstate of Brussels under German leadership. The Russian-Ukrainian war does not interfere with them.
355	33	The controlled economy
355	35	ETS market speculations are more profitable (CO2 trading profits) than investing in stock shares. Electricity prices have risen by a few hundred percent over the past year. This is why the Brussels bureaucrates are so disappointed with the reform of the ETS system. The green revolution is more important than the rational economy. The “Fit for 55” is the “Fit for 55”. The European economy is becoming less competitive on the global market. Moreover, when the development of green technology based on the “darm energy” mice, it becomes a burden for it. However, it is not taken into account that the costs of the production and recycling of OZE devices, question their profitability. However, the lobby of green businessmen is so strong that advertising of fossil fuels is banned in France.
355	37	The Brussels automotive industry is close to bankruptcy. Not only because of the crisis and the lack of parts, but above all because of the adoption of absurd ecological standards. This would be the realization of the roots of Eurocrats who want to eliminate fuel transport by 2035. However, electric cars are at least not ecological (the need for rare metals, battery recycling).
355	39	The cost of idealized energy is the soul of the economy, but the climate-business lobby continues to struggle deeply with the so-called energy. Climate warming, although U.S. reports show that the research on it has received false data. In this situation, the Brussels bureaucrates offer electric or hydrogen-driven aircraft, while the Polish media advertises the clean energy that the wind will bring from the sea. Why not clean carbon technology? Here is the question.
355	41	Green Disappears
355	43	Without considering the food security of citizens, the Brussels bureaucrates are pushing for the limitation of agricultural production (although it is harmful to the environment). Environmental terrorism has been used. The European Union is a threat to agriculture. Characteristic that they have already managed to convince the Ukrainians to rebuild their country after the war, to adopt the guidelines of the European Green Board. Meanwhile, the EU’s local governors – pursuing climate neutrality and fearing urbanization and related communication – view depopulation as a factor favoring ecological transformation.
355	45	It is surprising the consequences with which the Brussels bureaucrates are moving towards the utopian hole, that is, the fight against the alleged climate change. They want to save the planet for nature, not for humans. This is a senseless activity when the European economy is not the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (distanted by China, India, Brazil, Russia). In addition, when carbon dioxide is not harmful, and it is produced by humans many times smaller than its natural origin – green communism has no reason to be. As for now, the consequences of the ideological decarbonization are borne by the citizens of Brussels, paying higher bills for electricity and heating.
355	47	Toughened Lamination
355	49	The ideological dictatorship of Brussels, thanks to the inclination of teachers and local governments, came into schools contrary to the will of parents, the constitutional records and the basis of programming teaching. Sexeductors, feminists, transgenderists, and also ecologists are growing, demoralizing youth. Instead of teaching – idealization, elgybetic – gender demagogy, neomacrist indoctrination. What patriotical or Catholic values there, when it is necessary to educate an illuminated citizen of Brussels.
355	51	There is a left-wing movement through the institutions. The activity of the Krakow councillors who wanted to shape the teaching program and the teaching activity of the schools, was represented by the Supreme Administrative Court, ruling that financing from the city budget for sexual education in schools is illegal. They have exceeded their powers. The educational law prohibits entrance to schools to organizations that do not have the right to do so. The ignorance of law disqualifies them as representatives of society.
356	1	PiS is part of the internationality of the radical right. He is hoping to defeat Brussels.
356	3	This is the most stupid political calculation of the Polish authorities since Konrad Mazowieck Krzyżakov brought to their land. The comment of Jacob Majmurka.
356	5	Although there is no lack of problems in Poland, Prime Minister Morawiecki has recently found the time to go to Spain. At least not to deal with some important state affairs with his Spanish counterpart, the Social Democrat Pedro Sánchez.
356	7	Morawiecki flew to the second end of Europe not within the framework of state duties, but to express his party sympathy – specifically to the far-right VOX party. Speaking at her age, the head of the Polish government feared the European Union, which he believes is turning on our eyes into a “transnational beast without actual and traditional values, without soul.”
356	9	The Moravetsky's appearance in Madrid is another example showing that the war in Ukraine has in no way changed PiS's view to European politics. The Polish government continues to link its European hopes with the increased importance of the radical right-wing parties, until recently existing on the edge of European policy, and today breaking into its main north.
356	11	The Russian issue
356	13	In Poland, the criticism of the political allies of the PiS with the European extreme right is most often referred to the pro-Russian sympathy of the party on which the ruling camp in Poland puts.
356	15	In fact, on the radical European right there is no shortage of the forces of the powered, at least until recently, with admiration in Putin – like the Italian League of Matteo Salvini – or having questioning Russian ties, like the National Union Marine Le Pen.
356	17	Among the PiS allies, however, there are also forces that have taken a decisive position over the past few months against aggression, e.g. The Italian Brothers. Their leader, Giorgia Meloni, strongly supports military aid to Ukraine, although she has recently written in her book about Putin as “the defenders of Christianity.”
356	19	The problem with PiS’s involvement in the internationality of the extreme right is, however, not just about the latter’s relationship with Putin. It is also worried what its leaders say about Europe and what social-civilizational order they want to build in it.
356	21	Under the four stands
356	23	This internationalism does not have a coherent, explaining the world of ideology. However, it is gathered under four common stands.
356	25	The first is the Nazi stand. This Naziism is expressed in two layers: the relationship to migration and to those citizens who are descendants of migrants. In principle, all radical right-wing parties want to strengthen European borders, if not to close them, primarily for the migration of the poor inhabitants of the global southern countries.
356	27	From the Spanish VOX through the French National Union to the Hungarian Fidesz, the PiS allies build their support, scared the voters of migration and its consequences, presenting it as a source of many threats: from small crime to Islamic terrorism to a threat to the civilizational identity of Europe.
356	29	These fear campaigns include often long-lived post-migrant communities in Europe. For the radical right is more or less openly convinced that the right Europe is a white and post-Christian Europe, and if people with a different identity have a permanent residence in it, then they should remain unseen to the maximum.
356	31	Native campaigns are accompanied by conspiracy theories, for example. This is a major replacement – the conspiracy of the cosmopolitan elites, who want to replace the “born” population of Europe with migrants that will be easier to manipulate and govern. This theory was repeatedly defended by Giorgia Meloni.
356	33	The second stand is nationalist. This nationalism is primarily directed towards the European Union. The whole radical right is opposed to a deeper political integration of the Union, as it can be judged by the statements of its leaders, would even want its withdrawal.
356	35	At the same time, the Radical Right has not formulated its clear idea of how its right-wing Union should look – the PiS allies know only that they do not want strong Community institutions, new competences for the European Commission, common human rights standards or the mechanisms of the rule of law.
356	37	However, the nationalism of the new radical right also has its own internal dimension. In VOX, it means a strong hostility to the national aspirations of the Basques and Catalonians. VOX proposes in its programming documents a change of Spain’s structure from a quasi-federal – today the state is divided into 17 autonomous communities – to a unitary. Spain is, in spite of all its cultural and linguistic diversity, the homeland of “the Spanish nation that remains inseparable in its unity.”
356	39	The third stand is the stand of cultural reaction. Parties such as VOX, Italian Brothers, PiS, or at least the French National Union are not conservative but reactive parties. They reject the cultural change that has occurred in the West in the past half a century, they dream of a reversing “conservative revolution.”
356	41	So they will fight the gender ideology, they will scare the world, in which in a moment we will be afraid of using such words as mom and dad, the state will put into jail for claiming that there are only two gender, and trans activists will force to change gender to children.
356	43	They appeal to Christianity, but wiped out of any ethical content, brought into the role of the totem, distinguishing their own from the strangers. “Christian values” are also used as a justification for the social subordination of women or the violation of the rights of the LGBT+ community.
356	45	Finally, the fourth standard carries anti-elitary content. The anti-elitarism of the modern radical right, the anger that it mobilizes against the cosmopolitan, liberal elites of politics, science, culture and business, allows to gather the problems raised under the three previous stands and shed them the face of the enemy: Soros, Bill Gates, Macron, Tusk, Ursuli von der Leyen.
356	47	Interestingly, this retorical anti-elitarism does not necessarily have to be translated into a economic program that really takes into account the interests of the poorest part of society.
356	49	The radical right in Europe does not have a coherent economic program today. Some of the forces that make it use the growing inequality, the fear of the people’s classes of losing positions and the social and material degradation; others refer rather to the middle class’s anger that politics is too strongly focused on the needs of the poorest people.
356	51	Meloni promises the abolition of the Government’s 5 Star Movement’s “Civil Income”. It is not the true basic income, it is only a form of conditional support for the poorest unemployment families, an average of €567 a month, but still this benefit was criticized by Italian entrepreneurs as disrupting people to work. Among the entrepreneurs, the Italian Brothers gained 30 percent. The number of votes is 4 percentage points more than the total population.
356	53	Read more about Madame Le Pen
356	55	The Italian brothers come from the post-fascist environments, the VOX from the post-francist environments – although often perimated in the main north of the Spanish People's Party.
356	57	There is no such genealogy. It comes from the environment of the Center Agreement, which in the 1990s was founded as a Chadic party. Although the Agreement had an exceptional tendency to political manicism, conspiracy theories, insinuational-paranoic style of policy, it was still in the main corner of the Polish right. As it was basically in it at the beginning of PiS, although the tendency of this party to paranoid-script narratives was even greater than the PC.
356	59	The PiS, growing in strength, attracted at the same time reactive open environment, circulating around the father Rydzik, the traditional nurses of Catholicism or deriving from such parties as the Christian-National Union. They are gradually changing the face of a party, which at the same time, on its own desire, disappears from the main corner of the European right. Distance turns into an open conflict when a dispute with European institutions about the rule of law begins.
356	61	Today, starting from other starting positions, PiS is in the same place as the radical European right with a often post-fascist linearity, throwing out all the four characteristic stands for it.
356	63	As for the stand of cultural reaction, PiS is radical even on the background of its new political family. When the Supreme Court of the United States withdrew the right to abortion from the Americans, the proposals were made in France to incorporate this right into the constitution. Marine Le Pen then declared that she could vote for such a proposal, although she does not see the need to amend the fundamental law, in a situation where no serious one in France proposes an abortion ban.
356	65	Of course, behind this declaration stable political calculations, Marine Le Pen itself even ten years ago criticized “abortion on request”, and in her party continues to act openly enemy to women’s reproductive rights. Nevertheless, this is a clear contrast on the background of the PiS, which, contrary to the social mood and its own political interests, took the Poles, by the hands of the Prilub Court, almost entirely their reproductive rights.
356	67	PiS is also undoubtedly a nationalist standard, which we could see for the first time during the 2015 refugee crisis, and last with the story of how the government narratically played the refugee crisis at the border with Belarus.
356	69	At the same time, in the case of PiS, nazism was always balanced by the openness to wage migration from Ukraine and other cultural areas near Poland. After Putin's attack on Ukraine, the government opened wide doors to refugees from that country.
356	71	Without any nuances, the PiS raises the anti-elitarist stand. From the plots generosely supported by state treasury companies, the weekends are scared by Soros and Gates and other characters appearing in the stories of the European radical right. In the Polish version in the attack on the elites we get only sometimes in the package of allegedly earning too many doctors or an “extraordinary cast” of the judge.
356	73	Europe is not friendly to life.
356	75	The PiS is most intense with an anti-European stand. It consistently raises the conflict with Germany and initiates an increasingly sharp anti-Yunian rhetoric. Departure from the government as a moderate minister. European affairs Konrad Szynyński signals the likely exacerbation of the course on the dispute about the rule of law and the fact that the KPO’s measures before the elections will simply not be available.
356	77	And this is the reason why PiS fetishes in Warsaw Marine Len Pen, and the prime minister runs to the other end of the continent to stand on the edge of the opposition party. PiS seems that the best way for Poland to get out of the dispute with Brussels is to take power in Europe by parties such as the Italian Brothers – the more similar governments, the smaller the field of maneuver for the European Commission in relations with countries such as Poland or Hungary.
356	79	This is the most stupid political calculation of the Polish authorities since Konrad Mazowieck Krzyżakov brought to their land. And unfortunately not because the radical right has no chance to significantly gain greater influence on power in Europe – because unfortunately it seems to grow into force. VOX is the third force in the Spanish parliament, the Swedish Democrats have become the party from which the central-right governments in Stockholm will depend, and the French National Union has broken this year for the first time the Republican “sanitary cord”, which so far effectively stopped representatives of that party before obtaining mandates.
356	81	The plan is foolish for another reason. Europe, which would be built by Orbán, Le Pen, Meloni or Moravecki with VOX leader Santiago Abascal, would be a much less friendly place for Poland and the Poles.
356	83	To turn Europe into the field of national selfishness—which would actually result in the weakening of community institutions and the disintegration—a country with such a potential as Poland could only lose. Of course, PiS would get a free hand from such a Europe to build its “non-liberal democracy” here, but Poland would not receive solidarity and support from such a Europe in the matters that are most vital to our interests.
356	85	Europe governed by the PiS allies would also be a much more spiritual, authoritarian place where human rights – especially women and minorities – would swim in our eyes. Where politics, understood as the establishment of democratic consent for changes to build common good, would ultimately be replaced by the logic of cultural war, driven by resentments, conspiracy theories and paranoia.
356	87	For such Europe PiS is struggling today – all so that in the country, without looking at the EU institutions, and even the Polish constitution, Kaczynski has a free hand in subordinating another institutions and imposing a society close to his ideological agenda.
356	89	The problem of the PiS alliance with the radical European right is really not limited to what the new PiS allies say about Putin. Unfortunately.
357	1	It begins. New horrendous tax in the name of “global warming fight”
357	3	The Netherlands will drastically raise the air tax for every passenger leaving the country. This means that there will be no cheap travel. This is how officials, as they believe, fight global warming.
357	5	From 2023 each ticket for a departure from the Netherlands will be charged with a tax of 28,58 euros, which is about 135 PLN. Tax - at least for the moment - will not be subject to arrival to the Netherlands or transfer flight, i.e. with a transfer to Amsterdam.
357	7	In practice, this means the end of cheap flights. In the promotions you could buy a ticket from the Netherlands to Poland or elsewhere in Europe even for 40-60 PLN. In a few months, it will be 2-3 times more the tax itself for the purchase of the ticket.
357	9	The authorities interpret this in such a way that, thanks to the horribly high tax, people will not fly on short routes, because it will not be paid. And if they don’t fly, the global warming will stop, so everyone will live long and happy. The naivity of the ecologists does not know boundaries.
357	11	The Netherlands is the European pioneer in the fight against climate change. For several months there have been sharp protests by farmers, whose crops are practically intended to be destroyed, and the global warming is a pretext.
357	13	As part of the heroic climate struggle, the maximum speed allowed on highways during the day was limited to 100 km/h (from 130 km/h). This will cause less nitrogen oxide to get into the atmosphere.
357	15	Some Dutch cities have already banned public advertising of products and services related to fossil fuels. This is m.in. Prohibition of advertising for fuel cars or holiday flights. In addition, the first city banned the advertising of meat. And this is only the beginning of the changes introduced under the pretext of the fight against global warming. This is the so-called future. The elite, and everything for our good.
358	1	Fighting “ecologists” with fossil fuels and cars as fighting winds
358	3	For radical environmental activists, the collision with reality is equally radical and at the same time very painful. The current economic and political situation has revealed the tenderness of the ideological doctrines seeking to force the European societies to violate the so-called transition. Non-emission sources of energy. In Germany, it has also turned out that people do not intend to give up the cars, even in the younger generation, on which these “ecoprocks” have been working hard for years. Not much of this, it’s just above Ren and Laba that most often fossil fuels become the only rescue for the urgent need to generate electricity for vehicles located in the middle of the highway.
358	5	How is it with coal?
358	7	From 1 October 2022, two German energy companies (RWE and Leag) reboot additional blocks in power plants. These blocks are powered by brown coal. An explanation for such a decision is the need to ensure the energy security of the country. Currently, the authorities in Berlin do not resign from the vision of leaving carbon in energy by 2030, but it’s hard to expect that from the mouth of the Minister of Economy and Climate Protection of the “Green” party Robert Habecka can come other words.
358	9	The German “Green” did not promise these things to their voters. The era of cheap gas from Russia, purchased for the pleasure of the Kremlin, has probably ended, and the coalition now ruling the Federal Republic of Germany has to cut the material as reality allows it. Of course, the coalition of the Social Democrats, the FDP and the “Green” could have had previous warnings on the climate struggle, but its fate would be forecast in the upcoming winter. A new distance to the energy revolution is felt not only over Ren and Laba, but also over Tamisa. The British authorities have just announced that the upcoming COP27 conference will miss King Charles III, previously known for his commitment to promote this agenda.
358	11	The result of the September stress test, a simulation of the circumstances threatening energy security, which resulted not only in the recommendation of the reaction of coal blocks in power plants, but also in the maintenance of the work of three nuclear plants until the end of the heating season, that is, until April 2023.
358	13	Germany does not want to leave the cars.
358	15	Everything indicates that the German society, despite the year-long harvest of public opinion by a variety of “ecologists”, approaches the ideas of the “green world” ideologists with a great reserve. Not only does he want to live the winter in warm houses (the cost of CO2 emissions from carbon power plants), but he also does not want to give up having private cars.
358	17	In the online edition of the German “Focus” you can read about it in the article pt. “Why green transport policy completely ignores reality?” The information provided by “Focus” shows that ideally dictated ideas of the transport revolution, which consist of preferring public communication and imposing various restrictions on private cars, are not too much accepted in Germany. As we read on the web pages of this letter:
358	19	“The missions of many politicians and stakeholders, especially green politicians, aiming to change road transport appear to have little to do with the reality of the residents of Germany. Because despite the increased cycling in the coronavirus pandemic, despite the success from the point of view of many observers the ticket for 9 euros and despite the high outcomes of the sale of vehicles with alternative engines, such as electric cars: the car itself remains “the favorite child of the Germans”. This can be seen from the numbers themselves. The Federal Bureau of Statistics in 2021 charged 580 cars per 1000 inhabitants. Over the past 10 years, the number of cars has increased. In 2011, there were 517 cars per 1000 inhabitants.
358	21	From this it seems that even the Germans who are susceptible to the upper decisions and orders don’t want to get rid of the civilizational conquest, such as having a private car, which gives freedom of movement and greater stability of operation in uncertain communications times.
358	23	Polish followers – the clinical case of Krakow
358	25	The “green policy”, which seems to be in the back of our western neighbors, is still launched in Poland, especially in large cities. The local government appears to act as something intrigued or even opposition to the political line of the government. An example of the difference between the declared and actual transport policy is the second in terms of population city in Poland – Krakow. These left-wing authorities like to experiment with changes in transportation, developing new concepts to justify the expulsion of private cars from the city. The area of paid parking already reaches some settlements considered peripheral. Key communications lines are closed (example of the Grzegorzecká street and planned changes to ul. Ancient) or swing to a minimum passability (Dietla streets, Silesian Rebels, Bratysławska, Kalvaryjska, Stojalovsky, Aleja 3 May etc.)
358	27	At the same time, with the expansion of paid parking zones and the high costs of parking rates, the city is unable to fulfill its promises and build parks such as “Park and Drive”, not to mention the long-loved underground parks. Large infrastructure investments, such as tramways to the National Mountains and the Azores, Pychovicka and Zwierzyniecka Routes, or new agglomerative connections to the sub-Krakov towns, are either delayed to later, and if they are already implemented, then they catch increasing delays and generate further unpredictable costs. It is important to note that following the so-called Eco-mode, under Wawel was also decided to implement another way of dismissing drivers to enter the city, i.e. the Zone of Clean Transport. In this area, which covers most of the city’s key streets, it is expected to be gradually prohibited the movement of any cars that do not meet different emission standards.
358	29	The cover of environmental care, including the provision of clean energy, is the fulfilment of the international objectives set by the failed and ineffective organization that has become the United Nations. The United Nations policy is called on. The largest metropolitan city in Poland, Górnośląsko – Zagłębiowska Metropolia, declares:
358	31	“In 2015, the United Nations Member States adopted the Agenda 2030 containing 17 Sustainable Development Goals, among others. fighting poverty, providing clean energy, environmental care, and more sustainable cities. Metropolia is already realizing many of these goals, which can be read in the report, which was published on the occasion of the World Urban Forum in Katowice in June.”
358	33	The “ecological” acceleration and increased demand for cars resembles the German commitment to the elimination of coal and nuclear energy. About the social effects, the impact of eco-politics on the condition of families and the conversion of the costs of various energy transformations on citizens no one in the spheres of power is concerned.
358	35	The struggle against private cars is a widespread struggle against private property – individual transportation is to be limited to the maximum, and the citizen is to be convicted of collective communication. On the question of how to communicate the growing areas of “white spots of communication” in Poland, no one can answer. Therefore, the struggle for equal – or even rationally friendly – treatment of collective and individual communication is a struggle for civil rights.
358	37	Enlightenment is permission to ecological madness.
358	39	The threat arising from the agenda “Europe 2050” and “Agenda 2030” of the United Nations is seen especially now, facing the threat to the security of citizens before the coming winter. Should we wait for a communication paralysis after the ideas of the “green politicians” disappear, fighting with coal, fuel cars and nuclear energy while fleeing the responsibility for existing and future crises?
358	41	An example of an active awareness to the public of the dangers associated with ecological madness is a social action initiated and coordinated by the Association of Christian Culture under the title “We will not give cars!”
358	43	Referring to the Poles, the initiators of the action say:
358	45	“The new regulations adopted by the European Parliament require that fuel vehicles may not be registered or manufactured by 2035. With the proposal for “ecological” zero-emissions, the European Union is lobbying for the introduction of electric cars, not counting on the real costs of such a decision for the Member States. We have a vision of a significant limitation of the possibility of owning a car for many of our neighbors, and what follows the limitation of access to work, schools. The new rules are, as a consequence, the withdrawal of citizens of mobility, which may result in the impossibility of getting a better position, the lack of the possibility of immediate response in emergencies related to personal and social life. This pseudo-ecological initiative also does not count on a serious problem of electrophystic elimination. Fuel cars, unlike electric cars, have a relatively longer duration and driving capacity and are easier in processing, which does not harm the environment to ecological disasters. Can we agree to make us and our children poor, so that a stranger realizes his vision of the world with us?”
358	47	It would be good that this call not only reaches as many people as possible, but it would also be read by politicians. Why are they? This is because they are most often in touch with the allegations of hypocrisy and observation when they abuse aircraft service flights, in particular for international conferences that address climate warming issues, and also generally benefit from the convenience of private transportation and generate high costs for the operation of their administration. These people themselves at the same time fight winds (not counting those generating a little electricity), positioning themselves on pioneers in reducing carbon emissions and other substances into the atmosphere. Living in such a way – which is easy to understand, because even politicians in the end are just people – they should rather be the first signatory of the petition to defend private transportation.
359	1	Poland threatens recession without EU funds
359	3	Kaczynski, Morawiecki and Ziobro again steal the Poles and the Poles with the money they belong to – said Levica politicians during a press conference on which they commented on the media reports that the European Commission will sacrifice funds to regional projects because the current government does not fulfill the promises related to the reform of justice in Poland.
359	5	Where is the $770 million for the UK?
359	7	That money may not be just because Zyobro, Morawiecki and Kaczynski decided to denounce the war of the European Union. It is not the EU today is an enemy and a problem, the problem today are the crazy food and energy prices, as well as the rising rates of loans. These are the problems of millions of families who are wondering how to link the end to the end. Moravecki, Kaczynski and Ziobro are fighting the winds today. It’s not the Germans, it’s not the LGBT, it’s not the leftist are guilty of not having that money. PiS is trying to distract the attention of the public by sharing it,” said deputy Christof Śmiszek. 
359	9	As he emphasized during the crisis, the PiS government first broke the issue with the National Rehabilitation Plan, and now it may lack money from the Cohesion Fund. “Under the sign of demand are huge money, hundreds of billions of zlotys for Poland’s development,” he said.  
359	11	A few months ago, the Prime Minister said that the money from the EU is Polish state reason. So if that money doesn’t flow, it means that the head of the government has betrayed the Polish righteous state. Forgetting money from the KPO is a giant sin, but giving money from the structural funds is a deadly sin. Which Prime Minister has the ideas to unlock that money? And the condition for the recovery of these funds is the rule of law, free courts and independent judges. One of the criteria for receiving money from the European Union is compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including the right to an independent court. What are the guarantees today that in Poland we have free courts and independent judges, since the Supreme Court has installed a Disciplinary Chamber under a modified shield? 
359	13	KPO – 58.1 MLD EUR
359	15	The lack of funds from the European Union may lead to a recession in Poland. - 770 billion zlotys of EU funds waiting for Poland will only be 2% of the GDP growth next year. Thus, only EU measures can save Poland from falling into a deep recession,” said Dariusz Standerski, Ds. The Left Legislative Club.  
359	17	The actions of the government are subjected to meaningless propaganda, President Kaczynski claims that the money from the EU is merely margins that he does not see these measures. And at the meeting, on which he said this, he was driving the A1 highway built with EU funds. PiS has not noticed that the European Union has funded 296 thousand investments throughout Poland, for more than 1 trillion 200 billion zlotys. This is the amount that has caused a civilizational jump in recent years. The actions of the government lead to the fact that there is no next jump in Poland, the expert assessed. 
359	19	Poland will not be able to do it without the EU, but the EU will be able to do it without Poland. The Poles with the money from the Union will die, health protection will not help without these funds. The members of the PiS government will be treated, but the ordinary Poles will no longer be treated, the deputy Pavel Krutul said.
