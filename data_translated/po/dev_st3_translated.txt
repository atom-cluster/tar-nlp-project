25106	1	Greta Thunberg on Climate Crisis
25106	3	Earth Day: Greta Thunberg on climate crisis
25106	5	In a passionate list, the 18-year-old Sweden explains why world leaders have to take more radical actions to prevent disasters.
25106	7	Greta Thunberg was only 15 years old when she began weekly protests in August 2018 in front of the Swedish parliament in Stockholm. She could not understand why no one is talking about how big the climate crisis is. Since then, the 18-year-old activist has mobilized millions of people to go out and has become one of the most recognizable faces of the environmental movement in the world.
25106	9	On Earth Day, April 22, 2021, at the climate summit organized by U.S. President Joe Biden, the leaders of the countries participating in it will present new commitments on climate crisis, including the project to zero emissions by 2050. When we compare what the latest scientific achievements offer us with the so-called climate goals, we will see a serious gap – where we really need to act, we have a decades of delay.
25106	11	Of course, all actions should be supported to ensure a safe future and to protect against the deterioration of living conditions. The goals presented at the top could be a great starting point, if not a small detail – full of holes and legal crackings. such as avoiding emissions from imports of goods, aviation and international transport and biomass combustion. They enable the manipulation of the output data, the exclusion of feedback and critical points, the ignorance of the key aspect of fair distribution and historic participation in emissions. For this reason, these targets depend entirely on abstract calculations and practically unavailable technologies. I don’t have time to get into details.
25106	13	The thing is that we can continue to take advantage of the creative carbon emission accounting and cheat in our calculations to pretend that the set goals are exactly what we need now. However, we cannot forget that although it is possible to deceive others, and even ourselves, nature and physics cannot be deceived. No matter whether we will carry out calculations fairly or not, emissions are a fact.
25106	15	People in power are not attracted to responsibility, because the awareness of this issue is still small. This is the seed of the problem. If you call their commitments “due” or “ambitious”, you don’t understand to the end how serious we are.
25106	17	I met many world leaders. Even they themselves acknowledge that the goals they set are not in accordance with the obligations they have undertaken. It is completely natural. They do only what they think is possible in the context of the political situation. Their task is to meet the wishes of the voters, and if the voters do not demand real action to stop the climate disaster, it is obvious that nothing will change. That’s how democracy works. This public opinion governs the free world. If we want change, we need to raise social awareness and show that what seems impossible can become possible.
25106	19	We understand that the world is complicated, that many people do what they can, and what we need is not easy. Of course, even insufficient goals are better than nothing. But we can’t satisfy something just because it’s better than nothing. We have to do more. We need to believe that we are able to do it – and we really are. If we unite and set a certain goal, the impossible things will cease to exist.
25106	21	I am not ready to give up.
25106	23	The world’s leaders are giving up to the 1.5°C target. They give up their promises and our future. I don’t know how you, but I know I’m not ready to give up. I will never give up. We will fight for a safe future. It’s important even a break of degree, it’s always going to be important.
25106	25	You can say that we are naive, believing that change is possible. OK in order. But at least we are not naive enough to think that our problems will be solved by countries and companies that set general, distant and insufficient goals, unless they meet pressures from the media and the public.
25106	27	The gap between what we have to do and what we really do is increasing from minute to minute. The gap between the necessary actions and the level of awareness and attention devoted to the problem is becoming more and more absurd. And the gap between the so-called climate goals and the scientific solutions available now should not be ignored.
25106	29	These gap in actions, consciousness and lack of time are the most obvious problem that is not discussed. A real change will not be possible until we deal with it. Without specific action, we will not find a solution.
25106	31	The king is naked – let’s end with that eye.
25107	1	“We, children, should not do that. But because almost no one does anything, we have to do it.”
25107	3	Greta Thunberg is a sixteen-year-old woman who struggles for climate. In a strike before the Swedish parliament, she posted a post on Facebook in which she responds to the allegations against her.
25107	5	Greta also celebrated her speech at the UN Climate Conference in Katowice, as well as the recent summit in Davos. It has become a symbol and inspiration for the youth strike in the streets of Brussels.
25107	7	We invite you to read the post we translated into Polish:
25107	9	“I have recently seen a lot of blades about me and a huge amount of hatred. This is not a surprise for me. I know that since most people are unconscious of the full significance of the climate crisis (which is understandable because it has never been treated as a crisis), the school strike for the climate seems very strange to the general. So let me explain the matter of my school strike.
25107	11	In May 2018, I was one of the winners of a text contest on environmental protection organized by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. My article was published, and some contacted me, among others Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland. He had a group of people, especially young people, who wanted to do something with the climate crisis. I had several teleconferences with other activists. The aim was to present ideas for new projects that will draw attention to the climate crisis. Because he had a few ideas about the things we could do – from marches to a loose idea of some kind of school strike (school age children would do something on school fields or in classrooms). We were inspired by Parkland students who refused to go to school after school shootings.
25107	13	I liked the idea of school strike. So I developed this idea and tried to encourage other young people to join me, but no one was really interested. They thought that the Swedish version of the Zero Hour March would have a greater impact (to society – red.). That’s why I myself planned a school strike, and then I didn’t take part in any meetings.
25107	15	When I told my parents about my plans, they didn’t like it much. They did not support the idea of a school strike and they said that if I did, I would have to act alone and without any support.
25107	17	On August 20, I sat in front of the Swedish parliament. I’ve distributed notes with a long list of facts about the climate crisis and explains why I’m striking. The first thing I did was to post on Twitter and Instagram information about what I’m doing, and soon it became a viral.
25107	19	The journalists and newspapers began to come. One of the first was Swedish climate traffic entrepreneur, Ingmar Rentzhog. He spoke with me and made the photos he posted on Facebook. This was the first time I met him or talked to him. I have not talked to him before, nor have I met him before.
25107	21	Many people like to spread rumors that I have people “for me” or I’m “payed” or “used” to do what I’m doing. But there’s no one for me, except me. My parents were as far from climate activists as possible before I realized the situation.
25107	23	I am not part of any organization. Sometimes I support and work with a number of non-governmental organizations working for the climate and the environment. But I am absolutely independent and I represent only myself. And I do what I do completely for free – I have not received any money or any promise of future payments in any form. No one is connected to me or my family. And of course it will remain so. I have not met any climate activist who would fight for climate for money. This idea is completely absurd. In addition, I only travel with the consent of my school and my parents pay for tickets and accommodation.
25107	25	My family wrote a book together about our family and how I and my sister Beata influenced the way our parents thought and viewed the world, especially when it comes to the climate. and our diagnoses. This book was supposed to be published in May, but because there were serious misconceptions with the company to publish it, we eventually changed the publisher. This book was released in August. Before the book was published, parents announced that the potential profits from the book “Scener ur hjärtat” will be transferred to eight different charity organizations – environment, children with diagnoses and animal rights.
25107	27	I write my own speeches. But because I know that what I will say will reach many people, I often ask many people for support. I also have a few scientists, whom I often ask for help in expressing some complicated issues. I want everything to be absolutely correct, not to spread incorrect facts or things that may be misunderstood.
25107	29	Some people laugh at me because of my diagnosis. Asperger is not a disease, it is a gift. People also say that if I have Asperger, I can’t put myself in such a position. But that’s why I did it. Because if I were “normal” and companion, I would be organized in an organization or I would have founded an organization myself. But because I’m not so good in contact with people, I did it instead.
25107	31	I was very frustrated that nothing was done in connection with the climate crisis and I felt I had to do something, whatever. And sometimes NOT doing anything – like sitting in front of the parliament – says a lot louder than doing something. Sometimes it is more loud than the scream.
25107	33	There is also an accusation that “I’m screaming and writing as an adult.” I can only say: Do you not think that a 16-year-old can speak for himself? There are also people who say that I simplify things. For example, when I say that “the climate crisis is a black and white matter”, “we have to stop greenhouse gas emissions” and “I want to panic.” But I say that only because it is true. The climate crisis is the most complex issue we have faced. To stop this requires full effort.
25107	35	But the solution is black and white – we need to stop greenhouse gas emissions. Because we either limit the warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in relation to the state before the industrial revolution, or not. Or we reach a critical point where we begin a chain reaction – with events that are beyond man’s control – or not. Whether we survive as a civilization or not. There is nothing between survival.
25107	37	And when I say I want panic, I mean that we have to treat the crisis as a crisis. When your house is burning, don’t sit and talk about how easy you can rebuild it when you burn the fire. If your house is burning, go out and make sure everyone has gone out when you call the firefighters. This requires a certain level of panic.
25107	39	There is another argument that I can’t deal with. It’s the fact that I’m “only a child and we should not listen to children.” But it’s easy to fix – just start listening to solid learning. For if everyone would listen to the scientists and the facts I’m constantly referring to, no one would have to listen to me or any of the hundreds of thousands of school-age children who strike for climate around the world. Then we could go back to school.
25107	41	I am just a messenger, but I receive all that hatred. I’m not saying anything new, I’m just saying what the scientists have repeated for decades. And I agree with you – I’m too young to do it. Children, we should not do that. But because almost no one does anything, and our future is in danger, we feel that we have to continue.
25107	43	And if you have other concerns or doubts about me, you can listen to my TED lecture (https://www.ted.com/.../greta_thunberg_the_disarming_.../up-next), in which I tell you how my interest in climate and environment began.
25107	45	And thank you all for your good support! It gives me hope.
25107	47	Greta »
25114	1	"the EU. Tusk received a ""order to Poland"""
25114	3	"“Now my way, Donald, you’ll return to your country to defend your values again. ...when we meet again, we will see you, as you said, as a prime minister.""Less more so, because I quote from memory, Ursula von der Leyen said goodbye to Donald Tusk when he left his office in Brussels, and more precisely when he was dismissed from the post of EPL chairman, from the last fuchy that the EU gave him. Not without a reason, Tusk was reminded that he was returning to the country to defend “values”, which clearly proves that the EU doesn’t like today’s Poland. Tusk had an immeasurable mine, because in a sense he was thrown to work, which he never got to do, but graciously smiled for that heard return, “the way of Donald.” This “roads” can be literally understood, the Turkish office cost a lot to the Union, but not everything happened in Poland as if the Union wanted it."
25114	5	The picture described showed 06.07.’22 TVP in evening news. We had shown there “as on the hand” that Tusk received from the EU a “order to Poland”, that he was sent here in order to, democratically or undemocratically, it is unimportant for the contractors, restore liberal governments in our country. This is another evidence of what the EU today is, what its “values” are preferred, how it understands democracy and how it treats free and independent states. And all this happens in the light of the cameras, in the presence of many prominent EU decision makers and clearly shows that democracy and the rule of law are for today’s EU decision makers just empty slogans that are interpreted as it is convenient for these decision makers. We did not join the EU in 2004. No one then predicted us that a democratically elected government would blame on the street, that high officials, uncomfortable to the liberals, would be forced out of office (the presidents of the NBP and the TK), and such actions predicted Donald Tusk already “masted” by Ursula von der Leyen on the future Prime Minister of Poland. And this is said by people who, with their mouths full of “rule of law”, “democracy” and ordinary human “justness.” As you can see, this right fairness, rule of law and democracy must be sought there with the candle.
25114	7	The reports also reminded the judgments issued by the TSUE, a court which is the last rescue plate for the Levatic liberals when their other methods used to subordinate the individual states are missing. This alleged only court authorized to judge what is the rule of law in the EU and what is not, appears to be extremely unfair and extremely unobjective to the European Court, whose main task is to judge in accordance with the interests of Germany and a narrow group of EU decision makers, who have granted themselves the right to lead the Union in a completely different direction than those that prompted its establishment. The facts of the EU’s “elite” meeting with the judges of the TSUE are known, which has been shocked by French journalists. And was it different in Poland, during the time of the TK President Rzepliński, when the judges of the Court met with the PO activists? It is now that the opposition is pushing the TK, supporting the reports of the Eastern hackers, who seam, quite likely, spread information, and the Great Brother from the east tightenes his hands, that he has found another “beneficial idiots” who seam confusion among the Poles.
25114	9	Does this doctrine that TSUE guides not remind us of something? Is this not a so-called place? “Neumann’s doctrine,” which says that the Polish “free courts” do not move “their”, that is, the members and sympathians of the PO, as long as they are “their”? The last “success” of the TSUE, is his yesterday judgment that the EU countries are obliged to accept illegal immigrants who for various reasons are unable to formally seek asylum. What does it mean? This means, among other things, that according to the TSUE, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have the obligation to take over the illegal migrants sent to us, brought to this role by the Eastern dictators. That would not even the “Russian troll” invent that he could demand the legalization of his actions. Of course, no reasonable state is to agree with this judgment, just as the individual states have not agreed with the many judgments of that lawful instance, which stands above all law. Interestingly, only for Poland, which has not the most unfulfilled sentences on its account, this court imposes large financial penalties, which, I hope, our country will never pay. Because this Poland, so “non-Turkish”, is the EU not fit?
25114	11	“Dear Donald,” I would like to say at the end, go back to Brussels, go to another Berlin, burn a cigarette, go into a branch and stop taking care of politics, because, as your achievements in this field show, no one is satisfied with your business.
25114	13	The PS. Everyone who will accuse me of manipulations I refer to yesterday's TVP news from 19:30, you can easily find them, look at this fragment, which starts from the 16th minute.
25115	1	The shock! President Duda: “Please clean your teeth a bit”
25115	3	President Duda met on Tuesday with the inhabitants of the district of July (war. The Mazowic. He also addressed the issue of high inflation: “Unfortunately, not only Polish matters decide how our lives look, but also those external matters have an impact on it (...). Please be calm because we do everything we can to minimize the inflation pressure. I ask you to be a good state of thought; to make your teeth a bit tight and to be optimistic. No one expected it to come to us. We have not caused war in Ukraine, we have not caused a pandemic. The prices are rising and we have no influence on it. We have to stop it somehow.”
25115	5	This is the “inflation pressure” of the government for years. Unfortunately, the PiS government focuses on helping in its style, i.e. through the distribution of money. This is the least efficient and costly solution. It is known that in order for the government to give someone 2 zlotys, it must take someone else 3 zlotys, because it comes to the cost of transfer andining appropriate officials. In addition, one-time or short-term financial aid is not the same as systematic aid, and it is very burdened by the state budget and causes inflation. The programmes of 500 plus, 300 plus, 13 and 14 retirement, anti-inflation targets, covid supplements for doctors, and now 300 plus for Ukrainians and 1200 plus owes the Polish state a lot, and their effect is primarily populistic.
25115	7	Such a program 1200 plus causes many doubts. First, the Poles very pleased to open the doors of their homes and houses to the Ukrainians, without expecting anything in return. Now the government is interfering in this, calling for apparent help to those who want to earn – thus activating the covanians. It is a sign to the West because the Poles are helping because they get the money. In addition, 300 plus for a million Ukrainians is 300 million zlotys, and 1200 plus is already 1 billion 200 million. It is likely that the program will be extended. It is estimated that up to 5 million refugees can come to our country, and then these costs will be huge. The EU has threatened us, announcing that it will allocate 500 million zlotys to help refugees, which will also be distributed between all host countries. The Polish government, however, estimates that this aid may amount to up to 10 billion zlotys, and thus half of what costs us 500 plus.
25115	9	You need to help, but you need to do it with your head. 300 PLN at a time is an emergency aid that is not enough for a lot, but if it is received by 5 million people it becomes a huge amount of 1.5 billion PLN. In a situation where we are indefinitely in debt, this kind of expenditure only takes us the budget. It seems that the Polish government is gladly debt to power, as the gambler who won felt rich and spent the money he did not earn. The fact is that the Polish government has not won any money, and it is already spending the money not even our own, but our children. It is worth remembering it and asking for some moderation.
25115	11	This kind of distribution of money creates inflation. The concept of “putininflation” is a manipulation, because the war in Ukraine has only deepened certain processes. Similarly, the president is right when he says we had no influence on the appearance of the coronavirus, but he does not add that we had already a decisive, rather ruling influence on the introduction of lockdown that caused a giant inflation. Calling to clut the teeth in this context is an impurity similar to a situation in which we would first lower someone’s wages, and then call him to save. The problem is that milk has broken down and the government will be difficult to stop the tsunami that it has caused itself. Unfortunately, radical actions, such as the rise of interest rates, are needed, and it suffers everyone, especially the poorest. At least the president should not say that it is not the fault of the rulers. This is not true.
25121	1	Success of the Ukrainian army. They destroyed the Russian ammunition warehouse. Summary of Night
25121	3	"The Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed the command and observation position of the 785. separated division of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, two ammunition warehouses and the anti-tank missile complex ""Fagot"", the operating command ""South"" said. According to Prime Minister Irina Vereszczuk, there are approximately 800,000 people. Internal residents will need housing. See what happened in the night!"
25121	5	Nearly 800 thousand. Ukrainian citizens lost their homes
25121	7	Around 800 thousand. Individual persons will need housing and are doing everything to provide them with a place to live and spend the winter, the Vice-President and Minister said on Sunday. the reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories of Irina Vereszczuk.
25121	9	In terms of temporary housing, almost 800,000. Ukrainian people lost their homes. The Government has prepared modular construction programmes supported by the Ministry of Regions, which has the appropriate measures for their implementation. As you know, these are common programs with the Polish government, other governments are also involved in them, the first modular cities have already been formed, but that’s definitely too little,” Irina Wereszczuk said.
25121	11	"She noticed she was a witness to the situation in the district of Blackhaw, where people really didn’t want to live in modular cities because they previously lived in their own, private buildings. They said, we want ""at least one room, but in our garden."" But it’s not yet possible to ensure that it’s happening,” she said."
25121	13	Slovenia: There will be no heating season in the city
25121	15	Slovenian Sea Wadym Lach said on Sunday that it will not be possible to start the war in the city with the arrival of the cooling season.
25121	17	“Today there is no water or gas in Slovenia, and the electricity is delivered with interruptions due to the proximity of the high voltage line to the war zone,” Wadym Lach said in an interview with Donbas News. He added that under such conditions, it will not be possible to start the heating season with the arrival of colds.
25121	19	He said the people of Slovenia should be evacuated because the attempts to conquer the city by the Russian army will continue.
25121	21	The armed forces destroyed the Russian ammunition warehouse and the observatory.
25121	23	"The Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed the command and observation position of the 785. separated division of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, two ammunition warehouses and the anti-tank missile complex ""Fagot"", the Ukrainian Truth said on Monday on the basis of a message of the operational command ""South""."
25121	25	"According to a Monday message of the ""South"" command, 66 Russians, five tanks, two self-driving caves, three armored vehicles and nine cars were destroyed."
25121	27	The armed forces also destroyed the Merlin-VR drone near Ivanovka, where the Russians tried to carry out an air intelligence.
25121	29	"The Ukrainian air force made five attacks on the enemy's positions. In particular, three enemy positions were attacked in the Berysławski powt. A pair of Mi-8 and Mi-24 fighters destroyed 2 enemy positions in the Chersonia region, OK ""South"" reports."
25127	1	The Ordo Iuris
25127	3	The greatest of the 20s. The 21st century is a hybrid war. The hybrid war against Poland is led by Putin, Lukaszenko, but also Brussels. We hear about the hybrid war almost every day, the fashion of the hybrid war dominated our politics. And I wanted to remember old school terrorism.
25127	5	According to the European Commission, terrorism is “all intentional acts committed by individuals or organizations against States, their institutions or the population in order to threaten”. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adds that it is an action motivated by “extremist ideological concepts, fanaticism or irrational and subjective factors, aimed at creating a climate of terror among individuals, certain individuals or groups in society or throughout society.”
25127	7	In accordance with these definitions, I propose to include the Pro Foundation – Right to Life and the Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture, as well as Kai Godek on the EU list of persons, groups and entities who are subject to sanctions in connection with their participation in terrorist acts. This is for the beginning, although there should be a place on the list for several other “life defenders.” The action of which is undoubtedly aimed at “tracking,” as well as “creating a climate of terror” among the “defined group” – doctors, especially related to gynecology and positioning, but not only – and is undoubtedly motivated by “extremist ideological concepts, fanatism, and irrational subjective factors.” And even though this condition is no longer defined, it causes the death of innocent people.
25127	9	For order: no one who is not the spiritual brother of Kai Godek, has no doubt about the fact that the loud death of a pregnant woman in a hospital in Pszczina is the direct result of the judgment of the Prilbsk court on the prohibition of “eugenic abortion”. There is no field to interpret here: the fetus had inherited defects, in addition it came to the pet – that is, it was damaged – before it could be removed, now no more; if it was removed in time, the woman would most likely live. So she died. So many.
25127	11	But in the context of terrorism, the second aspect is more important – the cessation of pregnancy to save the health and life of a woman. Theoretically it is acceptable. According to the Federation for Women and Family Planning, three hundred legal abortions have been made in Poland after the announcement of the judgment of the Prilubsky Tribunal, namely abortions for the salvation of life and mother’s health. It is 15 times more than before. What means that there are brave doctors in Poland presenting the good of patients over their comfort and safety. Nevertheless, as the opponents are repeating to strengthen the anti-abortion law, the state has no right to demand heroism from its citizens. Neither from women who are forced to a terrible sacrifice for the fetus, nor from doctors who, deciding to stop pregnancy, risk today their professional future, and their freedom. We are entering the area of fear.
25127	13	As Prof. Marzena Dębska, a gynecologist, correctly notes, it is never known who will be the author of the expertise in the possible disciplinary or criminal case related to abortion to save a woman's life. And the medicine is different from mathematics, that the same numbers, for example. The indicator of inflammation CPR – can be differently interpreted. As already seriously life-threatening – i.e. legitimate treatment by removing the fetus – or not at all. No one will doubt that if the Zyobra Prosecutor's Office decided to make a demonstration process of a doctor accused of unlawful termination of pregnancy, it will find experts in the style of Professor Chazan, famous for forcing women to give birth to children without heads. Prof. Mariusz Zimmer, Chairman of the Polish Society of Gynecologists and Placeders, notes that among the graduates of medicine there is no desire for this field there is a very lucrative specialization. Too high risk. Doctors are scared.
25127	15	The line of the attack of the integrists against cases such as the Swine can be seen precisely in the statement of the lawyer Magdalena Majkowska from Ordo Iuris, who knowing the matter only from the media, did not hesitate to go to television and announce that the drama is the effect of an error in the medical art. Because “the doctors are not afraid to break pregnancy to save their mother’s life and health,” so if someone doesn’t break when needed, it’s his fault. Let him be afraid.
25127	17	It’s hard to find an act of intimidation more spectacular than the Pro Foundation – The Right to Life, and the Ordo Iuris civil initiative hiding under the enigmatic name “on the change of the Criminal Code and some other laws.” It is this famous project that denies the abortion law and balances abortion with murder. The project’s reporting is Mariusz Dzierżawski, and his deputy Lukas Jończyk – and for them it should also be a place on the terrorist list, because the reporting of such a project is undoubtedly aimed at creating a climate of terrorism.
25128	1	Compare, but how much?
25128	3	Among the many transparents present at the antypistic protests in the eyes was one – with the short slogan: “Exclude!” However, this issue is more complicated than it may seem – and requires clarification. Getting out, but who? Kaczynski himself? The whole dog? With or without youth? And Solidary Poland, Canapa Gowina and Confederation can remain?
25128	5	Another, even more difficult issue, is where to go. Mass emigration, especially during the COVIDU period, seems difficult to accomplish. According to partial data, PiS currently accounts for more than 40,000 people – only during the previous term this number increased by half. Where do we send those people? And who would want them?
25128	7	It’s easy to scream “Forgive!” but what then, no one is thinking about it anymore. To see if this beautiful political password has a translation into practice, I decided to analyze exports from Poland by only one person: President PiS. He is pleased at the right with such authority that if he goes out alone, the rest will undoubtedly follow him.
25128	10	1. Russia
25128	12	I read all the biographies available on the market of the Vice-President and a sad picture emerges from them. Jaroslav was privately abroad only once – as a 18-year-old on the Black Sea in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, he was not satisfied with this trip. In an interview “About two such... the Alphabet of the Kaczynski Brothers” Kaczynski reminds of the burning holidays: “Supply at a catastrophic level. They still eaten bread with trots a few years earlier... After returning to Poland, we had the impression that we were back to the zone of freedom and wealth.”
25128	14	A little time has passed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Russia has become a valued home of peaceful old age for the falling watches. The pension is spent there. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych has been sentenced to 13 years in prison.
25128	16	Putin-Kazhinsky relations are not among the best. In the years 2006-2007, when Jarosław was the prime minister, the gentlemen did not meet once. In 2010, Putin, as it is known, killed Kaczynski's brother who went to Russia with a guest visit. This is not the best place to live together. Although it is worth adding that above the upper Volga is already the city of Jaroslavl, which has more than 600 thousand inhabitants, so named in honor of another wise Jaroslavl – the prince Jaroslavl the wise.
25128	18	Kaczynski’s nature is beyond that he would immediately begin to make Putin around a pear, and although it’s a great country, one dictator quietly for years is enough for him. Even if Kaczynski succeeded in provoking another revolution in Russia, which has already helped Poland to restore its independence, it does not seem realistic that this mentally close to the Bolshevik man would be able to sit on a horse and reach the border.
25128	20	Another, not less important barrier is the language. The president is not “panimayet, you are guards.” If we add to this fact that the writer's elite could feel some historically justified anxiety before traveling into the depths of this strongly forested country, it becomes clear that Jaroslav to Russia may go not to emigration, but above all to tea.
25128	24	2. England
25128	26	The most popular among the Poles is the immigration goal. Kaczynski would even match in that regard that he could try to form there another government in history and through it to issue decrees, deliver orders and pretend to exercise real power. However, the president was already on Tamisa and – gently speaking – he didn’t like it. In November 1989, the Parliamentary Civil Club authorities ordered him to go to London to mobilize English politicians and the local Poland on the recognition of the Polish-German border. In the book “The Agreement Against Monowlads” the president reminds: “I had trouble checking my passports at the airport. Despite my diplomatic passport, I was asked what I wanted to do and where to live. I went to answer something (...). I have returned to Poland with some relief.”
25128	28	A year later, Kaczynski made another flight to England, but this time he did not even leave the airport. He immediately went to Warsaw with a return plane with Ryszard Kaczorovsky, who decided to return the insignia of the head of the State of the Republic of Warsaw.
25128	30	The next visit to the Queen country had to be waited for 20 years. In June 2010, as PiS's presidential candidate, Kaczynski made a visit to Prime Minister David Cameron. The cameras captured the kind welcome of the British and the reaction of Kaczynski: the words “aj dont anderstend”, combined with panic maching hands and searching for a translator.
25128	32	On March 22, 2017, Kaczynski visited London for the last time to meet with Prime Minister Theresa May and discuss Brexit. The terrorist attack on the Westminster Bridge has been forced for a night in London. This is not the memory to which he wants to return.
25128	34	Among the advantages of staying in England, Kaczynski could undoubtedly mention that the country has ceased to belong to the European Union, imposing Poland its opinion on the issue of the rule of law or human rights. In addition, Kaczynski, which is by two of the English did not give in high school from class to class, he could in the islands encounter a number of Poles and open his mouth in the only known speech. However, there is a risk that there may be people who are unpleasant to the president – even labor activists who protested numerous times last week in front of the embassy in London. At least after the murder.
2514	1	Can COVID vaccines be mandatory? Legal Opinion HFPC
2514	3	The Council of Ministers has proposed a draft law to introduce mandatory vaccines against COVID-19. “The current epidemic situation may justify the extension of the obligation for protective vaccines to vaccines against COVID-19. Such a step would be important to protect the health of people who cannot get vaccinated, as well as to ensure effective access to health care for people suffering from other diseases than COVID-19,” HFPC said in its legal opinion.
2514	5	Obligation of authorities
2514	7	In its opinion, HFPC noted that the Constitution imposes on public authorities a duty to combat infectious diseases, although it does not specify in detail how it should be implemented.
2514	9	The way to fulfill this commitment may be mandatory vaccinations against specific epidemic diseases and the authorities have been using this solution for at least a few years. In its opinion, HFPC reminds that in Poland the vaccine order applies to up to 14 diseases and as far the constitutionality of such obligations has not been challenged. What is important, the current law allows for the obligation of protective vaccines against the coronavirus as well. The adoption of a separate law on this subject would enable any doubts about the legality of such an obligation, ensuring that it is better enforced.
2514	11	Vaccination and Personal Freedom
2514	13	The prohibition of vaccination interferes with the individual’s personal freedom and the right to respect the private life. However, these rights are not absolute. Under certain conditions and under certain conditions they may be limited.
2514	15	In this regard, the Constitution requires that such restrictions be established only in the law and only when they are necessary in a democratic state for the protection of certain values. These include the health, rights and freedoms of others, as well as the public order.
2514	17	Court in Strasbourg: Compulsory vaccines do not violate rights
2514	19	The obligation to vaccinate was also the subject of the European Court of Human Rights judgment. In the case of Vavřička and other P. Czechs, he considered mandatory vaccines in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. At the same time, it determined a number of circumstances that should be taken into account when assessing whether vaccinations against a specific disease should become mandatory.
2514	21	It is worth emphasizing that the Polish government also made its opinion on this matter, in which it noted that the obligation to vaccinate as such does not violate the rights and freedoms stipulated in the Convention.
2514	23	The epidemic situation requires action
2514	25	In light of the criteria stipulated by the ETPC, it should be deemed that the current epidemic situation may justify the extension of the obligation for protective vaccines to vaccines against COVID-19. Another alternative solution to combat the pandemic could be the introduction of further restrictions on the freedom of movement, the right to learning, the freedom of business. It would be highly controversial to say that such measures would be less tolerant than the obligation to be vaccinated,” HFPC said in its opinion.
25140	1	Armed meat in the back
25140	3	The Red Army is clearly green. in the fight. Soldiers fight without conviction and kill only by habit. The maneuver of the Russian band reminds in this war scenes from a comedy about the military paths. And the Cigans will take their tanks, and they will shoot their own positions, and the tanks stand because the fuel is missing, and the soldiers give up because the supply is missing and they have not eaten for three days. The myth of the great Russian army fell like Napoleon under Waterloo.
25140	5	The only success of the Russian army was recorded in the shooting of residential blocks and the killing of civilians. In civilians it is easy to reach because there is a lot of them, and scrupulous, like the ethical values of the army does not have. Ukraine was expected to be busy in three days, while three weeks pass and the successes are the same as the Polish athletes at the Chinese Olympics. There will be no medal for this warrior.
25140	7	Unfortunately, Putin does not count completely on losses and will send other soldiers to a certain death. The man in the Russian war tactics is nothing. “We have a lot of people,” Stalin said. During World War II, the so-called Recognition of fighting. To the fortified German positions moved troops, which had Hitler's front, and the NKWD plutons behind. These troops were sent to some scenes, but it was about the discovery of German fire stations, which were later bombed.
25140	9	Putin is called. The second Czech war began with provocation. In 1999, in Moscow, Riazani and Volgodensk, special services launched housing blocks into the air. This happened at night and in the morning. Hundreds of sleeping people were killed. The attacks were accused by the Chechnya separatists and that was the time Putin said famous words that we’d bear them and even drown in a cave, which liked the people who wanted revenge. Today it is known that behind the attacks stood Putin's services, and the throwing into the air of houses was a provocation to justify the resurrection in Chechnya.
25140	11	Even in this war Putin does not regret neither Russians nor Ukrainians. He only regrets that he has not yet won Kiev and that he cannot announce himself as quickly as he wants.
25141	1	Silence of Agatha
25141	3	It’s louder than shooting. It is speaking and calls in the ears like three wake up at the same time.
25141	5	There were black protests. She silenced. When there were women's protests with wheels. She silenced. Police shoot women during the strike. She silenced. Nurses and nurses of persons with disabilities protested. She silenced.
25141	7	When the police brought a 15-year-old woman to the commissioners, for the volcanous screams at the demonstrations. She silenced. When the children of Michael were expelled to the basin and to the forest. She silenced.
25141	9	I watched a movie reading a fairy tale to children in the royal castle in Warsaw. It fits her. Andrzej also tells a story. Not just in the castle, but all the time. But may Agata have to read something about women’s rights?
25141	11	Now that, as a result of the activities of the religious fanatics lobby and the decision of the Supreme Court of Cooking, provisions on the total prohibition of abortion, even in the case of rape or life threat, a young girl from Pszczyna dies, also silent.
25141	13	He could make a small gesture. He is from a good Krakow family. The family of sensitive poets. When on the day of the premiere of the propaganda film Smolensk, went to another film, it was received almost as a demonstration of independence. She has never been and will never be.
25141	15	Strong clothes and elegance, do not cover the lack of class and heart. It’s cool and predictable as a German grammatics exercise.
25141	17	He was in the life of a century. The incident made the husband, a man without a spine, with a gymnasial mentality and appearance of Jasia Fasoli, become the president, and she First Lady.
25141	19	It will not be a fool when a woman from a small town far from Warsaw, a woman she does not know, dies at the result of the hard law. It will not hurt the comfort of life in the presidential palace when some women suffer, fight for their own and are beat.
25141	21	There is a second term. No one will take Andrew out of the fox. And the second time on the seat in the palace cannot start. He could even be compassionate.
25141	23	"There is such a saying that on the ""Lord"" it needs to have money and appearance. First, you just need to have a heart. It seems to be missing."
25143	1	Problems with arrival, the Circle of Mr. President
25143	3	Anyone who once had a new car knows that for the first few thousand kilometers it is not permissible to swim the car and press the gas pedal. The new car has to arrive.
25143	5	Jarosław Kaczyński is not a freshman in politics, but rather a sharply already overwhelmed trouble. However, there are problems with arrival.
25143	7	With the arrival to Jaroslav, the Poles have trouble, which is difficult to enter to his open meetings. The gas pedal in this matter is sharply pushed by the police, which will overlook all citizens who want to tell the President what they think about it.
25143	9	Recently in Kórnik, at the meeting with the local community, only previously marked persons brought by buses were allowed, while the locals were blocked by strengthened police forces.
25143	11	Arriving to Jaroslaw was like sprinkling a conditional castle. Radio and tooth-wrapped policemen protecting the nation's savior is a view to which everyone has already been able to get used to. A news was the horse police troops, who performed a police rodeo, scared those who wanted to meet Jaroslav.
25143	13	Defense experts say that if the temperature of Mr. President's Circus will increase at the same pace as last, then neither the horse patrol nor the Ulan carrier with the radio vessels will no longer be enough. It will need to strengthen the protection by combat wagons, tanks, and by launching missiles. Military specialists say that in the next meeting of the President, it will be necessary to build roofs and stretch the roofs with a coal wire. Refugee mines can also be used.
25143	15	A large amount of equipment in connection with the war in Ukraine has been recently purchased, so there will be no problem with this. The only question is, is it not cheaper to do meetings with the local community in the offices in Novogrodzka, since still in the role of local actors and statistics are engaged? Every time you send only a TVP team, which is hidden and with the curved wheels filming a few pictures of a given town and such material is predicted to a beautiful relationship with the local visitors of Jarozbawa.
25148	1	Silver for Sunday (for silence is gold)
25148	3	Uncompromised Simon
25148	5	Uncompromised Szymon Hołownia, the leader of Poland2050, has always criticized the United Right governments. He also wrote negative about the Foreign Ministry. Meanwhile, it was revealed that the Dobra Fabryka Foundation founded by him in 2020 received 680 thousand zlotys of grants from the same resort. He probably accepted them with denial, but yet he accepted them. I wonder one thing: why did he get it? Per for the same critical attitude to the Civil Platform and its president candidate?
25148	7	The success of the Polish ship
25148	9	Polish teachers the United Right politicians promised a sensitive increase in wages, while at the beginning of January the pedagogues shut their eyes out of surprise seeing the amounts that influenced their accounts. It turned out that their salaries were a few hundred dollars lower than the December. Minister of Education and Science Przemysław Czarnek one day accused the journalist of lying in connection with questions about lower payments of teachers after the introduction of the Polish Lad. He said, “It is not by the Polish Lad, but by other reasons.” The next day, however, government spokesman Piotr Mueller admitted that there was a lower pay and apologized for “legislative inaccuracies.” Finally, even the prime minister apologized for the errors and promised to correct them with the new regulation. The problem is that, as the lawyers say, the law cannot be amended by regulations. But whoever is concerned with such little things in the repair of this stand-alone work, in our beautiful country law does not mean much unless it is in parallel with justice.
25148	11	Once is not enough!
25148	13	For the first time in the past year, the New Year Circuit was opened. This took place in the humble assistance of local governors from PiS, public television and with the participation of Jaroslav Stawiarski (PiS), the marshal of Lubelsky province.  But once it is not enough! A few days later, the traffic was stopped on the already used road and there was a re-festivation of the entrance. This time with the participation of Deputy Prime Minister Jack Sasin and ministers: the infrastructure of Andrej Adamczyk, the funds and regional policy of Gregor Pudy, the education and science of the Black Industry and the Deputy Minister of Finance Piotr Patkowski. On the second, much more sharp opening, almost 60 people, including the same local governors, were invited as the previous week. I wonder if they had no déjà vu during this second party.
25148	15	Dura lex, sed lex
25148	17	Do you remember how during the women’s strike protests in connection with the strengthened anti-abortion law, some nine-year-old police broke the hand? The girl brought the case to court against the police. After a year of investigation, the case ended with a fatigue. Meanwhile, the suspect of painting anti-government and antiquity passwords on the elevation of the church. The court, on the request of the prosecutor's office, sentenced the court to three months in prison. Polish criminal law, however, is a real jungle, full of secrets and surprises, because in his mind it turned out that writing with spray on the wall is more dangerous for society than violence and body damage.
25154	1	We have 599 new infections. The number of infections decreases
25154	3	The number of coronavirus infections in Poland decreases week by week. On Monday, there were 618 new cases. Today, as follows from the words of Deputy Health Minister Waldemar Kraski, COVID-19 was confirmed at 599. “It is, if we compare week to week, a drop of 2 percent, which is less week to week,” the politician summarized in a TVP interview.
25154	5	Infections per week are less than 2 percent.
25154	7	The Ministry of Health publishes daily data on new infections or deaths related to COVID-19. They are published in the hour. 10.30 On August 8th, the latest data was announced in advance. Information about the infection on Monday morning was provided by the deputy health minister Waldemar Kraska.
25154	9	Today it is 599 cases [COVID-19] that is, if we compare week to week, a 2% decline, that is less week to week. These are small numbers, because these are the numbers of the weekend, but if we look at the statistics and the surroundings of our country, that is, the countries of Western Europe, but also the Czech Republic, we see a decline wave everywhere, that is, this summer wave of coronavirus is already definitely weaker,” Waldemar Kraska told TVP.
25154	11	Epidemic situation in Poland — data from 7 August
25154	13	On August 7, 2022, the Ministry of Health 698 new coronavirus infections. Most cases were recorded in the war. Masovich (105), Silesian (78) and Malopolitan (61). He healed seven people infected with COVID-19. No one of the dead was on that day.
25162	1	Chinese military continues exercises around Taiwan
25162	3	The Chinese military will continue on Monday exercises in the sea and in the air space around Taiwan, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (ALW) Command of the Eastern Theatre said on social media.
25162	5	"The army will conduct ""practical exercises in the sea and air spaces"". Chinese soldiers will be trained. The attack on the submarines was in a statement on the Weibo platform."
25162	7	China has launched unprecedented military exercises on the waters and airspaces around Taiwan. Part of the maneuver takes place just 20 km from the Taiwan coast. The guidelines are a response to the recent visit of U.S. House President Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, against which Beijing has strongly protested. It was initially announced that the exercises will end on Sunday.
25167	1	The great Rafa Koralova is great not only by name. It has just come to climate change.
25167	3	Is it possible today to write something optimistic and positive by moving the theme of climate change and the coral raft? Contrary to intuition, it seems that. This is really surprisingly good news.
25167	5	"According to researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences, the Great Raffa Coral is currently the largest in almost 40 years. Such a ""regeneration"" that covers up to 2/3 of the surface of the Great Coral Rave probably no one expected."
25167	7	It is widely known that climate change, the continuous heating of the ocean waters expose sensitive to temperature and sunrise of the coral to truly difficult conditions of development. Increasing heat waves, and thus increasing sea temperatures, cause the so-called heat waves every year. the blinking of the coral raft, which leads to the gradual demolition of this fascinating ecosystem.
25167	9	Rafael Coral is slowly rebuilding.
25167	11	The more surprising is described by the scientists in the report the process occurring in the northern and central regions of the Great Coral Rave. The coral seems to have decided to fight for survival. Such an intense reconstruction process has not been seen by the oceanographers for decades.
25167	13	Considering that as the atmospheric warming process progresses at an increasing pace, it is pleased that the blinking of the coral raft in 2020 and 2022 is no longer as intense as 5-6 years ago. This, in turn, means that the corals are more and more able to tolerate the conditions in the ocean and are able to rebuild.
25167	15	Of course, here we are talking about a big step in the right direction, but to complete success still definitely far away. Researchers indicate that in the central part of the Great Coral Reef, the living coral levels reached 33 percent, and in the northern region, 36 percent. It may seem little, but it’s already a rise that returns the hope that the coral can regenerate and return to life. If this trend remained in the next few years, and the episodes of raffle blinking would become slightly rare, the magnificent coral raffle, which is one of the most unique marine ecosystems on Earth, could return to full glory and protect from the extinction of thousands of species that rely on it.
25171	1	News in TVP! How Tusk and the Germans “invented mercury”
25171	3	One thing we can be sure: as long as PiS runs, nothing can be explained in a definitive and reliable way. We will hear a story that will cause the least damage to the authority.
25171	5	TVP’s “News” main editions on Monday and Tuesday (15–16 August) had a clear message about the environmental disaster in Odra: the situation is under control, and “total opposition” inspired by the German lies about river mercury. Tuska’s metaphors about “the shattered state of the PiS” and “the PiS which is like a mercury” are empty insult to the authority, to which nothing can be denied about Odra.
25171	7	The “News” of 15 August was a pathetic and religious circumstantial program (Day of the Polish Army), in which it was possible, among others. To learn from Danuta Holecka that Mother of God twice appeared to Russian soldiers, defending them from entering Warsaw. This vision caused flooding in the Bolsheviks. In addition, on the occasion of the Christmas concert in Elblug, the crossroads of Mierzei Wiślanej were praised under the sky – not only as an investment in Poland’s independence, but also a great economic enterprise. No doubt – even in this second issue – the public television journalists have no.
25171	9	The TVP. This exaltation, this turmoil, this duma
25171	11	It is very difficult to find in this characteristic infantile-military aesthetics and rhetoric someone who has not been raised on the Russian-Asian patterns of public life. The old Poles remember this with PRL and probably some will like it. You know youth. And those who don’t remember the PRL can combine the style of Jack Kursky’s television with China or other Eastern countries. Something of this comes to us through movies and movies. That exaltation, that turmoil, that duma... Only do we really have to do ourselves in Asia? Does Jacek Kurski, producing his “News” for President Kaczynski, see in him the little Xi Jinping? His way, interesting trop: the Asian characteristics of Jaroslav Kaczynski. I throw the ball, let the sinologists catch.
25171	13	In any case, the psychological profile of the President of Poland in the eyes of the President of the TVP will remain a mystery of the latter, although Mr. Kursky must be admired for the professionalism in the field of propaganda and the enormous devotion of the work of staying on the table, from which a few other gentlemen would be willing to scratch him.
25171	15	But let’s go back to the road. On Tuesday, August 16th, the broadcast was much greater. There is a lot of information that we know from other media. How many samples of water were taken, what could have happened (as it is known, not yet known), how many dead fish were caught. First of all, it was informed (it seems that according to the truth) that the situation is improving.
25171	17	It was also mentioned about the drainage of Odra, for what (as Prime Minister Morawiecki assured on Tuesday) the means will be found. In general, as it follows from the “News” material, nothing so great has happened, and the cause of the disaster – although unknown to the end – is related to the low water state, which causes a variety of ecological problems not only in us. I add here to myself that in the slowly published journalistic materials about the river catastrophe very little is said about how this state of water actually formed. It wasn’t so low again. There is also almost no talk about retention tanks and slices, and therefore whether the possibilities of dispersing Odra water have been used. This topic is likely to come back.
25171	19	Tusk compares Pis to Mercury
25171	21	"We’re going to see Tuesday’s news. Immediately after the material on Odrze,ined in a fairly material tone, a real explosion of the height occurred on Donald Tusk. Here the “total opposition” uses the misfortune, such as an ecological catastrophe, to a dirty political war, which is hand in hand with the Germans. The weapon in this war was disinformation about the alleged presence of mercury in Odra, which is not confirmed. The country is a ""lavin of lies"" and it has it in blood. It is enough to remind that Prime Minister Kopacz said there was no money for any 500 plus, and at the same time Tusk promised that he would introduce a similar program. As you can see, he is a router. He had a retirement age and now wants a four-day working day."
25171	23	Indeed, I can no longer follow a four-day working day, but as to PiS as a snown fish and comparing it to mercury, it doesn’t seem to be somewhat very explosive epites – and it doesn’t matter how many mercury compounds are eventually discovered or not discovered. The insistence that the PO together with the Germans “invented the mercury” is absurd. The news of the mercury appeared in the German media, and at the same time he heard about it by the marshalkin of the Lubus province Elizabeth Polak from the environment minister of Brandenburg Alexa Vogla. Per some mercury bond has been detected somewhere, but this has not been confirmed in the next samples. Tusk used the PiS comparison with mercury when the “mercury hypothesis” was still on time. The hypothesis has already passed into history, but the metaphor has not lost its actuality – and that’s for a lot of reasons.
25171	25	The opposition does not accuse the authorities that they have allowed that one or another chemical substance was found in Odra (maybe it will be time for such accusations), but that it has not responded in time. And that’s the key thing. That’s what the game is going on and that’s what the government’s PR strategy focuses on. This is shown by the press conference of the dygnitarists, which took place on Tuesday, August 16. After a very professional and full detailed transmission of the Ministers of the Environment and Infrastructure, journalists began to ask about the date of the intervention by the central institutions. The questions remained unanswered, and the chairman of the conference unceremonially “extended” them. It was apparent that the issue of delay was reserved for the “gory” itself (because the prime minister talked about it, with the demission of two high officials), and the ministers of Moscow and Adamchik had to not speak in this great affair.
25171	27	The dog goes ahead.
25171	29	Rejection is a fatal strategy. But literally from hour to hour there was a major change in it. Here at the conference of the Dolnoślský wojewoda Jarosław Obrębski (PiS) and his supporters presented numerous details regarding the chronology of events. The explanation of a few days of delay in decisive actions in the Lower Silesia, provided by local governors from PiS, was that after the first signals of numerous drowned fish, the situation improved, and only after a few days its radical deterioration. Thus, the responses of the authorities were proportionate and corresponded to the development of the situation. This is the story of a new narrative. Of course, there were delays, but justified by the dynamics of the course of the disaster.
25171	31	Therefore, we can talk more about lack of transparency than about negligence. At the same time, PiS is “going forward,” because as the “News” praised, the government now wants to create the most modern system in Europe for early warning of water pollution. It really has as much reliability as electric cars and Morawiecki trains, but it can help to calm the electorate. In the drama “Ecological Disaster of the Odra River” much more can happen. It can also happen little and in two weeks the topic will disappear, replaced by a completely new. Today, it is difficult to assess the probability of both of these scenarios. One thing we can be sure: as long as the PiS runs, nothing can be explained in a definitive and reliable way. We will hear a story that will cause the least damage to the authority.
25173	1	Lost in translation. The propaganda reverses the attention of the government’s failure. Odry
25173	3	"The government media and politicians of PiS recognized the German minister's speech as evidence of the ""fake"" of the marshalkin Elizabeth Polak about the presence of mercury in Odra. Propaganda throughout Monday turned away attention from Polish government's urgent reaction to the river pollution"
25173	5	At the end of the day on Monday it was revealed that German measurements actually showed mercury in the water, but it was not taken from the main coast of the river and it is already known that it is not responsible for the death of fish. Still, three weeks after the first signs of the Odra disaster, it is unknown what kills the river.
25173	7	However, August 15 was a day of mercury and Prime Minister Morawiecki was able to reject Donald Tusk on a press conference on Odra with accusations of fake news.
25173	9	Lost in translation
25173	11	The information that Odra could kill the salt of mercury appeared at the end of the week. It was repeated by the PO activists, referring to the first German analysis.
25173	13	Marseille Elizabeth Polak posted on Twitter a photo from a video conference with the German minister and wrote that he “in a direct conversation” acknowledged that “the concentration of mercury in Odra was so high that it was impossible to determine the scale.” It confirmed the reports of the German radio and television RBB, which was the first to publish information about mercury in the river.
25173	15	The good affair with mercury broke out on Sunday, because government propaganda made it the main problem of Odra and convinced that it was a false information disguised by the opposition. It began after a joint Polish-German consultation and a press conference. The situation in Odrze on Sunday, August 14, 2022. This should be the beginning of a new, better cooperation between the two countries to identify the causes of the environmental disaster. Instead, we are facing a diplomatic scandal.
25173	17	The TVP journalist asked the German delegation if it was actually found a mercury in the river samples, Polak reports.
25173	19	“Marshalek of Lubusky County wrote on Twitter on Friday that you personally confirmed that the concentration of mercury in Odra was so high that the scale could not be determined. I wanted to ask you if you said such words, on what basis and why,” the question sounded. But, as we wrote in OKO.press, a Polish translator who sent the question to the Minister of Agriculture and Environment of the German land of Brandenburg to Axel Vogl asked him, however, if he said to the marshalkin Polak that Odra is “growing.” The matter of mercury is missed.
25173	21	Vogel replied, “this statement is not known to him.” “We informed that the pH ratio is very high and we can’t explain why this happened,” he added.
25173	23	But although the question was wrongly translated, the Polish pro-government media found that the minister denied it. And they began their pursuit of Elizabeth Polak.
25173	25	Strong words to the quotes were provided on Twitter by the politicians of PiS.
25173	27	“After this statement of the German minister, there is a reasonable suspicion that Elizabeth Polak in a crisis has disinformed the public opinion. situation in the way. I think it should be clarified by the relevant services,” said Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration Pavel Szefernaker on Sunday evening.
25173	29	“This is a great affair. Or did the Marseille of Lubusky invent a mercury? Per to distract the attention from the problems underlying her WORD?” – said Maciej Wąsik, also Vice-President of the MSWiA.
25173	31	“The case is obvious. The official position of Germany is well-known,” said deputy climate and environment minister Jacek Ozdoba.
25173	33	The Martial War. Lulu’s “dezinformed public opinion” This is the question that was still on Monday afternoon on the main website of TVP.info. Similar titles appeared on the websites inPolityce.pl and the Polish Times.
25173	35	The Germans surprised
25173	37	“This is annoying! I was asked by a translator about a presumed quote from my person that water in Odra could burn my hands. I answered it and explained the pH value. I was not asked about the level of mercury,” Vogel wrote on Twitter this morning.
25173	39	He added to the post the screenshots shared by one of the Twitter reporters showing how the pro-government Polish media use Vogla's speech to dement the alleged fake news of the Polak marshmallow.
25173	41	As it turned out, the German minister at the conference did not hear any questions about mercury at all, so he could not denote anything.
25173	43	However, government media managed to redirect attention to this particular “success” of power — the lack of mercury in the river. Thousands of dead fish, Odra’s pollution and the government’s harshness in response to the ecological disaster have gone to a further plan.
25173	45	It was a mercury, but it is not that it kills.
25173	47	We don’t know what killed thousands of fish. Polish and German studies for now indicate high water intake, increased — basic — pH and increased oxygen concentrations.
25173	49	From an email from the Brandenburg Ministry of the Environment to OKO.press, it is stated that the level of mercury is still being checked. In this context, the Saturday message of the Minister of Climate Anna Moscow, in which it assures that the Germans did not detect the presence of mercury in the water, seemed premature (At a press conference on Sunday the Minister that Poland “works on the identification of the source”).
25173	51	No studies have confirmed the presence of toxic substances. We also conduct fish research. We have completed the study in the direction of mercury and heavy metals – they have not been found in samples. We will check 300 more indicators in the near future,” Moscow said on Sunday.
25173	53	On Monday afternoon, the German authorities summarized the meeting with the Polish side.
25173	55	Minister Axel Vogel confirmed that he warned Elizabeth Polak that a high concentration of mercury was detected in the first sample examined by the Germans. However, he had to add that the sample could be an anomaly and the test should be done again.
25173	57	Other samples were to give results within the limits of environmental tolerance or slightly exceeding it.
25173	59	Vogel said he did not think that the mercury was the cause of the death of fish. Because this element is long accumulated in living organisms.
25173	61	“We’re mistaken in darkness, we’re studying insecticides, pesticides, all kinds of substances,” Vogel said.
25173	63	The German environment minister, Steffi Lemke, said that while the research is ongoing and it is still unknown what poisoned the river, “the river doesn’t seem to be the cause of fish death.” A spokesman for Lemke Urlich Schulte told Polsat News that “the dirt has not been detected in both drowned fish and in the water itself. So today we can exclude it.”
25173	65	On the other hand, the Polish Environmental Protection Head Inspectorate acknowledged that in the German samples, collected in the Old Town of Odra and its flowers, there was mercury. Polish research in the main river river did not show mercury, and the State Veterinary Inspection excluded mercury as the cause of sleeping fish.
25173	67	Sleeping fish in the glywick channel
25173	69	The Min. Vogel also emphasized that information about the pollution of Odra at the height of Wroclaw the German side should have received from Poland on July 28. “But that did not happen. We were surprised,” he regretted.
25173	71	The first sleeping fish in Brandenburg was observed on August 9. We had no warning from Poland,” Schulte said. And it was two weeks after the information about Odra contamination appeared in Poland. Previously, fishermen dead fish in the Gliwick Canal.
25176	1	Eco-Death Writing
25176	3	They are closed about Odyssey. The opposition rightly presses on the details. This is a whole lawina question. in the council and in the media. If they responded fairly as they were, there would be a chance for political forces to cooperate. But they didn’t read Bartoshevsky or Kotarbinsky that it is worth being kind, and as you don’t know what to say, you say the truth. They clearly don’t know what to say, and the truth they don’t want to say. So after the old: instead of clarificing, they attack those who want clarifications.
25176	5	In the Internet there is no information emptiness. If they don’t say the truth, the emptiness is filled with speculation. There is information about the person who poisoned. I don’t repeat because it’s not verified. At the commission on Wednesday, however, a key question came: do you want to hide the criminal and the reasons for the reckless silence in the Kaczynski camp? If so, the escapes of the present power would gain coherence: they know, but they have a powerful problem, so they lie and blame, they play back, they are looking for captivating replacement topics.
25176	7	Whatever the final conclusions are – a poison crime or a natural cause, that is, a higher force – the case of Odra also has two points. First, citizens see in what condition under the Kaczynski government the state is funded from their taxes. Secondly, many Poles and Poles will open their eyes to the truth that nature must be careful, because it will not defend itself from the robbery exploitation of its resources under the defence of bad governments.
25176	9	The bad governments draw from “ecologism” as from other so-called “left” ideologies. Therefore, Kaczynski ignored the disaster during the disaster in the Rudy of Slezskaya. He was silent because he knew the truth from the beginning. But also in order not to make the impression on the written concrete that the questions of the opposition generally deserve the answer. It is the opposite: we want to know why the Polish waters serve, why there is no constant monitoring of the rivers, what is the idea of the government to reject Odra and to ensure Poland water safety.
25176	11	The tactics adopted by the Kaczynski camp – a mix of arrogance with manipulation and information regulation – will be a failure. Sooner or later the answers will be known. If it turns out that it was about hiding the truth, voters, even writers, will not forgive the topic.
25176	13	Insisting that asking questions is unpatriotical is a cartoon of the constructive work of the seam. Parliamentarians asking specific questions to the government are patriotic. It is unpatriotic to avoid them when the ecological clock touches more and more loud.
25176	15	Part 2. The Golden Alges
25176	17	Finally they invented: this is the gold algae, not the KGHM with the permission of the Polish waters or some other large state facility. Natural disasters, as in other European rivers. Go away, Tusk.
25176	19	Only these soils, what about them? Where did they get and where did they get the golden algae? It’s not their fault, it’s the “political fault” of the opposition. And the problem is from the head, because the PiS turns down and falls down until his pearls pull something up. When there is a message they consider reliable, the nerves are calming.
25176	21	in advance. There are the first surveys already from the inside of the rectangle. Approximately 70 percent believe that the current government is guilty. In the political survey, Tuska divides from Kaczynski only 2 percent, a statistical error. The decline trend continues. It’s already too late to get to the full truth about the disaster. “The emergency” helped to stop traces and evidence. But the discomfort is not so easy to expect.
2518	2	The Left Convention. Almost in all cases, vaccinations are mandatory.
2518	4	"Instead of fighting the pandemic, the rulers are fighting for power, said on Saturday the leaders of the Lewica, Vladimír Czarzasty and Robert Biedron. They persuaded that in the name ofining the ""crush majority in the Sejm"", the government is listening to people who claim that if someone is vaccinated against Covid-19, it has a chip."
2518	6	"During the Saturday convention, Levica activists and their invited doctors, epidemiologists and persons who lost their loved ones in the pandemic, persuaded the leftist vision of ""Recepts for Poland"", as they called a package of solutions that they believe will effectively help the state, including the municipalities, in the fight against the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and overcoming its effects. They also presented proposals for the development of the health protection system among others. Increasing the capacity of medical staff."
2518	8	Almost in all speeches it was convinced to the introduction of compulsory vaccines against Covid-19, as the co-President of the New Left, European Parliament Robert Biedron summarized, stating that “obligatory vaccines are a guarantee of safety for us all.”
2518	10	According to the Co-President of the New Left Vladimír Czarzasty, people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19, are slightly sick, and if they are sick, the course of this disease is lighter. He referred to statistics that show that vaccinated people die rarely, and 90 percent of hospitalized patients. They are non-vaccinated people. “Is there any conclusion of this?” He asked. “I have an idea – maybe people need to be vaccinated,” he added.
2518	12	The Characters, and previously other members and members of the Lewica, reminded that on December 7th ub. This year, the group submitted a draft law on compulsory but not compulsory vaccines. Czarzasty noted that since that moment in Poland - as he said - more than a million people have been affected by Covid-19 and 20 thousand of them have died.
2518	14	"Czarzasty believed that in the fight against the epidemic, the rulers do not listen to either experts or doctors. “Mr. Prime Minister, you know why the doctors have left you. You don’t want to listen to them. And they advised you, many of them, compulsory vaccines,"" he addressed the head of government Mateus Morawiecki. “You listen to the crazy, people who think the world is flat, you listen to people who think this flat world is on the corpus of the bear. You hear people who say that if someone is vaccinated, he has a chip - Chinese, Russian; that he will behave like a robot, that he will not think that the chip will take the mind out of him,"" he added."
2518	16	"The Deputy Prime Minister of the Sejm accused PiS Prime Minister and President Jaroslav Kaczynski of ""in the name of the Sejm majority, the Sejm majority kills people."" Czarasty also claimed that Morawiecki and Kaczynski only for the maintenance of this majority listen to politicians who “have neither knowledge nor reason, but only bad emotions.” He has several times referred to the deputy of the Parliamentary PiS Club Anna Maria Siarkowskaya from the Republican Party, recognised in his environment as the leader of ""anti-vaccinators"". “You’re creating a situation that the majority of the seams kill people,” Czarzasty said."
2518	18	"On the other hand, Biedron said Moravecki and his cabinet recognized that ""there is nothing to be done, that the pandemic must be anticipated,"" and then called for the Saturday congress of European right-wing and conservative parties in Spain."
2518	20	Today, instead of fighting for the lives and health of the Poles, Prime Minister Morawiecki is meeting with pro-Putin, anti-European leaders and leaders. They are not interested in Poles and Poles. He’s deceived,” he emphasized.
2518	22	"According to the European Parliament, ""in most European countries have long existed such security standards that lack in Poland,"" while the ruling camp in Poland called the party ""No Da Si""."
2518	24	Covid Passport? Prime Minister Moravecki says it’s not possible. Compulsory vaccines - +not possible+, free mass testing - +not possible+, privileges for vaccinated and safety for all of us - +not possible+. Today, with full responsibility, we can say that we are governed by the +No Da Si + party. Morawiecki and Kaczynski, what can be seen today as on their hands, can only dissolve these hands ineffectively, as if hundreds of people die every day, Poles and Poles, nothing meant for them,” Biedron said.
2518	26	"According to him, the only thing that interests the ruling camp today is the preservation of “the cruel majority in the Sejm.” “They do this brutally, through persecution, chantage and obedience,” he said. ""Instead of fighting a pandemic, they are fighting for power,"" the co-chairman of the New Left said."
2518	28	“Lewica wants to say clearly and clearly: we stand on the side of life, we will do everything we can to fight for the health and safety of the Poles and the Poles,” he said.
2518	30	Beedron was convinced that unlike the current power camp, Lewica stood at the height of the task. “We put concrete things on the table, we have concrete proposals regarding mandatory vaccines, privileges for vaccinated, covid passports, public health protection and a jumping rise in wages for medical staff,” he said.
2518	32	At the same time, he called on “to the entire democratic opposition” to unite “for the health and safety of the Poles and the Poles” and to form a “coalition for life”.
2518	34	“I am therefore appealing on behalf of Lewica to the largest opposition party, I am appealing to Donald Tusk, to the Civil Coalition, let us be in one order and together with NGOs, trade unions, with all the people of good will, we are conducting the law proposed by Lewica on mandatory vaccinations. Today your inaction, or your action, can save human lives; it is no longer a political struggle today, it is a struggle for the lives of the people, the Poles and the Poles.” by PAP)
25181	1	Side effects of Novavax vaccine against COVID-19
25181	3	From 1 March 2022, and therefore less than two years after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic, the Poles have the opportunity to vaccinate themselves with a new Novavax vaccine. What is distinguished? How does it work and what are its side effects?
25181	5	COVID-19 vaccines are available from December 2020. Since then, almost 60% of the Polish population has been vaccinated. Since March of this year, Novavax’s fifth Nuvaxovid vaccine is available. The Ministry of Health has announced that it can be vaccinated by people who are over 18 years of age.
25181	7	Novavax vaccine – composition, action, history of occurrence
25181	9	Until now, the coronavirus can be vaccinated with several types of vaccines, which can be divided into 3 groups:
25181	11	Astra Zeneca, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen
25181	13	Traditional protein – Novavax.
25181	15	- mRNA – Modern, Pfizer & BioNTech.
25181	17	Nuvaxovid is a product of the U.S. biotech company Novavax. Curiously, a few years ago, the company was threatened to be removed from the stock market. This was associated with the fact that despite the millions of research expenditure, no Novavax products met with the favourable opinion of the regulatory authorities. The company’s fate was saved by the vaccine COVID-19.
25181	19	Nuvaxovid is included in traditional protein vaccines. Its composition contains an antigen in the form of a purified protein S (cold) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as an adiuwant of plant origin obtained from the appropriate soap. Its effectiveness and safety have been proven by clinical trials conducted on 60,000 participants.
25181	21	How does the Novavax vaccine work? Once the antigen comes into the body, the immune system recognizes it as a stranger and starts the production of antibodies, as well as T lymphocytes. It recognizes foreign proteins and starts a cascade of defense processes.
25181	23	The Novavax vaccine is given in two doses, at a interval not less than 3 weeks.
25181	25	Contraindications to taking Novavax vaccine
25181	27	The contraindications for COVID-19 vaccination with Nuvaxovid include anaphylactic reaction to any of its ingredients. The vaccine can be given to people who have previously received SARS-CoV-2 infection.
25181	29	Side effects of Novavax vaccine
25181	31	The side effects after Novavax vaccine do not differ significantly from complications after other vaccines. Most often it is noted:
25181	33	Pain in the place of infusion,
25181	35	muscle pain,
25181	37	The headache,
25181	39	general weakness of the body,
25181	41	Nausea and vomiting,
25181	43	pain of the joints.
25181	45	Most of the unwanted vaccine reactions (NOPs) have a mild nature and disappear independently.
25186	1	North Korea: Kim Jong-un announces victory of the “socialist regime” over coronavirus
25186	3	North Korean leader Kim Jong-un announced a “win” in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and ordered the abolition of the most sharp preventive measures introduced in May, the official news agency KCNA on Thursday.
25186	5	According to KCNA, Kim said the official number of deaths due to the epidemic, which is 74 people, “is an unprecedented miracle” compared to other countries.
25186	7	The North Korean leader ordered the abolition of the most urgent measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic but said that North Korea must maintain “a strong as steel anti-epidemic barrier and intensify its efforts to combat the epidemic until the end of the global health crisis.”
25186	9	Reuters reminds that North Korea has never the number of confirmed Covid-19 diseases. Since July 29, she said that no new cases were detected, which, according to independent experts, was the result of limited possibilities of testing.
25186	11	There is no information about vaccination in the country. The authorities that the fight against the virus was based on lockdowns, domestic medications and, as Kim said, on “the leader of the Korean socialist system.”
25186	13	As KCNA wrote, Kim’s sister, Kim Jo Jong, revealed that her brother had a high fever. He also accused South Korea of contributing to the epidemic.
25192	1	And when (when) Are we going to grow in Poland?
25192	3	Once upon a time, the cultivation of morella and vineyards in Poland was marginal and difficult. Today it is allowed by weather conditions. Will we, with climate change, cultivate species that are currently “reserved” for the countries of South Europe?
25192	5	Even a few decades ago, marble farming in Poland on a commodity scale did not exist. The establishment of numerous morel plants in the sandomier depth allowed: climate change and the cultivation of varieties suitable for Polish soil and climate conditions. A few years ago the climate in Sandomier was the same as in Hungary in the 1970s.
25192	7	But the climate is changing all the time. We see this also on the basis of the development of the vineyard in Poland, which in the past century did not grow so dynamically. The question remains open, when will the climate conditions in Poland allow the cultivation of arbuzes, kiwi or other species produced today in the south of Europe?
25192	9	We will also meet with more “dark” visions of climate scientists. Some computer simulations show that the southern Europe in a few hundred years will not be suitable for agricultural production at all, and that will slowly move to the north of the continent.
25192	11	The best example of the above thesis is Southern Italy. Calabria, Basilica, Apulia and Sicily are talking about the tropical climate. In the south of the country, the interest is growing in cultivating mango, avocado, papaya or goji beans. Why? Because the cultivation of these species allows the increasingly hot climate in southern Italy.
25192	13	In Apulia (i.e. the so-called Italian obcasie) exotic crops are already 500 hectares. The demand for exotic fruits is also growing. There is a further growth in this segment. Climate warming is often considered a conspiracy theory. One thing is certain, the climate has changed, changed and will change. In addition, the conditions for agricultural and gardening production are also in Poland.
25194	1	“The Hypocrisy.” Macron in the fire of criticism after disclosing vacation photos
25194	3	The President of France has been recognized by ecologists as an eco-hypocrisy. Emmanuel Macron was caught on a water scooter a few weeks after he called on his neighbors to save energy.
25194	5	Last month, Macron spoke to the French people with a hot appeal that society should engage in a “solidarity effort” aimed at protecting the environment and rational energy consumption. The French president also recommended the ministers to develop “energy savings” plans to reduce energy consumption by 10 percent. in the next two years.
25194	7	“We have to be prepared for a scenario in which we will have to complete without Russian gas. This is very likely. “We need a general mobilization,” Macron said during the celebration of the anniversary of the Great French Revolution.
25194	9	Ecological Hypocrisy
25194	11	Macron is famous for his admiration for water sports, especially driving on water scooters. Every year since 2017, the French president has been photographed on these vehicles.
25194	13	This week published photos show Macron, who is dedicated to good fun on these vehicles in the possession of the Fort de Brégançon Riviera, since 1968 the official residence of the French presidents. However, this time his driving on water scooters, which consume enormous amounts of fuel (from four to even ten times more than the average person's car), caused awkwardness among the members of the National Assembly.
25194	15	The Ambassador to the Green Sandrine Rousseau said: “This confirms the persistent impression that [Macron - etc. and red.) They do not understand climate change. Nowadays, it is a crime not to understand it.”
25194	17	"One member of the Macron party from La République En Marche told the tabloid ""Voici"" that he ""not trusted"" when he saw the photographs of the president on a scooter."
25194	19	Macron's Fall
25194	21	However, the fun on the fuel water scooters is not the only misconduct that ecologists accuse the president of France. Macron recently posted a few posts on Twitter about the crazy fires in France, which many activists have been linked to climate change.
25194	23	Interestingly, Macron himself said last month that the recent increase in the number of forest fires in the Mediterranean countries is “a consequence of climate change.”
25194	25	According to the activists, the president of France has been hypocritic by pointing out the effects of global warming, and by giving himself a fun that absorbs huge amounts of fuel.
25195	1	Do you want to remove Tusk?
25195	3	In the leadership of the PO, the idea of removing Donald Tusk from the leadership of the party begins to mature and already during the election campaign the leaders of the future coalition: Rafał Trzaskowski, Szymon Hołownia and Vladislav Kosiniak-Kamysz should enter his place. As former PO chief Grzegorz Schetyna says: “The company is interesting because it integrates opposition environments (...). It should be built by an agreing or reaching an agreement opposition.”
25195	5	The disclosure of such plans testifies to the weakening position of Tusk, as the public discussion of such a scenario would not so long have serious consequences, including the withdrawal from the party. One thing is certain, the return of Tuska did not cause an increase in notes, and on the contrary – a slight decline. The Social Changes employee survey a few days ago shows that KO could count on 25.4 percent. The United Nations and the United Nations are 39 percent. Such a result does not satisfy Tuska’s supporters, on the contrary – it causes an increase in dissatisfaction. But it’s not surprising, his denying statements compromise him and the party he represents. This slowly reaches the opposition supporters, that’s why Schetyn has revealed plans that are discussed in the opposition environment.
2527	1	Korwin-Mikke: Sanctions on Russia are completely absurd
2527	3	Sooner Russia can do it without gold than we can do it without gas. Indeed, the imposition of sanctions on Russia is a complete absurdity, the Confederation member and party chairman Janusz Korwin-Mikke said in a conversation with the portal DoRzeczy.pl.
2527	5	DoRzeczy.pl: Russia has turned Poland a pipeline with gas because our country did not agree to pay for the raw material in rubles. He criticized the Polish government's decision. Why?
2527	7	Janusz Korwin-Mikke: I am criticizing in the first place the action of Russia, which once turns, then turns the cabbage with gas. On the side of Russia, we have a situation of decisive fever, which is seen after the whole war, after how it is conducted. There is obviously something wrong in Russia, but this does not change the fact that our government has gone down by rejecting Russian gas and oil. If we got a cake, we should be happy.
2527	9	The government says we are prepared for that. We just need to be ready to raise prices.
2527	11	I have always explained that the sanctions work on both sides. On the one hand, of course, the Russians cease to receive money, but on the other hand, we cease to receive gas. Sooner Russia can do it without gold than we can do it without gas. In fact, imposing sanctions on Russia is completely absurd.
2527	13	Why?
2527	15	We say we don’t want to have anything to do with Russia, we don’t get gas and we wonder what now. Western countries impose a number of sanctions on Russia, but they want gas. Is this not absurd?
2527	17	So, how can we punish Russia for the situation in Ukraine?
2527	19	Soon, but why to punish? Can we punish other countries for their actions? We are not an international tribunal that will punish Russia, or Ukraine, or China. We can for example. The United States is offended for their actions. This is not done and the economy is not interfering with politics.
2527	21	There is a war, there is a genocide.
2527	23	Let’s say something clearly. I argue that Vladimir Putin has committed a war crime, because according to the Hague Convention it is not permissible to attack another state without declaring war to him. War in itself is not a crime. It is a normal way of resolving conflicts. The whole history of Europe is full of war. We do not call Alexander Macedonian a war criminal although during his wars more people were killed than during the Russian-Ukrainian war. We do not call the criminals Napoleon, Stefan Bator, or other leaders.
2527	25	You mentioned that the war is strange. So how?
2527	27	Russia started with the shooting of Kiev and Charkov, which is a complete notion. Therefore, civilians should not be shot. The war is conducted by states, not by civilians. The fact that Russia on the first day shot down and out of use the entire Ukrainian air force is a war with the state. Shooting civilians and bombing cities must be condemned.
2527	29	But do we not blend the economy?
2527	31	of course. If we want it, let us declare the war to Russia.
2527	33	The War?
2527	35	Yes. In Poland, there is a thesis that Ukraine is able to win the war with Russia. Spain is a country with similar potential. We also have a great, well-armed, army. If this is true, then please very much: let us declare the war to Russia and together with Ukraine we will surely defeat it. This is a reasonable action.
2527	37	Will the economic costs of the war for the whole world deepen?
2527	39	I don’t understand. If two countries run a war, then all the others earn it. They supply weapons to both sides, equipment, etc. Eastern countries never lose.
2527	41	But they lose citizens, the economy due to high inflation.
2527	43	Thanks to these stupid sanctions, the Americans are helping India and China, which get cheap gas and oil, because it is what the Russians sell them at a promotional price. I think we should also buy gas from Russia. We must not blend politics with war, as we must not blend politics and sport. I grew up in the time of the community. When our athletes did not go to the Olympics to Los Angeles for political reasons, then all protested. Today, sport is mixed with politics.
2527	45	How will the war in Ukraine end?
2527	47	I do not understand. My first reaction on February 24 was the thought that Vladimir Putin was crazy. It is not possible to predict what will happen next.
2527	49	During the authoritation of the conversation, Janusz Korwin-Mikke sent Post Scriptum: “Min. The UK Foreign Affairs just acknowledged that the Kingdom has long armed Ukraine and trained its soldiers. The United States and Canada. In that case, I am changing my opinion about this “guilt”: Russia should have placed an ultimatum to Ukraine ±5 years ago.”
2528	1	Russia can avoid bankruptcy. The Western sanctions machine clearly cut off
2528	3	It is uncertain whether the current sanctions will be sufficient to overthrow Vladimir Putin. But convincing the Union to the new Joe Biden will be very difficult.
2528	5	At the threshold of the second month of the war in western Ukraine, the machine to impose sanctions on Russia has clearly cut off. After four rounds of restrictions coordinated by the United States, the EU and the UK, no new initiatives are seen for now. And that despite the participation on Thursday in Brussels by Joe Biden at the EU and NATO summit would be a great opportunity to announce them.
2528	7	The U.S. President has made the matter clear from the beginning: States will not take direct participation in the Ukrainian war. Therefore, besides providing weapons to the Ukrainians, unprecedented sanctions have always been the main tool of the US to defeat the Kremlin. It was about raising the price of the invasion so high for Vladimir Putin’s surroundings and the wider Russian society to decide to overthrow the dictatorship or at least push it to stop the war.
2528	9	Decrease, but not drama
2528	11	Did it succeed? Diplomatic sources recommend patience. They believe that only in April the restrictions imposed by the West will be fully perceived to the Russians.
2528	13	Nevertheless, Goldman Sachs has announced its assessment of the impact of Bidena’s strategy. Her image is mixed. The bank is expected that the national income of the country will fall by 10 percent this year. This is as much as during the 1998 crisis, which forced Boris Yeltsin to leave and opened the way to power for Putin. Even in the midst of the financial crisis in 2009 recession (7.8 percent) She was more flat.
2528	15	However, in those cases it was a purely economic breakthrough without a conflict that could unite the Russians around power. Whether the Russian public opinion will actually be ready to sacrifice in the name of the restoration of the empire, it is not known. At the moment 58 percent. The respondents support the war, and 23 percent. They are against her. A huge role in this, however, is played by the Kremlin propaganda machine, which does not allow the truth to be known by the Russians, for example. The number of victims among Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Sooner or later, however, this will be revealed, as well as the economic costs of the invasion.
2528	17	The latter may be smaller than expected. Goldman Sachs says Russia will avoid uncontrolled bankruptcy. This is because it benefits the increase in the prices of raw materials, primarily energy carriers, caused by war. Therefore, according to the bank, even this year Moscow will keep the excess of the current account, which will allow it to pollute monetary restrictions (export prohibition of more than 5,000. The USD. It is also possible that the central bank will maintain a certain control over the rate of the ruble. Goldman Sachs is expecting 20% inflation. It’s so much, but not enough to get the prices out of control.
2528	19	On Monday, Zelensky called to the West to do more. He urged the Union to follow the traces of the United States and the United Kingdom that have imposed an embargo on the import of Russian oil. More: the President of Ukraine forced the cessation of all trade with Russia and the closure of European ports for its ships.
2528	22	Chemical weapons
2528	24	I doubt that this will happen, at least for now. Poland, the Baltic Countries, Denmark and Ireland belong to the narrow branch of the EU countries that are opposed to the suspension of Russian oil imports, but Germany is strongly against it. Berlin’s opposition, however, considers it a good pretext to reduce the costs of sanctions to a number of other EU countries, such as Italy and France. When it comes to a complete ceasefire of trade with Russia, Mateusz Morawiecki failed to convince even a key partner from the region: the Czech Republic.
2528	26	The Germans are afraid that further sharp sanctions will push the West into a deep economic crisis, among other things. This is due to the rapid increase in energy prices. The U.S. is taking care of something else. Before the departure to Europe, President Biden warned allies that Putin is increasingly likely to find chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s allegations that the Ukrainians are conducting a chemical weapons program with the support of the Americans: a good pretext to use this prohibited weapon.
2528	28	The White House is therefore afraid that Putin, increasingly disappointed by the situation on the front, will decide on uncontrolled movements. In this context, the imposition of sanctions on Russia may also be gradual – diplomates are considering.
2528	30	A sign of increasing frustration in Moscow is also the call to the U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan. He heard that Russia’s diplomatic relations with the United States are “on the threshold of breakdown” because Putin called it a “war criminal” last week.
2528	32	“A country that is disrupted by such a definition, and at the same time is constantly subjected to mass shooting on civilians, cannot be taken seriously,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price. The United States established diplomatic relations with the USSR in 1933 and never broke them.
2530	1	Embargo on oil and gas from Russia. The position of Le Pen
2530	3	Marine Le Pen, the rival of Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential seat race, said she strongly supports all sanctions against Russia, except those concerning the oil and gas embargo.
2530	5	In a recent interview to France Inter Radio Le Pen, which in two weeks in the second round of the elections will compete with the current president for the highest office in the country, she said she doesn’t want the “French to suffer the consequences of an embargo” on Russian oil and gas.
2530	7	France, like many other European countries, imports most of its natural gas by pipelines from Russia, using it to produce energy for housing and commercial purposes.
2530	9	I’m absolutely behind all the other sanctions,” Le Pen said. The candidate for the United Nations met with criticism for his words. In turn, during the election campaign, her political opponents caused her too close relations with Russia during the war in Ukraine.
2530	11	allegations of prophesianity
2530	13	Earlier, the UN leader seemed to support the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, and in 2017 called for the abolition of international sanctions on the matter.
2530	15	In 2014, when Crimea was annexed by Russia, its political party received a loan from a Russian bank.
2530	17	Marine Le Pen justified her position toward the annexation of Crimea by stating that Russia’s actions at the time were “an other situation” than the current invasion of Ukraine and presented her support to Putin as a reflection of her wider ambitions towards the “multiple” world.
2530	19	Despite the relief of its position on the leaving of the European Union and other nationalist issues in recent years, it is still facing the general opposition of the majority of the French political establishment.
2530	21	Former President Nicolas Sarkozy announced on Tuesday that he would vote for his party rival, Emmanuel Macron, and encouraged others to do so.
2537	1	“Live and let others live.” Why are the attempts to limit the meat consumption raising such emotions?
2537	3	More than 8 percent. The Poles are on a vegan or vegan diet. Meanwhile, Polish Minister of Agriculture Grzegorz Puda is advertising meat, and EU member Sylvia Spurek wants to promote veganism. What about meat on our dishes?
2537	5	Votes in the debate on the reduction of meat consumption refer to a variety of issues – from concerns about the future of farmers and the limitation of free choice to climate and animal welfare aspects.
2537	7	The EU is committed to achieving its climate objectives. by reducing the consumption of red meat among the inhabitants of the Community, however, it does not cease its promotion.
2537	9	Schools Without Meat
2537	11	Gregory Doucet, representative of the Green Party Mayor of Lyon, decided last week that the offer of tables in urban schools will not include meat meals. Gerald Darmanin, French Interior Minister, called this decision a “unacceptable image” for French farmers, and Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie called for “to not put ideology on the children’s plate.”
2537	13	However, as the mayor stated, the main argument was not to impose a vegan diet on the students, but to improve the service during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, his predecessor from the right party had to apply the same solutions at the beginning of the crisis.
2537	15	Although time limits have led to some groups – including farmers’ protests – in Lyon, there are schools where students have not eaten meat for many years. In 2015, the private school MUSE in California became the first educational facility in the United States where the table menu consisted of meals based solely on products of plant origin.
2537	17	At first, almost half of the students moved their children to other schools in fear of their health. The school’s director, in an interview with the Guardian, said that in case of such decisions, a confrontation should always be expected – as he said – not by facts, but by dezinformation.
2537	19	School vegetarianism is not a new thing. At the beginning of the 20th century, St. Christopher School was established in the UK. One of the principles on which the founders founded its functioning was respect for “all races and religions” and vegetarianism.
2537	21	Tolerance for all beliefs – but also people with a variety of dietary health conditions – was one of the three arguments of the director of the British Swan School, where students only have access to vegetarian gifts. The benefits of Kay Wood included the possibility of providing “better quality food for the same money” and greater environmental benefits.
2537	23	Similar proposals were presented two years ago by the councillors of the Warsaw district of Ochota – Sylvia Mróz, Agata Solecka and Anita Szymańska, and the president of Warsaw, Rafael Trzaskowski, appealed in this matter by the councillor Marek Szolc. A common element of the initiatives was the introduction of a day of vegetarian meals in the main schools so that, above all, vegetarian and vegetarian do not feel discriminated.
2537	25	The authorities of both districts and cities replied that such decisions belong to the parents, and in some Warsaw institutions students can choose between meat and non-meat taxes.
2537	27	At the same time, Warsaw in 2019 was ranked 6th in the ranking of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world – besides m.in. London, New York and Berlin. This classification was prepared by the HappyCow portal, which creates guides for the places open to the vegan cuisine. As written, the Polish capital has a wide range of easily accessible restaurants offering a vegan menu.
2537	29	Prohibitions or incentives?
2537	31	The question of who should decide about eating habits is also concerned with the proposal of the EU member Sylvia Spurek. Members of the European Parliament presented a plan. The “Five for the Plant Industry”, which is for example. prohibition of advertising meat, milk and eggs, the establishment of a veganism promotion fund and the completion of educational programmes – from pre-school to pre-school – on climate and animal rights.
2537	33	As Sylvia Spurek said in an interview with EURACTIV.pl her idea “is only the beginning of the debate on the changes that the modern agricultural industry has to pass. This will be a major change because it affects millions of citizens and citizens of the European Union.” “I think the role of politicians and politicians at such a special moment is to move the boundaries of the debate and introduce important topics to it,” she added.
2537	35	The public debate on this initiative focuses on two main points. The first of them represent people who believe that the consumption of animal products is healthy, and the prohibitions in this regard are an excessive interference in the lifestyle of citizens and can also have a devastating impact on Polish farmers.
2537	37	On the other hand, they are the supporters of the exclusion of meat from the diet – they recognize the proposals and arguments of the European Parliamentarians as obvious and natural. They also predict that over time more and more Poles and Poles will be convinced to leave animal products.
2537	39	A characteristic factor for every discussion about meat consumption and veganism are often extreme emotions. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, sociologist Jana Rückert-John tried to explain intense reactions in response to the proposals of systematic reduction of meat consumption and noted that “food is seen as one of the last remains of privacy in which no one has the right to interfere.” And meat is an essential part of this sphere, because it is also a indicator of well-being.
2537	41	A similar trend in the attitude of society to change habits is also noticed by Sylvia Spurek. “Controversie awakened the legal order to lock the bands in the car, the ban on smoking in public places, and even the ban on the use of physical punishments against children. But, as history has shown, the introduction of these ban on legal systems has also had an educational dimension, has changed the way of thinking about safety, health, human rights,” she said.
2537	43	According to the 2019 report, the interest in vegetable cuisine in Poland is actually increasing. In the analyzed period 8.4 percent. Poles were on the vegan or vegetarian diet, and 3.8 percent. They decided to limit the meat to fish. The most preferred meat – according to the analysis – is abandoned by young people aged 18 to 24 years.
2537	45	Fast food networks are also increasingly introduced to the vegetable menu. McDonald’s has signed an agreement with the U.S. company Beyond Meat to develop vegan meat substitutes. The first result of cooperation this year is to be a burger called McPlant. For two years, British KFC customers will be able to buy the “The Imposter” burger. The product resembles a traditional burger, but its kotlet is made of quorn – a fungal meat substitutes. In Poland, we will not be aware of this, but we will find in the fast food menu a vegetarian soap – from halloumi cheese. We also buy vegan hamburgers in most online food stores – from Biedronka, through Lidla, to Sheep.
2537	47	Ideology or strategy supported by facts?
2537	49	There is a common belief that – as Agriculture Minister Gregor Puda wrote on Twitter – “meat, milk, it got full of valuable nutrients products.” In turn, Sylvia Spurek points out that “we have huge knowledge about the correlation of milk consumption and accumulation with Parkinson’s disease, prostate cancer and breast cancer.”
2537	51	The EAT committee working with the scientific magazine Lancet, which examines the ways of eating in the context of both ecology and health, explains that “a healthy diet [...] consists mostly of a variety of products of plant origin and of a small amount of products of animal origin.”
2537	53	In order to adapt human habits to an optimal diet globally, according to the Lancet experts, it would be necessary to half increase the consumption of plant products and half reduce the consumption of animal products (this includes, along with meat, also and so on). I got an egg.
2537	55	If a general change in dietary habits occurred – according to the present estimates – even 11 million people per year would have a chance to live longer. Although some researchers disagree that removing meat – especially red – from the diet has a significant effect on improving health. In 2015, the World Health Organization recognized that excessive consumption of meat products could cause cancer changes.
2537	57	At the beginning of 2020, the European Greenpeace branch announced that in order to reduce agriculture’s contribution to the negative climate impact, the European Union’s meat consumption must decrease by 71 percent. by 2030 and 81% by 2050 (for FAO’s 2017 data below).
2537	59	As the creators of the climate science portal translate, the biggest impact on climate change is the so-called climate change. a long shade of farming, which includes “the emissions of greenhouse gases from the digestive systems of livestock,” but also – mostly – those associated with the implementation of the supply chain or landing areas to produce feed on them for animals.
2537	61	European Union for Health, Climate and Meat Producers
2537	63	In recent years, European institutions have often funded meat promotion campaigns. In 2015, the project “Smack, it comes from Europe” was launched. It aimed at increasing the attractiveness of European agricultural products in the EU and third countries. The funding for their promotions was intended to be increased “from 61 million euros in 2013 to 200 million euros in 2019”. A large part of the funds went to the meat industry.
2537	65	For example, in 2016, the Pork Lovers Europe project was approved to promote pork. Its authors noted that the consumption of this type of meat in the EU fell by 0.8 kg per capita between 2008 and 2015 (from respectively 41.7 kg to 40.9 kg). They also emphasized that “it is important to promote the pork and to restore consumers the certainty,” which could be encouraged, for example. World Health Organization Report on Meat Cancer.
2537	67	In 2019, Proud of EU Beef campaign was launched, with advertising spots encouraging bread to be consumed under the slogan “become a beefatarian”. The strategy makers explained that there is a need to improve the opinion about red meat because consumers refuse to buy it because of “the various types of information presented in recent times.”
2537	69	According to critics, the promotion of meat is a rejection of the EU’s climate and health objectives – the “from the field to the table” strategy and the “European Cancer Plan”, which confirms the importance of taking less animal products into the diet.
2537	71	Sylvia Spurek notes that the EU institutions not only promote animal products, but also do not support the plant industry. “The biggest plant startups are built behind the ocean, not in Europe. If the European Union is ambitious to be the leader of the green transformation, it cannot continue to bet on meat and milk. It must invest in the development of the vegetable industry,” therefore, according to the European Parliament, it needs “funds to support research and development of such a industry.”
2537	73	“For me it is obvious that, along with the necessary reduction in the demand for meat and milk, we need to provide access to alternatives for these products. Step by step they have to disappear from the roofs of the products that harm, and in their place – enter the products that are climate-friendly, created with the preservation of biodiversity and ethics. Unfortunately, in this regard, the European Commission seems to be paralyzed by fear of the opinion of a large lobby,” the EU parliamentary member summarized.
2537	75	How much meat do we eat?
2537	77	According to our World In Data portal, based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data, in 2017 the most meat in the EU was consumed by Spain – 100.25 kg per person per year.
2537	79	Portugal (94,06 kg) and Poland (88,7 kg) and Germany (87,78 kg) were in the second place. At the end of the EU list were Bulgaria (58.31 kg) and Slovakia (59.34 kg).
2537	81	For comparison, the largest amount of meat consumed worldwide is more than 120 kg (this group is for example. Hong Kong, the United States, Australia), and the lowest results – for example. In India, Bangladesh and Ethiopia, they do not exceed 5 kg.
2537	83	Meat consumption is the largest in high-income countries, and the average global meat consumption has increased by about 20 kg since 1961. However, two years ago the meat production dropped, and the trend remained in a pandemic year.
2537	85	One of the most obvious examples of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the meat consumption is the famous of the wool bakes in Argentina, where in 2020 for meat products it was required to pay even four times more than three years earlier.
2537	87	The Argentinians' minimum wages also fell, and therefore they could buy less such products. This has reached one of the lowest levels of meat consumption in the history of the South American state.
2537	89	This is a paradox because Argentina – as the “El País” writes – is one of the world’s largest bread producers. Last year the country sold overseas a record amount of bread throughout its history – 900,000. a ton of 2.7 billion. down. It is 6.5 percent. More than in 2019, according to data from the Chamber of Industry and Meat Trade (CICCRA). Most of them come to China.
2546	1	Does the war cover the plans of the unprecedented globalists? This is a conspiracy theory.
2546	3	Fake news in the pile 
2546	5	A short video appeared on Facebook in which it was convinced that the Russian invasion of Ukraine aims to distract the attention of people from the conspiracy of the world’s elites, who through a pandemic treaty are trying to take over the world and take away civil freedoms. 
2546	7	The pandemic treaty is not a mysterious and precious plan closer to the undefined world elites, and the intentions of its creation have been known since 2020. Its objective is to develop mechanisms that will allow to prevent and counter future pandemies.
2546	9	From one of the videos on Facebook we will find out as if the current war in the east of Europe was a planned action of closer to undefined global elites. Its objective is to distract the world’s attention from the covered war solutions that lead to humanity’s slavery.  The war in Ukraine is a real problem. People are killed in armed attacks. In the record, however, it was convinced that “this is not a war on the line of Russia against Ukraine or the United States against China. Only on the line degraded self-winning global elites against the entire world’s population” (time of recording 03:05). Such a request was drawn up on the basis of a number of false information that was spread on the network. He has no support in the facts.
2546	11	The Treaty on Pandemic Prevention and Preparation. Will the WHO take over the world?
2546	13	In the record presenting the theory of conspiracy, we hear that: “The first meeting of the intergovernmental negotiating body on the signing of the international treaty on prevention and pandemic preparation will be held in Geneva in the coming days, which will permanently eliminate 194 Member States from any decision-making and financial sovereignty in the field of health policy for the WHO” (time of recording 00:45). What is the international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparation? From 1 December 2021 the work is on the development of a “convention, agreement or other international instrument that would be a legally binding act of international law.”
2546	15	But the idea itself comes in 2020, when no one knew what could happen after two years, what we wrote in one of our latest analyses.
2546	17	As we can read on the website of the European Commission: “The instrument should define the objectives and basic principles that would enable the organization of a common, necessary fight against pandemies.” This is not an idea that should be feared.
2546	19	Scientists support a plan for joint recommendations
2546	21	According to the scientific environments, the development of such solutions is necessary in the face of progressive globalization and related pandemic threats.  The world of science is aware that there will be a further pandemic in the future. The development of the Treaty would enable the implementation of a number of benefits that could be incurred in effective risk prevention and combat.
2546	23	Information about the withdrawal of sovereignty and civil rights is false
2546	25	The next part of the film stated that: “If the treaty is signed (...) from now on, all decisions and regulations of the WHO will be considered to be superior and binding to the Member States, which will open the hole for the introduction of total digital control over the global population under the pretext of health protection (...)” (time of recording 01:15). This would lead to global censorship and public control. However, there is no evidence that the introduction of the Treaty would allow the nation to take away the sovereignty of health policy. The introduction of the treaty would enable cooperation against future pandemies, which the representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) are noting.
2546	27	“The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on many defects in the global pandemic protection system: the most unwavered people who have no vaccines, health workers without the necessary equipment to do life-saving work, and the ‘first-ever’ approach that undermines the global solidarity necessary to cope with the global threat.” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General
2546	29	Contrary to conspiracy theories, these are not solutions aimed at slavery or acting to harm the world’s population.  On the contrary, this would make it possible, in accordance with the will of the initiators, to coordinate cooperation more effectively on the international arena, while preserving the principles of solidarity, justice, inclusion and transparency.
2546	31	However, at the moment it is not possible to assess what form the treaty will take in the final version, as it has not yet been developed.  Proposal for dot. Thus, the loss of sovereignty of nations to the WHO has no justification and support in the previous conclusions, remaining contrary to the basic assumptions of the initiators.
2546	33	Receiving freedom by the duty of vaccination – how much is the truth?
2546	35	The messages, which were treated as evidence of the existence of a conspiracy, were the belief that in Poland will soon be introduced mandatory vaccines against COVID-19. As we hear on the recording: “In Poland, the project of the law on compulsory vaccines and covid passports has been influenced by the Sejm” (time of recording 00:15).  The groups covered by mandatory vaccines against COVID-19, included medical professionals, pharmacists, medical students and medical entities staff.
2546	37	The ideas for the introduction of compulsory vaccines for all Poles have been considered for a long time, but as so far, such solutions have not been developed, and the seminary work on them has not come to an end. It is also unclear what the final version of the law will look like.
2546	39	Will foreign troops in Poland receive our sovereignty?
2546	41	Moreover, the recipients are convinced that Poland consciously gives its sovereignty to the global conspiracy. As we hear: “The President a few days ago signed a document giving foreign troops a green light for the use of firearms and other means of direct force against the Poles” (time of recording 00:20).
2546	43	On the other hand, the allied armies in Poland – as some dezinforming news reports say – did not receive police powers, more of which you can read in one of the analyses published by us.
2546	45	Due to the tensions in Eastern Europe, selected offices in Poland may use weapons or means of direct force only in strictly specified situations that are related to the threat to health, life or property. 
2546	47	Summary
2546	49	The conspiracy theories are based on the assumption that hidden powerful forces stand behind harmful and tragic events (this must not necessarily be “world elites”). These, however, have that to themselves that they do not rely on any reliable evidence and very – even uncleanly – generalize the reality. They rely on the belief of the existence of the hidden truth, to which only a few have access, and also simplify the complexity of serious events in a zero-unique way, presenting reality as if it was the field of the struggle of good and evil.
2549	1	It has plans for Ukraine. It is a “one” of both countries.
2549	3	More than 4 million Ukrainian refugees have crossed the border with Poland. According to the report, every fourth Ukrainian refugees are planning to stay in Poland even when the war ends. However, it should include 2.5 million Ukrainian immigrants who were in Poland before 24 February, as well as another million who due to the difficult economic situation in Ukraine will undoubtedly come to Poland.
2549	5	PiS has taken action to show everyone how necessary assistance is to the Ukrainians arriving in Poland. At the time of the crisis on the border with Belarus, a different position was taken. Why? Because the Polish authorities did not realize the matter simply how to exploit the residents from the Middle East and Africa. Now PiS knows how it should deal with this matter in its own interest.
2549	7	First, in the short term, the government adopted a show to allow Ukrainians access to the labour market, the health and education system. In addition, they received access to the PESEL system, places in schools and primary schools. Even Polish citizens have never had such privileges. The maintenance expenditure for Ukrainian refugees is between 2 and 3 billion zlotys per month. The Polish government, however, justifies the withdrawal of money by the possibility of staying in power for the next few years.
2549	9	Moreover, in recent weeks, Warsaw has announced the acceptance of far-reaching declarations on cooperation. There was even information about the formation of the “one” of both countries. In these circumstances, the question arises why PiS decided to take such actions.
2549	11	The most obvious answer is that because this is the need for a moment, the reason of the state requires it. However, it is more likely that PiS expects that the aid to the Ukrainians will get their social support. At present, PiS sees millions of its faithful voters in the Ukrainians who will thank themselves for their help at the urns.  
2549	13	It looks very interesting PiS-ows political fantasy about the use of Ukrainians in the Polish political system. First, it is planned to give Ukrainians the right to vote in national elections (parliamentary elections in 2023, presidential elections in 2025), which requires Polish citizenship. They can be obtained by means of recognition, which relates to the need to meet certain conditions – in particular by several years of stay in Poland and language knowledge or by giving by the president. However, the President is not restricted by any conditions and may grant Polish citizenship to any foreign citizen. This solution will get PiS a potential gratitude to new Polish-Ukrainian citizens.
2549	15	In local elections, the situation is simpler. In the European Union, citizens residing in the Member State of whom they are citizens have the right to vote in local elections in that country. Some countries, for example. Scandinavians – granted the right to vote in local elections, under certain conditions, also to citizens of non-EU countries living there. In the coming months, Poland will be able to grant such a right to refugees from Ukraine. This only requires a change in the electoral order.
2549	17	Warsaw is delivering weapons and urging Kiev to take aggressive steps. But the most important thing that the Polish government wants is the breakdown of Ukraine. As a result, Warsaw will win both land and new thankful voters. And only then the PiS will be able to justify the billions of spending and maintain power. However, if something goes wrong, Poland is awaiting difficult and dangerous times.
2556	1	The end of love for the Ukrainians.
2556	3	We have seen a clear change in the attitude of the Poles towards refugees and migrants from Ukraine. The initial euforia and the outbreak of altruism have now been replaced by a much more pragmatic, “life” approach to the subject matter. Interesting information in this area was brought by a recent survey conducted by IBRiS for the journal “Rzeczpospolita”.
2556	5	Up to seven out of ten respondents want refugees from Ukraine to stay in Poland, but provided they take a job and stay independently. The second place is the education of children in the Polish school, and the third place is the teaching of the Polish language.
2556	7	76% of Ukrainians opt for specific conditions of residence in Poland. Men, most in the interval of 30-39 years (up to 83%), mostly living in large and smaller cities – 90% and 82%. Up to 97%. Parents are parents of families with at least two children.
2556	9	According to the “Rzeczpospolita”, the IBRiS survey corresponds to the recent studies carried out by the University of Warsaw under the direction of Dr. Robert Staniszewski. The result was that the majority of the Poles, although very favorable to the Ukrainians, are opposed to grant them 500+ benefits and social benefits in Poland.
2556	11	The expectations of the Poles are obviously noticed by the government, which from 1 July no longer wants to finance accommodation and food for Ukrainian refugees and migrants. This will lead to the isolation of the Ukrainians. By the end of May, there were 160,000 legal jobs. Newly arrived Ukrainian citizens. This is not even 30% of the population of refugees and migrants of the new wave in the working age.
2556	13	So we can say that it was exactly what we predicted (and published on the posts of the Polish Thought) click months ago. We predicted that although the Poles will continue to be basically affectionate to the Ukrainians, the feelings will gradually be clearly cooled. We expected that we will soon realize that we are paying for the generosity of the government. Therefore, we will be increasingly opposed to the allocation of 500+ and other social benefits to the Ukrainians. Moreover, the economic situation in both our domestic budgets and in the scale of the whole country will be increasingly difficult a month by month.
2556	15	This is already happening. But it is not finished yet. With the growth of the economic crisis, nationality antagonism will be increasing. Moreover, the long-term conflict leads to natural fatigue and burning empathy. This year, the first major tensions will come.
2556	17	Unfortunately, the rulers rather than listening to the gentle streets preferred to focus in recent months on suppressing the opposition and stigmatizing it as “Russian onucs.” Together we were able to avoid many expensive mistakes. In the meantime, we will soon come to pay the salt invoice for the dissolution of Kaczynski and Morawiecki. And no assertion like “Glory to Ukraine!” will change this fact.
2558	1	Dmitry Muratov sold the Nobel medal for $103.5 million
2558	3	"In war conditions it is possible and necessary to remain a decent man, not the face of the ""Putin's friends"" group. “Putin’s friends,” even living in democratic countries, declare the “weakness” of this form of governments and dream of a “strong hand” or a “new world order.” Dmitry Murato's action should be an example for Russian and Western intellectuals, mostly so and undecision about the war in Ukraine. "
2558	5	The medal winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, the chief editor of «New Gaza» Dmitry Muratowa, was sold at an auction in the United States for $103 and a half million. This was on the website of the U.S. trade house «Heritage Auctions», which conducted the auction. The name of the buyer is unknown.
2558	7	All the revenue from the sale of the prize will be transferred to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to help Ukrainian minors and their families. The auction was held on the occasion of the World Refugee Day, which is celebrated on June 20.
2558	9	This fact is an example for Russian and Western intellectuals, mostly unsuccessful about the war in Ukraine.
2558	11	"The phenomenon of intellectual support for Russian fascism / parallel with Hitler's Germans. Intellectuals see totalitarian regimes as a chance for a ""new order""."
2558	13	Russia is based not only on a powerful propaganda machine, but also on intellectuals in many countries of the world.
2558	15	The reasons for this phenomenon are the abundant paying “work” by the conditional Gazprom, the nostalgia for emigration, the revolutionary hobby of the left of radical persecution (especially in Latin America), the cover of the great Russian culture, etc.
2558	17	This all led to the fact that everything that existed in the space of the former USSR was ceased to be perceived at all. Russia is currently implementing this idea in relation to its national periphery, as well as the countries of Central Asia, namely the former Soviet republics.
2558	19	"This is precisely and covers the fundamental mistake of Russia in Ukraine and its misunderstanding for the Baltic States. The Russian autocrats, focused on the realization of imperial ambitions, dream of the Russian Empire 2.0 as a ""Russian Empire"". And therefore any attempts to join by countries from the ancient zone of influence to other associations/initiatives – the EU, the Triangle, etc. They are so sensitive."
2558	21	It is time for European intellectuals to begin to see countries from the orbit of the former USSR, that is, Ukraine, Kazakhstan as independent and active players.
2559	1	The deportation of Ukrainians to Russia gets a terrible scale
2559	3	Since the beginning of the war against Ukraine, the full-scale Russian troops, in addition to all possible crimes committed against humanity, have carried out mass deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation using violence. The exact number of people deported is unknown, as most such cases are done in the occupied territories, but it is estimated from 800 thousand to 1.5 million people, of which about 300 thousand are children. 
2559	5	Putin will discuss the issue of occupation of Ukraine in a systematic and comprehensive manner. Human factor is one of the most important factors and has a special importance for Russia. Exporting Ukrainians (mainly in the youth, reproductive and productive age), Putin thus addresses the demographic problem of Russia, which has gained catastrophic dimensions in the years 2021-2022, and is important for the remote, poor regions of Russia, which are becoming unemployed, and in some villages there is a lack of hands to work. The President of the Russian Federation specially signed a law on the forced displacement of more than 100,000 Ukrainians to Siberia and for the suburban circle, as well as giving them Russian citizenship in an accelerated manner. As Stalin forcefully deported Ukrainians in the 30-40s of the 20th century, using their work as a locomotive to create housing and industrial infrastructure in the USSR, so the Russian dictator plans to use Ukrainians in the role of legal slaves in the most difficult to reside regions.
2559	7	Putin has left Ukraine without human resources. According to his concept, the Ukrainians should either be eliminated or displaced (de facto remain the exterminators of their own country) to the final solution of the Ukrainian issue. The option to move Ukrainians to Europe is not the right solution for Russia, as Ukrainian refugees can return and become a serious problem for Russia. The Russian propaganda is so effective that there can be an alternative understanding of the existing situation about the causes and meaning of the present Russian-Ukrainian war, an understanding in the spirit of the political narratives of the Kremlin. And in the situation of their return to Ukraine, these people will be a reflection of the Putin needed concepts for Ukrainian audiences.
2559	9	Thus, the deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation immediately resolves two issues and becomes dangerous. The Ukrainians are exported to the Russian Federation through the so-called “green corridors” for peaceful evacuation of civilians. So, in just one day, on 24 March, more than 15 thousand inhabitants were deported from Mariupola to Rostowa nad Don. People are deported to the filtering camps to Taganrog or Rostow to the next redirect to Siberia, the Far East and the suburbs. Russia completely violates the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Civil Population and actually dictates its conditions to the Ukrainians on the occupied territories. The displaced persons are left without documents, in return they get work and apartment. Their return to Ukraine is too difficult and complicated, requiring the participation of third countries to provide assistance to cross the border.
2559	11	Putin seeks to give this war a long-term, tired and exhaustive character for Ukraine, whose goals are achieved not only in the field of battle, but also through other tools of hybrid war. Forced deportation is one of the variants of the genocide on the Ukrainians: the Russian totalitarian state forced the Ukrainians from their homeland as the Ottoman Empire in the last years of its rule moved and expelled the Anatolian Greeks. Putin has created a massive geopolitical, ethnographic and social catastrophe of the 21st century, the tragedy of which is enlarging with every day of this war.
2560	1	Ukraine is not worthy of a nuclear war
2560	3	The alleged friends of Kiev in Poland offer Armageddon.
2560	5	As Russia progresses slowly in the heavy battles in the east of Ukraine, more and more people talk about impasse, and even possible Russian re-attack on Kiev. This intensified the demand of Zelensky's team for increasingly advanced weapons from the United States and Europe.
2560	7	However, these demands may be too small and delayed. Deliveries are susceptible to Russian attack, and weapons require training, some of which are complex and long. Moreover, while Russia initially suffered severe losses, the current artillery attack costs Ukraine part of the best-trained soldiers. The ability of Kiev to further resist Moscow attacks is uncertain.
2560	9	To date, Washington and other European capitals have focused on accelerating the supply of weapons. But Polish politician Radosław Sikorski, the former Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs, who is currently sitting in the European Parliament, proposed a radical alternative: arming Ukraine with nuclear weapons. Sikorsky said: “Because Russia has violated the Budapest memorandum, I think that we as the West would have the right to supply Ukraine with nuclear heads.”
2560	11	His justification is wrong. The 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which regulated Kiev’s withdrawal of nuclear weapons left after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, included a commitment of the parties to “to seek immediate action by the UN Security Council to provide assistance to Ukraine” if it is attacked or threatened by a nuclear weapons attack. It was a meaningless promise, because the only alleged potential aggressor, Russia, had a veto that it could interfere with the UN. However, Kiev signed it with the awareness that the agreement does not provide any significant security guarantees.
2560	13	Without a doubt, Kyiv could now regret that he did not give his inherited nuclear arsenal, although he was lacking operational control of the weapons. Given the U.S. and especially European commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, it would be difficult for Ukraine to maintain its nuclear weapons as it seeks to integrate with the West. India paid a significant economic price for developing its arsenal before George W. Bush’s administration accepted reality and New Delhi as a nuclear power.
2560	15	The opportunity of Ukraine has passed a long time ago. And no one suggested the transfer of nuclear weapons to Kiev in the period preceding the Russian attack, which would likely aggravate the crisis and accelerate the invasion of Moscow. Doing this today, when the war is already crazy, would threaten the transformation and so already terrible conflict into a real catastrophe.
2560	17	During the Cold War, nuclear weapons probably helped prevent a conventional conflict on a full scale between the US and the USSR. However, if there was a war between them, the possession of nuclear weapons would significantly increase the danger. The losing side would have the temptation to use nuclear weapons to restore balance. Indeed, throughout the Cold War, Washington, which had a smaller army, threatened to respond to the invasion of Western Europe with nuclear weapons. The situation between Russia and the United States has changed.
2560	19	India and Pakistan were not the nuclear powers when three full-scale wars began. Their ability to destroy each other could prevent the fourth conflict, although they organized a limited but long-lasting war in Kashmir in 1999, known as the Kargil War, after both countries tested nuclear weapons. Pakistani provocations, such as terrorist attacks on the Indian parliament in 2001 and Bombay in 2008, threatened a war that could be stopped by fear of nuclear weapons.
2560	21	"Of course, Ukraine needs more than nuclear weapons to become a nuclear power. He would also need transportation means – aircraft or missiles, along with related training. And, of course, such a plan could not be easily kept in secret. Moscow can prevently respond with nuclear weapons to prevent Ukraine from deploying operational forces. After Sikorsky's speech, the head of the Russian Duma Wiachevław Wołodin warned: ""Sikorsky is provoking a nuclear conflict in the center of Europe. They don’t think about the future of Ukraine or Poland. If his proposals are implemented, those countries will disappear, just like Europe.”"
2560	23	In any case, the idea is unrealisable. Among the allies, only the United States, France and the UK have nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to find a diplomatic outcome from the war. British Boris Johnson would hesitate whether to deepen his European status as a parias by transferring nuclear weapons to Ukraine. President Joe Biden has just returned from a trip to South Korea, where he confirmed Washington’s determination to denuclearise North Korea. Even the Polish government, competing with the Baltic countries in calling for NATO involvement in Ukraine, did not support Sikorsky’s proposal.
2560	25	However, the fact that once a serious politician would argue for the transformation of the ongoing conflict into a nuclear confrontation shows how dangerous this conflict has become. The invasion of Moscow was unjustified. However, the allied attempt to make Ukraine a winner – increasingly supported by the supporters of Ukraine in the U.S. political elite – threatens an escalation of war from Russia.
2560	27	President Vladimir Putin cannot afford a loss and has measures to avoid it, including the ability to start full military mobilization and use weapons of mass destruction – chemical, nuclear or both. Moscow has a higher rate and therefore it will always be willing to pay and risk more. The U.S. has nothing strange to justify the risk of the nuclear disaster of Kiev. However, some decision makers are ready to take advantage of this opportunity. Indeed, both Senator Mitt Romney and Evelyn Farkas from the McCain Institute would do that even if Russia used nuclear weapons against someone else, which would be crazyly an irresponsible position that would threaten the future of America.
2560	29	The general support for Ukraine is understandable. However, this should not be done at the expense of the US security. The highest priority of the administration of Bidena is the security of America, its inhabitants, territory, freedom and well-being. This puts on the daily order the need for a quick ending of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The longer it lasts, the greater the damage to Ukraine, the danger to Europe and the danger to America. And the more people may be tempted to try extreme ideas, such as Sikorsky. The nuclear power in a state of war would be a terrible view.
2561	1	When lies come home
2561	3	During the Russian-Ukrainian war, all articles about Russia and Ukraine may contain propaganda content that is beneficial to any of the parties in the conflict. The following article for Russia comes from the American medium.
2561	5	After months of lies, the media are preparing audiences for the military collapse of Ukraine.
2561	7	Diogenes, one of the brightest philosophers of the ancient world, believed that lies were the currency of politics and that lies were the ones he sought to reveal and depreciate. To emphasize his point of view, he sometimes walked with a flame around the streets of Athens on a white day. If you asked him why he did it, he would answer that he is looking for a fair man.
2561	9	Finding a fair man in Washington today is an equally big challenge. Diogenes would need xenon reflectors in both hands.
2561	11	However, there are still short moments of light in the Washington establishment. For months of cheating the American audience about the causes and course of the war in Ukraine, the media are now preparing American, British and other Western audiences for the military disaster of Ukraine. This is a delayed operation.
2561	13	The Western media has done everything in their power to make the impression that the defense of Ukraine has much greater strength than it actually has. Careful observers noticed that the same videos showing the attack on Russian tanks were shown several times. Local contracts were presented as if they were operational maneuver.
2561	15	The Russian errors were immense and disproportionate to their actual significance. The Russian losses and the actual sizes of losses of Ukraine were distorted, manufactured or simply ignored. But the conditions of the battlefield have changed a little over that time. When the Ukrainian forces stopped on static defence positions in urban areas and in the central Donbass, the position of the Ukrainians became hopeless. But this development of the situation was presented as a failure of the Russians who did not “their set goals.”
2561	17	Land troops that invade their soldiers on prepared defence lines will be recognized, targeted and destroyed from a distance. When stable air intelligence, observation and detection devices, crew or unmanned, are connected with accurate guided weapons or modern artillery systems operating on the basis of accurate target data, “holding position” is fatal for any ground force. This is more true in Ukraine, where from the very beginning of the Russian actions it was clear that they are concerned with the destruction of the Ukrainian forces, and not the occupation of the cities or territories of Ukraine west of Dnipr.
2561	19	The result was – piece by piece – the anihilation of the Ukrainian forces. Only the episodic flow of weapons from the U.S. and its allies allowed the field to beined by the Kiev Legions. The Legions who are now dying with great losses because they are leading war in place of Washington.
2561	21	The war with Moscow is lost. The Ukrainian forces are deprived of everything. The trained reserves do not exist in such a amount to affect the battle situation, and this worsenes with every hour. No military aid or in the form of advisors can change this brutal reality, with one exception – the direct intervention of the US and NATO land forces.
2561	23	The problem today is not the surrender of the territory and the population of Eastern Ukraine to Moscow, which Moscow is now under control. The future of the regions of Chersonia, Zaporozha, along with the Donbass, is already overlooked. Moscow is likely to safeguard the Chark and Odessa, two historically Russian and Russian-speaking cities, as well as its adjacent territories. These operations will cause the conflict to extend to the summer. The problem today is how to stop fighting.
2561	25	Whether the fighting ends early in the autumn depends on two main factors. The first is on the side of the government in Kiev. Will the Zelensky government agree to the Bidenov concept of a permanent conflict with Russia?
2561	27	If the Biden administration puts it on its own, Kyiv will continue to function as a base for creating new forces capable of threatening Moscow. In practice, this means Kiev’s national suicide by opening the heart of Ukraine west of Dnipr to devastating long-range missile attacks and missile forces.
2561	29	Of course, such a development of accidents is not inevitable. Berlin, Paris, Rome, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Vilnius, Riga, Tallin and so on, even Warsaw, don’t have to blindly follow Washington. Europeans, like the majority of Americans, are looking into a blurry that covers all the areas of the economic collapse that Biden has already led to in his own country. However, unlike the Americans who have to deal with the consequences of Biden’s corrupt policy, European governments still have the option to reject Biden’s permanent war plan in Ukraine.
2561	31	The second is Washington itself. After pumping already $60 billion, or a little more than $18 billion a month into the Ukrainian state that holds in positions, through direct or indirect transfers, the fundamental question sounds what’s going on with the Ukrainians from the rest of the country who have not fled? Where will the funds be taken to restore the divided society of Ukraine in the emerging global economic crisis?
2561	33	When inflation caused the cost of an average U.S. home to rise by $460 a month for the purchase of the same goods and services compared to the previous year, it is quite likely that Ukraine could calmly drown into the rejection waves like Titanic, without causing greater interest in the U.S. electorate. Experienced politicians know that the time period in which Americans focus on non-American affairs is very short, that confessing to a failure in Ukraine is likely to have little or no direct consequences.
2561	35	However, the effects of repeated strategic failures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria are accumulating. in the 1980s. General Motors wanted to dictate the Americans what cars they should buy, but American consumers had a different opinion. Therefore, GM, which has dominated the U.S. market for 77 years, has lost its position for Toyota. Washington cannot impose all the consequences, nor can it escape from the responsibility for its disruptive expenditure and the destruction of American well-being.
2561	37	In November, the Americans will go to the urn. The electorate himself will do more than just test the U.S. electoral system. The elections will also likely make Biden remembered for his lack of ability to compromise, for his refusal to change the course, like Herbert Hoover in 1932. Democrats will remember that their predecessors in the Democratic Party have effectively fought with Hoover for more than half a century.Republicans can fought with Joe Biden for the next 50 years.
2561	38	Explanation from the translator
2561	40	The last two sentences are understandable for people interested in the U.S. internal policy. Herbert Hoover, a Republican, won the elections in 1928 and then lost decisively against the F.D. Roosevelt in 1932. He has been remembered as the President of the Great Crisis, who has not suffered him and despite the many positive sides of his presidency, his term in the general reception is considered a failure. In turn, “50 years” could mean the US Democrats’ advantage over the time of Ronald Reagan despite the fact that the Republican presidents occurred at that time, but as Eisenhower was basically only candidates to the GOP, or compromised as Nixon. The author suggests that Biden's term will be remembered as a failure, and Republicans will be easier to win for the next 50 years.
2564	1	Gregor Braun and scientists. Peace in Ukraine
2564	3	As a national-radical environment we have our position on the war in Ukraine (read HERE), but we also present other views, because this is the mission of the portal Nazionalista.pl since 2005. Here is a statement read in the Sejm by deputy Gregor Braun.
2564	5	    The people and organizations gathered here call on the immediate end of the war in Ukraine and a compromise between Russia and Ukraine that will lead to permanent peace. The war is the greatest human and cultural tragedy. Every day, people die on both sides: they take with themselves their dreams and the personal potential they represent. This is a great human tragedy. The war has to do with expulsion. During this period there are crimes and crimes of war. War teaches us hostility and hatred. It degenerates us as people. In the name of the defense of our lives and humanity, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine must be immediately stopped.
2564	7	    The current war involving NATO states providing Ukraine with modern weapons, including offensive, is the most dangerous armed conflict since World War II. It is a major threat to the world’s economic situation and to the world’s peace. The population of many countries is now at risk of hunger due to the decrease in grain exports from Ukraine and Russia. In addition, there is a sharp rise in the world of fuel prices, whose manufacturer is Russia. As a result, we are threatened by a global economic crisis, with even unimaginable consequences. Even greater tragedy will be the situation when the present war goes out of control and from the local conflict turns into a continental war or another world war. This will mean hundreds of millions of victims, the destruction of states and the fall of all our civilizational achievements.
2564	9	    We believe that for peace and conflict solving it is necessary to understand its causes well. The main factor that often stands in the causes of war is fear. In this case, it is the fear of Russia for NATO expansion and the fear of neighboring countries for the power of Russia. For the resolution of the conflict, therefore, mutual fear must be removed, and only professional diplomacy and willingness to compromise can lead to it, not war actions. Another reason for the current war, which is less mentioned, is the introduction of changes in the language law in Ukraine, discriminating the language minority of Russia. This led to a referendum in Crimea and a war in Donbass. Therefore, the current war is also a consequence of incorrect internal policy. It leads to a great human tragedy and massive destruction. The affairs are not resolved by a war and by attracting the whole world into it, but by a conversation and a compromise. We call for dialogue, for compromise and for peace.
2564	11	    In the globalized world in which we live, states are co-dependent. Due to the global position of Russia and Ukraine, the consequences of the current war have a disastrous impact on the whole world. It is not too late to resolve this conflict that is very harmful and dangerous for us all. We call for reason, for memory and for peace.
2564	13	    Nothing is lost by peace. Everything can be lost by war” (Pius XII, 1939).

On the other hand, NOP nationalists picketed their time as part of solidarity in front of the detention building, to which Grzegorz Braun came for “the image of the court.”
2569	1	Donald Tusk: It’s going to end, it’s going to end
2569	3	If someone was able to fight the dwarf, take the inflation and push it to zero, it was my government, the President of the Civil Platform Donald Tusk said on Saturday during the party's convention.
2569	5	The essence of a good government is the ability to provide people with good and cheap bread and cold and hot water in the crane,” said Donald Tusk, the leader of the Platform. While PiS will continue to rule, at the end of the year bread can cost up to 30 PLN, he added.
2569	7	"In the audience-sports hall of the Radomsky Sports Center took place on Saturday ""Convention of the Future"" of the Civil Platform. According to organizers, there were almost 6,000. The people. The podium from which the PO politicians spoke was set in the middle of the hall, like a boxing ring. It was at the same time an annexation to the first PO convention in 2001, when the then PO leaders Donald Tusk, Andrzej Olechowski and Maciej Płażyński stood on a similar ""platform""."
2569	9	The first vote was taken by Platform President Donald Tusk, who spoke for more than 40 minutes. “It’s not a coincidence that just here, just you, and not anyone else, show Poland, where there is strength, where there is good will, where there is hope for change,” Tusk said.
2569	11	In his speech, he called for an annual re-leading of the Platform. He has visited 100 towns over the past few months. “I’ve met people on this path, who like you, like today, almost all of Poland, are very busy with what’s happening in our homeland. They are even sometimes broken by the experiences that fall on them, and at the same time they have hope and belief that this situation can be changed,” he said.
2569	13	Tusk added that he invited the convention to host some of his meetings. “These are not people involved in political activities. They were those who wanted to talk to me, although, as you know, it may not always be easy,” he said. “We live today in a country where we need to have personal courage to speak publicly with the opposition leader,” he said.
2569	15	"He said that through talks with farmers he understood why ""the Polish village turns away today from the rulers, why the Polish farmers feel cheated today by the rulers."" “For they were deceived,” he said. “What does it mean to calculate and plan a profitable production in a situation where artificial fertilizers increased by 700-800 percent over the course of the year, not to mention fuel,” he added."
2569	17	He also talked about police officers. “Polish police officers and Polish police officers go to service – almost everyone without exception – to defend Poles and pursue bandits, not to defend authorities from citizens.”
2569	19	He described his meeting on the Village Street with the police, who before returning to him, looked closely around each other. “They tell me, Mr. Prime Minister, maybe you’d finally make an order with it, because we wanted to be in the police to pursue the bandits, not hours, days and weeks to stand under the Sejm or on the Novgorod,” Tusk said. He said that “the police are largely victims of the system that PiS built in Poland – they really want to help us, not to interfere with it.”
2569	21	Tusk also emphasized the situation of teachers. “Today we have older and older teachers in the Polish school – for obvious reasons. Indeed, this profession, which should be one of the most attractive – because we all respect and love our teachers and our teachers – has become the most probably humiliating profession. To teachers and teachers this authority in the same week, when it gave itself – to ministers, to the president, to the prime minister – an increase of 40 to 60 percent. At the same time, she told Polish teachers and teachers that they could get 4 percent. Inflation increases by 16%. He said. “We will never forget that humiliation, that fool in the face of people,” the PO leader said.
2569	23	Giving examples of entrepreneurs running small – owners of bistro and baker – he said that “It is very clear that the situation in the entire Polish economy begins to be critical.”
2569	25	It is estimated that one-third of gastronomic sites in Poland may not survive until the end of the year. He referred to the IBRiS survey, which showed that 35 percent of families gave up their scheduled holidays; one-third of families had to reduce food spending, the same percentage gave up purchases of AGD and RTV devices. According to Tuska, “It is very clear that the situation in the entire Polish economy begins to be critical.”
2569	27	"""The essence of a good government is the ability to provide people with good and cheap bread and cold and warm water in the crane,"" Tusk said. Meanwhile, if the PiS will continue to rule, then - here he called on experts - a bottle of bread will cost 10 zlotys at the end of the year, or even 30 zlotys."
2569	29	“What happened that they for seven years from Poland, a truly flourishing country, the pride of Europe, made a country where the problem is water and bread?” He asked.
2569	31	“What is the real source of this literary road, that inflation that in Poland is already record in Europe? Why should it be the most expensive? The reason for this scripture is jealousy and stupidity,” Tusk said.
2569	33	He insisted that one of the greatest pro-inflation impulses is the “legion of PiS-owsk activists who have swallowed themselves into the corporations of state treasure and take the state without remembering.” “It ends, it ends, it ends,” he said.
2569	35	"He accused NBP President Adam Glapiński of lack of competence and unable to predict, reminding his statements less than two years ago of deflation as a threat and ""the expected threat of inflation explosion""."
2569	37	"He said that in November. The head of the central bank predicted a drop in inflation, and said that ""this is almost the same day when Prime Minister Morawiecki spent millions of dollars on bonds that were intended to protect his private savings from inflation."""
2569	39	"""He assumed that inflation would be huge, but he didn't tell the Poles. In silence, in secret before the citizens, the rulers secure themselves heavy money,” the chairman said. “The Thieves!” They scandalized the collections."
2569	41	"The leader of the Civil Platform also said that if the PO wins the elections, ""Glapinsky will be removed from the NBP."" ""Adam Glapiński is not only incompetent, not only uncompetent in what he does. Adam Glapiński is illegal. He will not be the chairman of the NBP for a day. There will be no need for the law,” said the platform leader."
2569	43	He reminded that the legal obstacles related to the re-election of Glapiński for the second term in the National Bank of Poland were indicated by experts of the Office of the President. “It would be much less doubt to get guests out of the NBP. And I will do it, I will guarantee it to you,” Tusk said. According to the Law on the National Bank of Poland, the Board of Directors of the National Bank of Poland may not be more than two seats. Prior to the election of Adam Glapiński for the second term, the head of the NBP was said that he had already completed his two term in the bank’s authorities, since in 2016 he had been in the NBP for several months.
2569	45	He thanked all those who participated, among other things. The Democratic Defence Committee went on the streets. “Thank you survived the belief that it is worth establishing your own committees and driving arrogant power, organizing and organizing all the people of good will,” he said.
2569	47	He reminded the slogan of Jack Kuronia: Don’t finger the committees, assume your own, relating to the burning of the gmacha of the Soviet PPR Committee in Radomiu in June 1976.
2569	49	"He pointed out at the same time that it is in Radomium that he can say that as he compares the picture of Radomium from 1976 to today's Poland, that ""this picture is so similar that it can lead to disappointment."""
2569	51	"He added that PiS President Jaroslav Kaczynski is “a representative of power that shides, humbles, neglect people, including often children, who need special sensitivity.” He pointed to ""Kazzinsky's rhetoric, it is Kazzinsky's shield and the people of power over the disabled."" “Do you remember this press conference on the street because disabled people were not allowed to enter the Sejm? He said to them, “Wan! The summit is for us, and you can organize yourself on the street,” he said to the convention participants."
2569	53	"""We are also here so that the authority will never neglect the weak people again,"" he said."
2569	55	At the same time, he said, “it will come a moment that we all will be organized on the street, if this power does not disappear.”
2569	57	"Referring to the rights of the weakest, ""those who need help, and at least understanding and respect,"" he said, ""there is zero tolerance and zero compassion for those who are looking for some dull compromises here."" He said that the program will be. “With this hypocrisy, with this lies, for example. It is a committee that investigates pedophilia.”"
2569	59	“As soon as we take over the power, as soon as we win the elections (...) it will not be that whether it is a politician, a marshal of the Sejm, a bishop, a minister, a high official... it will not be that in the matters of children’s injuries, pedophilia, violence against children, there will be some holy unmatched cows,” he said.
2569	61	“They will no longer be holy, unclean cows. “Only children in Poland are holy and unreliable,” he said.
2569	63	The leader of the Civil Platform also reminded that he is a father and grandfather. “And I call to my fathers and grandparents: if you have a daughter, a grandson, like me, you can’t vote for the love of God,” Tusk said. “They have indeed thrown the hell to women and they are thrown the hell to your daughters and your grandchildren.”
2569	65	He insisted that he was the recipient of many requests or alarms about what is happening in the Polish houses because the current government team has no idea of life. “I’m sorry that I’m brutal, but what do you know, gentlemen: Kaczynski, Rydzik, Yizrashevsky, about God’s love, about maternity, about fatherhood, family, sex, bed? He asked Tusk, what the hall responded enthusiastically, with graceful brave.
2569	67	He called on his fathers and grandparents to “talk” with his daughters and grandchildren. “Truly, they will tell you everything, coffee to the lake,” he encouraged. “And I say that as a Christian. People, if someone believes in God, feels a Christian, then he can vote for the party that has Mesha, Kursky... What are we talking about? The head of the platform was surprised.
2569	69	“Listen, can you vote for lies, theft, dishonesty, hatred?” He asked. “You believe in God, you don’t vote for the PIS, it’s simple as a wire,” he added.
2571	1	Grzegorz Braun about life and family – answers to questions to presidential candidates
2571	3	On the questions asked by the PRO Foundation, the candidate for President Grzegorz Braun was the first to answer. Below we publish the full list sent to the edition of our portal.
2571	5	Dear state,
2571	7	Thank you for the letter – the answers to the questions in it to give will come to me as easy that in fact I have given them a long time and not once. Many times I have had the opportunity to speak publicly on topics that, like you, I consider crucial to the fate of the people and the state of Poland, or more, of the entire Latin civilization. As the author of documentary films generally received as a clear voice for life, and against the unhuman eugenic theories and criminal abortion practices – notabene frequently exposed to aggressive criticism from the centers of anti-Polish and anti-Catholic propaganda – I have, as I think, given a sufficiently resolute expression to my primary position. I refer to all those interested in my opinions, therefore, first and foremost, to the films: “Eugenika – in the name of progress” and “not about Mary Wagner”, in which I have managed, hopefully, to draw a sufficiently broad argumentation and exemplification relating to all the issues you raise. I understand, however, that the announcement of my candidacy in the upcoming presidential elections creates a new situation in which it is understandable to expect that the opinions previously spread in various publications (except for film, also press, radio, etc.).Now they will be collected and clearly repeated – what I do with this (bearing the number of questions that you have given).
2571	9	1. So, do I believe that the Polish law should protect every man from conception? So is. I definitely think so. I understand that when you speak of the “protection of man” you consider the legal protection of every human life – regardless of age, health, state of immobility, etc. Of course, the law cannot make any exceptions from this principle that arise from an arbitrary assessment of the “quality” or the level of expectations of others in respect of human life. (I do, of course, an exception for adults who, by their thoughtful action, are out of law, i.e., murders with premeditation, state traitors, spies and deserters in the face of the enemy – giving these criminals a legal life guarantee is, by the way, a terrible and absurd harassment – for the use of such cases I strictly pursue the restriction of the main punishment).
2571	11	In particular, do I think that children suspected of a disease or genetic deficiency, can be lived through abortion? No, in no case. In the film “No about Mary Wagner” I have presented, as I think, a sufficiently broad argumentation and an exemplification that translates such a position. The Evaluation Concept. “The imperfection” of our neighbors and the judgment on this basis, who “deserves” to live, is in essence a horrendous glory – and in practical consequences, it is known, leads to the line of innocent. I will therefore reject any legal solution that makes such practices unpunished. I do not agree with the rule of the III RP. The abortion compromise. I remind that this is the legal state that puts us at the level of the solutions in force in the Third Reich, where the law also did not allow the unpunished murder of any child – “only” of some children (sic).
2571	13	2. Does anyone have the right to possess another person? No. I strongly deny that disapproval.
2571	15	In particular, do I think that anyone has the right to have a child, and consequently to produce it in vitro method? No, nothing like that. In the “Eugenika – in the name of progress” I tried to insist that the moment of selection inevitably occurring in the “in vitro” procedure makes the whole process criminal, and advertising it – especially perfide and uncomfortable. By the way, it is worth noting that the legal acceptance of the “in vitro” practice takes logical grounds for the opposition to abortion – since if we agree to the selection in this exact phase of life, on what basis should we question the right to conduct the same selection in other phases? And maybe just in this – maybe beyond the obvious interests of the “in vitro” industry, its promoters are also concerned: about the introduction of legal permission for abortion somehow “to the kitchen door”?
2571	17	3. Do you think that marriage and family should be protected? Oh yeah yeah. I believe that the relationship to life, marriage and family is at all one of the main criteria of value, legality and effectiveness of every legal system, every state, every civilization. Note bene: For this reason I question the legitimacy of the current Warsaw government (which to avoid possible misunderstandings I do not call Polish). This government, in fact, even initiates further hostile acts against the Polish family – acting against the natural law, struggling with parental authority, creating a guaranteed demand for “in vitro” industry services, implementing the “gender” ideology into the Polish legal system, initiating disinformation and deprivation of minors through state educational force, etc. etc. The state of Warsaw (which I do not call Polish) implementes the strategy of perfid aggression aimed at the family – also when it promotes legal acts of the kind of “anti-violence convention”, whose authors from the traditional family want to make the main suspect and guilty of all pathologies (which makes it not only contrary to nature, but also contrary to any real, statistically recognizable reality of social life in Poland).
2571	19	Do you allow marriage to be a relationship other than the relationship of a man and a woman? No, I do not allow. As a normal Polish, I reject any arbitrary, absurd, ideologically motivated and politically executed manipulation with the fields of meaning of any expression. And as a diplomatic Polonist I remind the long tradition of language manipulation for the achievement of propaganda goals by the fighting with our civilization regimes – the modification, and sometimes even the reversal of the meaning of the words is the essence of every totalitarian “novation”.
2571	21	4. Do you think that you can compulsively educate children contrary to the values confessed by parents? In particular, can the state school encourage the solution, promote exhausted sexual relationships, promote insurance and encourage abortion? It is possible, because this is exactly what they do. I, in principle, condemn this state of things and very pleased to criticize it. Some of you know my critical attitude to state, statized, centralized, compulsory education. For years I have been trying not to ignore the opportunity to criticize the Kallutayev-Stalin teaching system that works with us. In this context, it is obvious that I have a radically negligent attitude to any theories and practices of education that question parental authority. Note bene: the fact described in the historiography is the particular emphasis that the Masonic logos put on the principle of state education – the researchers are known even though the proclamations and directives of the French Masonery XIX/XX above are periodically taught on this matter. Just because without the state's force the rest of the principles of those fighting with the Catholic and Polish tradition organizations could not be so effectively transmitted and implemented.
2571	23	Each of the above issues deserves, of course, a more serious discussion and requires a broader argument – which I leave here, understanding that you do not have any arguments, but you want to know clearly my position in these matters. I hope I don’t leave this field for fundamental doubts. However, if they are overwhelmed, I will serve further explanations. First of all, I ask you to note that, beyond my own understanding, I would like to rely above all on the Traditional teaching of the Catholic Church, and that is the context in which all my observations should be interpreted.
2571	25	Finally, I ask you to accept my most sincere thanks for your commitment, for your courageous appearance in Polish public life – with the wishes that the matters you are dealing with finally find successful conclusions. What will we not be able to do if the law in the Republic of Poland will continue to be established by people who neglect human life, and God is not afraid – with the passive co-production of much more “liberals of compromise.” This is a card of shame, which in the face of the approaching 1050th anniversary of the Baptism of Poland is time to finally turn.
2577	1	Abortion is permissible until 12th week
2577	3	I can’t imagine that my colleagues and colleagues from the party have abandoned the thing they’ve made so much effort. Donald Tusk was skeptical, but he saw the scale of women’s protests and took the position prepared by the Platform members, says Barbara Nowack.
2577	5	Are you winning elections and what happens to abortion?
2577	7	The law must be liberalized. The draft laws are ready.
2577	9	Is the Civil Coalition coherent? It does not seem.
2577	11	is. But the change of law itself is not enough: it is necessary to introduce sexual education, available contraception and a social campaign showing the truth.
2577	13	The truth?
2577	15	Yes. Some voters are opposed to the change because it has been subjected to propaganda for years. We need to show what abortion prohibition is and what liberalization means.
2577	17	What is the truth about liberalization?
2577	19	Every woman can stop pregnancy until the 12th week.
2577	21	Is this going to calm the voters?
2577	23	It is worth noting them that these elections are still going on, only in the grey zone. We need to show what drama the law leads to. If we don’t show this, the idea of power may come again to shake the slope.
2577	25	They are talking about ready-made projects. Which?
2577	27	It is a project to save women.
2577	29	He was. As a citizen who fell in the seam.
2577	31	I made it as a civil initiative. It has gone, but it exists physically. It is complete - it contains issues of sexual education and the availability of contraception, there are solutions that regulate the clause of conscience. This is what it proposes in the framework of the Women’s Pact.
2577	33	Do you want to prohibit the clauses?
2577	35	This is the law of doctors. But it is necessary to take into account the law of patients: they need to know who they are going to. Today they don’t know and it’s a lottery. What translates not only to the issue of abortion, but also access to contraception.
2577	37	In the light of the judgment of the Constitutional Court on an abortion law, is this draft unconstitutional?
2577	39	It is neither a court nor a judgment. The authority which issued it cannot create the law and make its interpretation. It is burdened by the original sin, which means that it can be considered unfaithful.
2577	41	The first step that I would like to take would be the change in the TK?
2577	43	There should be a big reform. We need transitional regulations so that we do not interfere with the system. But yes, this is the concept, the specialists work on it. And then de facto from the automate we will return to the reality in which the previous rules apply, including those on abortion.
2577	45	You haven’t won the election yet, so it’s hard to talk about the chances of your project. But you are in the Sejm, and the issue of abortion rather than being liberalized has been sharpened. What now?
2577	47	What you can do without violating the pseudo-determination of TK, is to remove the record of the punishment of the doctors. The most important thing is to take a prenatal test. You should not be afraid of abortion because of the mental well-being of a woman. Not to be afraid to make decisions to save women.
2577	49	What if the SN addresses the issue of mental well-being in the context of abortion, and considers that it is not a prerequisite in accordance with the law?
2577	51	We have no chance to resist this with the current authority. The active judge of Zebra will judge, and everything will be accepted by the seam majority.
2577	53	Is abortion a political issue to win?
2577	55	This is not a political matter, but a social.
2577	57	It became political. The politicians have to decide what they are paying for.
2577	59	It is paid to lead to a situation in which women are safe. And this can be guaranteed by giving them the right to decide how much, with whom and when they will have children.
2577	61	Is it paid? Or what?
2577	63	I can’t talk about fundamental matters for women’s life and health in terms of support columns.
2577	65	You are a politician.
2577	67	If I was a PSS politician, I would not wonder if it is worth putting restrictions on non-vaccinated people. This is not a matter of political calculation, but a necessity. Saying that the party must look at the surveys, as an explanation...
2577	69	But who is doing so. Marseille Kidawa-Blonsk said this month that abortion is evil. And Tusk was convinced that the compromise would be a problem for the Platform.
2577	71	The election will not win on the issue of abortion. But you can lose them when the Poles will die because they had no access to the procedure.
2577	73	Or when they go to the other side and say they can have an abortion on their desire?
2577	75	There is no such thing as an abortion on desire, only a woman’s decision: easier, difficult or very difficult.
2577	77	Maybe politicians who are afraid that society is conservative and lose talking about abortion open?
2577	79	It is no longer so conservative. Women are changing, and the climate in small towns is changing. This was seen after the protests.
2577	81	However, he has to continue to discuss what his political line in this matter is.
2577	83	No! All four parties agree that by the 12th week abortion should be permissible. Po and Modern are under an additional condition, i.e. consultation with a psychologist. We will talk about the details.
2577	85	You can talk long. How do you know who changes the law?
2577	87	I see that many of our members, after the judgment of TK, changed their attitude. There is also a social change, a giant shift towards pro choice – more and more people are for the liberalization of law. The politicians, even those conservative, are influenced by their wives and daughters, who are more aware that this is their lives. The party has also changed.
2577	89	If anyone wins, will it be a change?
2577	91	I can’t imagine that my colleagues and colleagues from the party have abandoned the thing they’ve made so much effort. Donald Tusk was skeptical at first. But he saw the scale of women’s protests and took the position prepared by members of the Platform. We can cooperate with Lew. On the other hand, there is a big sign of questioning, as regards PSL and Poland 2050 Simeon Hołowni. They will be difficult partners.
2577	93	Do you think nothing will change in this term?
2577	95	About abortion? No. Members of the United Nations Right are on the short slide of Kaczynski. In this context, it is extremely interesting to announce the vote on the civil project “Stop abortion”, which says, among others. 25 years in prison for abortion. Also for women. Ryszard Terlecki said at the conference that they will reject the project in the first reading. He added that there will be no discipline. So we’ll see how many politicians are able to express their own opinion.
2577	97	That is, to say precisely: the ruling majority may vote for a proposal to reject the project in the first reading, which will...
2577	99	The civil coalition, the left.
2577	101	The civil project that strengthened the law has reached the Sejm, and on the other hand the civil project “Legal abortion without compromises” is still without the required 100 thousand. the signatures.
2577	103	Ask the committee that will collect them.
2577	105	But she was engaged in the twin project, “Let’s save women.”
2577	107	I’ve been the chairman of this committee twice and twice there was no problem with the collection of signatures. I don’t hide that it’s hard work. The one you ask is about politicians of the Lewica and women’s organizations, and the Initiative of Poland (which presides Nowacka – red.) She was not invited. The strike puts the woman on the left. We are supporting, for example. In my office, you can sign it.
2577	109	Is it your diplomatic answer to the question of the lack of unity of the opposition or the left-wing environment on the topic of abortion?
2577	111	When I gathered the signatures under “Rescue Women”, there was no political unity. I have invited everyone to this initiative because I think it’s a matter and not a party shild. I can’t say why this strategy was adopted around ‘Legal Abortion’. Why did not the signatures be collected during the last demonstrations? Why did we not talk about this? The fact that when we gathered signatures in 2016 and 2017 there was no pandemic, the social atmosphere was recorded. This allowed us to believe that it will succeed. also to avoid changes. We are also fighting against attempts to increase the punishment for abortion. And then it managed.
2577	113	And today? After the trial and after the events in the district hospital, the atmosphere is not hot?
2577	115	Today we have an atmosphere of disappointment. We come out not with the offensive motto of liberalization of law, but with the dramatic appeal: “#No More”. It is also true that the drafting of projects in today’s Sema has no sense, because PiS has the argument for the aforementioned judgment of the pseudotribunal. And he will say that: we will reject the project because it is incompatible with the Constitution.
2577	117	During the collection of signatures under “Rescue Women” was there another seam arithmetic?
2577	119	It was equally difficult. But then, in addition to collecting signatures, we did a giant social campaign showing the truth, that is: how the abortion law looks, what means access to safe, legal abortion, how important is sexual education and effective contraception. And also in what situation are the women who go to the doctor, and in the office they hear that there is a clause of conscience.
2577	121	You are for the removal of art. 152 of the Criminal Code, which speaks of punishment for performing or helping in abortion?
2577	123	In this M.in. It is located in the so-called The Rescue Act. It is about abortion dependency.
2577	125	Today, this article comes from accusations against women’s organizations.
2577	127	These actors help in crisis situations when the state is systematically turning away from women. Everything will be read as a help. If a girl comes to me on the street and I give her a number to the borderless abortion, then will I have to wait for accusations too? Assistance in making an abortion decision, in informing about possible routes should not be punishable.
2577	129	And the doctors? How do you evaluate your attitude today? They say they are afraid of prosecutors. We hear accusations of handwashing.
2577	131	You can’t blame them for fanatics rule the country. Their fear is not unfounded. Therefore, our idea for the present situation is to provide the doctors with a sense of safety.
2577	133	How?
2577	135	We will start a meeting with local governors. We want to use their good practices, for example. Warsaw and the decision of the president of the city immediately after the TK judgment – that the hospitals operate so that they don’t hide by a clause of conscience. It is also necessary to provide legal assistance to doctors. From the scope of the interpretation of the current legislation, as well as in emergencies, it is also a task for the municipal authorities.
2578	1	Is abortion a human law or is it not? Not in this matter
2578	3	It does not matter whether the right to abortion is considered a fundamental law or not. It is important that the prohibition or limitation of this right may constitute a violation of the rights of the woman.
2578	5	I worked at the Office of the European Court of Human Rights. I have conducted three Polish matters, assigned to me by wage, relating to the relationship between the 1993 Law on Family Planning, the Protection of the Human Fertile and the Conditions of Admissibility for Abortion and the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms – which is a part of the Polish legal order since 1993. 
2578	7	These were three cases: the complaint of Alicya Thousand, the complaint of R.R. The court ruled that Poland’s authorities violated the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The right to respect for private life has been violated, and in the case of P. i. S. the prohibition of non-human treatment is also violated. For the purposes of these matters, I ate professional teeth to study the consequences which the prohibition or restriction of access to legal abortion has for human rights – in the dimension of national law, in the perspective of legal comparison and international law.
2578	9	Therefore, with some irritation, I am reading today some legal enunciations about abortion – because of the unrighteousness of the authors, the superficiality of their texts or the hard idealization of the topic, resistant to the rules of the law, and often also to the facts. Example from the last days: an interview with my talented colleague, the messenger Thomas Snarsky, published by the Catholic Information Agency. I understand that KAI, like a canyon, needs expert legitimation for the content published by it on the legal aspects of abortion. I have a big problem with what the game is. Snarski speaks as an expert.
2578	11	Human Rights of the Woman
2578	13	By applying the trick consisting of the foolish statement as the fact that “abortion is not a human law”, he manages to ignore – or to distract the reader’s attention from that – that the legal admissibility of abortion shapes and affects the human rights the subject of which is the woman. 
2578	15	We read in the interview that “when it comes to ensuring state protection for women who may find themselves in a situation of the need to terminate pregnancy, there is no need to refer to human rights.” We do not find in the words of Snarsky any information about the relationship that occurs between the way the law defines the permission of abortion and the human rights belonging to the woman. As if this relationship did not exist, and the right to terminate pregnancy was, as Snarski says, a gracious “exception” or “blindness” of the legislator. (The remarkable presentation of the right to terminate pregnancy in this way is unbeatly parental, and from a comparative perspective inaccurate; for example, in Canada after the abolition by the Supreme Court in 1988 the law criminalizing terminate pregnancy due to its unconstitutional nature has not been adopted any legal act at the federal level or in the individual provinces that determined the conditions for the admissibility of abortion).
2578	17	It’s not about whether a legal termination of pregnancy is a human law or not. The fact is that to assess the way the law regulates the issue of access to legal abortion (as well as other medical benefits in the field of reproductive health), the fundamental right to respect the private life of a woman is applied. This law is guaranteed to every person. Article 8 of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 7 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights – that I will mention only the most important acts of national or international law. It should also not be forgotten that respect for privacy and protection against state interference have been part of the European and Anglo-Saxon legal tradition for centuries.
2578	19	So Thomas Snarski – or the journalist asking him – makes the task easier. It does not try to answer the question, what is the relationship between the law guaranteed respect for the private life of a woman and the competitive law that could benefit the fetus.  
2578	21	In 2018, the then civil rights spokesman Adam Bodnar said in the context of the works on the two civil projects, which in the intention of the authors were to change the law on the conditions of permission of abortion, that “abortion is not a human law.” However, these conditions are defined by the national legislation, as international law does not guarantee the right to abortion directly. And not that the issue of abortion is indifferent to women’s human rights – as now the match claims. Snarski.
2578	23	This is known by the European Court of Human Rights judgment. He noted long ago that the legislation regulating abortion affects the sphere of private life, because whenever a woman is pregnant, her private life becomes closely linked to the growing fetus. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (guarding the right to respect for the private life) cannot, according to the court, be interpreted as granting the right to abortion, but the facts arising from the existence of prohibition or restrictions of access shall be assessed as to whether the right of a woman to respect for her private life has not been violated as a result of those prohibitions.
2578	25	Therefore, it does not matter whether the right to abortion is considered a fundamental law or not. It is important that the prohibition or limitation of this right may constitute a violation of the rights of the woman. This information will not be found in the interview.
2578	27	“The principle of proportionality has not been adopted.”
2578	29	It is called “attending certain values.” Meanwhile, we are dealing with a classic and often encountered in the practice of establishing and applying the law the situation of competition worthy of protection of goods/values/rights. 
2578	31	The law has long known the tools for solving such conflicts. According to the Polish law, the instrument is art. Article 31 of the Constitution. “The restrictions on the use of constitutional freedoms and rights can only be established by law and only when they are necessary in a democratic state for its security or public order, or for the protection of the environment, health and public morality, or for the freedoms and rights of others.” The principle of proportionality expressed in it, among other things, is reflected both in Article 32 of the European Charter of Human Rights and in the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.  
2578	33	A lawyer who respects the rule of law should not lose this rule out of the eye – as an instrument for resolving the conflict of goods/interests deserved to be protected; as an instrument for achieving a fair balance between such goods. It is also applicable when it applies to a woman in unwanted pregnancy, pregnant with poor health assessments for the woman and/or the fetus itself. At least I would mention it. This principle of proportionality came to light to national legislators when in the second half of the 20th century they introduced laws in Europe and in the world legalizing abortion as a medical service.
2578	35	Not without the corner, constitutionists or human rights specialists sometimes say sadly that “the principle of proportionality has not been accepted in Poland” as a professional instrument of subtle and accurate competitive assessment, and worthy of protection of goods and interests; as a instrument of pursuit of fair settlement; as a judicial rejection of persons who make and enforce the law. Presented by the match. Snarsky – that before the right to the life of the fetus must always and in every situation withdraw any other law of the woman – is the expression of this just negligence of the principle of proportionality. The radical nature of this position lies in the fact that it treats the fetus as a man, and the breakdown of pregnancy as a removal of man’s life. However, we don’t know what specifically – in the matter of determining the legal permission of abortion – should be the advocate’s proposed “seeking optimal solutions in unoptimal conditions”. We are also not aware that the law can differentiate – and so does – the scope of the legal protection of the fetus depending on the stage of the development of pregnancy. 
2578	37	And when it comes to these values and interests, it is not possible to not see that in the text dedicated – among other things – to the issue of legal regulation of abortion does not fall a single view of what worthy protection of the legal value and interests of women speak for that abortion is a available and legal medical service. Of course, we have a journalist’s suggestion that such a good could be “a woman’s unlimited freedom” on which match. Snarski responds with some disgrace that there is nothing like unlimited freedom – and rightly. 
2578	39	So much that in addition to “unlimited freedom” there are also other interests and goods of women, which the prohibition of abortion can violate or destroy. For example, personal autonomy. For example, seeking to shape your own fate in the intended way. For example, the sense of responsibility for the fate of children that already exists. For example, the consciousness that the birth of a sick child – statistically a matter – results in Poland by about 80 percent. Men leave the family. But who would be concerned about such fanabers? It’s easier to simply call them “unlimited freedom”. 
2578	41	Is the fetus subject to the same legal protection as the human being? 
2578	43	Therefore, we do not find in the text information that the legal regulation of abortion has a direct impact on whether the rights of women are respected and respected. We can read that “from the perspective that I have divided the concept of human rights, the right to abortion is simply incomprehensible. It is difficult to explain how someone would have a right to this, understood as a human law. Because the consequence would be that the fetus, that is, the man before birth, is not a separate person.” We continue to read about the rights of “innocents, unprotected people, such as unborn children.”
2578	45	The Mec. Snarski thus blurred smoothly over the issue of the status of the fetus, treating it as a “man before birth.” In a legal sense, it was obvious. For the purposes of this text there is no clear need or possibility to refer to the extensive legal and philosophical literature on whether the fetus is a man in the sense that it deserves the same scope of protection as after birth. This issue has been and remains the subject of serious debates and controversies. It would be elegant even to mention this, instead of presenting the matter as if the opinion of the speaker – to whom it is clear – was identical with the conclusion of this debate. Because it is simply not so. 
2578	47	"In Polish legal literature there is, however, a fundamental work – awarded by the edition of the prestigious publication “State and Law” for the best doctorate – on the definition of the beginnings of human life, the differences in this matter between the different systems of law and the differences in the same international law. Dr. Jelena Kondratieva-Bryzik (worked at the Center for Human Rights of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Poznań, died in 2012 in a railway disaster under Szczekocinami) published a matter under the title ""The beginning of the legal protection of human life in the light of international standards"" in 2009. The author presented a careful legal comparative analysis of the way different international law acts and educated on them jurisprudence define this moment. These definitions are very diverse and cannot be brought to the simple conclusion that the fetus is simply a person who, for this reason, has the same legal protection before and after birth."
2578	49	It would not be necessary to remember the European Court of Human Rights’s position in this regard. “There is no consensus on the nature and status of the embryo and/or fetus (...), although they begin to receive some protection in the light of scientific progress and the potential consequences of research on genetic engineering, medical supported procreation or embryonic experiments. In the best case, it can be considered a common level of the agreement between States that the embryos/fertiles belong to the human species. The potential of this entity and its ability to become a person – which, in addition, benefits from the protection of civil law in many countries, such as France, in the context of heritage and donations, as well as in the United Kingdom (...) – requires protection in the name of human dignity, without making it “persons” having “right to live” in the meaning of Article 2 [European Convention on Human Rights].” Having regard to the above, the Court is convinced that it is neither desirable nor even possible in the present state of things to give an abstract answer to the question whether the unborn child is a person within the meaning of the article. 2 of the Convention [which guarantees the right to legal protection of life].”
2578	51	It would be worth considering this before the court still formulates the status of the legal fruit as categorical as it does the match. Snarski, and in addition – a court, which in the context of the interview can be taken as an expert, legal claim on the facts. For legal professionals, the ability to distinguish between facts and judgments/evaluations belongs to the basic professional instrument. I have no doubt that the match. Snarski has this skill, which his professional achievements are convincing evidence. The faithfulness of the position he presented would gain if he avoided that impotence. 
2578	53	This will not lead to an important professional success. of Snarsky. He represented the families of the Smolensk disaster victims before the European Court of Human Rights. The subject of the complaint was the allegation of violation of the right to respect for private and family life as a result of the exhumation of the remains of the victims against family opposition. The Strasbourg Court ruled that this exhumation was such a violation. As the Convention does not directly guarantee “the right to abortion”, so does not guarantee “the right not to exhumate the bodies of close persons without the consent of the family.” But both one and the other are equally assessed: whether it was in accordance with human rights.  
2578	55	The “natural human dignity” is no longer enough.
2578	57	I do my last attention with real regret. I have no doubt about Dr. Snarsky’s genuine commitment to the idea of protecting human rights. However, the interview contains some significant omission. I think it has the value of ethical abandonment.  
2578	59	It is not possible today in Poland to talk about the legal permission of termination of pregnancy, getting water into the mouth as to what consequences the prohibition of termination of pregnancy caused by the pathology of the fetus. There are already two stories of young pregnant women who died in hospitals after the court of Julia Przyłębskaya removed the embryopathological pattern from the 1993 law. I expect from the lawyers – and I consider it an important element of the professionalism, often otherwise absent in the Polish law, often sinning with theoretical beauty – the desire and the ability to reflect on what social consequences the applicable law has.  
2578	61	I expect from human rights lawyers that they want and know how to see the real consequences of the applicable legal norms for the real life of people. That they do not content themselves with shooting acts to the “natural human dignity”, which in the face of the threat of the present situation of Polish women sounds like a blurry. 
2579	1	Why should abortion be morally neutral?
2579	3	The text “I hope, but I’d never make an abortion” emphasizes that abortion is something bad, something to avoid, something to be as little as possible. What do you really want to say when you say that opinion? Is it not a matter of protecting yourself from the judgment of others?“”
2579	5	The struggle for the pro-choice environment – because the calling of their pro-choice has long been unactualized – for the legalization of abortion quickly passed from the stage “no one says abortion is not good” to the stage “no one says abortion is bad.” Now they are forced to abstain from the moral assessments of abortion, regardless of what was its cause and at what moment the pregnancy was done. It must be morally neutral, even if the pregnancy is already so advanced that the child is able to live independently outside the mother’s body. For it is continuously a fruit and the right to speak of it as of the farce, the progressive left will defend it as of independence.
2579	7	The representatives of the Abortion Dream Team write that “abortion is one of the methods of control of fertility, as important as contraception and there is no reason for politicians, medicine or market to impose us the best way to protect against unwanted pregnancy.” And people who support the right to abortion under certain circumstances, but have the courage to claim that they do not submit abortion themselves, are given the right to recognize themselves as the supporters of the choice. Because today pro-choice is no longer a struggle for the right to abortion. It is a struggle for the prohibition of moral appreciation. This is just a contraception, as morally neutral as a preservative. In this way, abortion lobbyists confirm exactly what they were – seemingly harmful – criticized for. Abortion is like a cut nail. And it is not about changing the law, it is about continuous inclination of those who think differently. Good that we have clarity.
2579	9	Do you know how in America the taboo was broken, what was smoking by women in public places? The advertising agency for cigarette producers organized a “spontaneous” women’s march on Easter of Freedom in 1929. The proud passed the Fifth Avenue in New York, convinced by desirable millionaires that they are fighting for their freedom when they actually fought for (and fought) to multiply the profits of tobacco corporations. For themselves they only fought that today lung cancer is the second after breast cancer malignant cancer in women. I’m wondering if today marketers from pharmaceutical corporations have their part in the downstream movement of belief that abortion is freedom. Women in Falun Gong – a organization that works for the right to abortion in the countries where it is prohibited – for a pregnancy tablet receives 70–90 euros “donative”. This is a potentially giant market if you manage to completely break the taboo.
2583	1	Voice pro-life: religious, philosophical, legal, biological and social arguments against abortion
2583	3	Abortion has been one of the most common human problems for many years. Everyone speaks about it – from religious institutions, by biologists and ethics, to philosophers. Often, however, the opinions expressed lack the argument that can speak to the average citizen. There is nothing out of such empty words. In the following article we will present the reasons why abortion – especially “on request” – should be penetrated. First, some defining issues should be explained. Since there is no medical term that would clearly refer to all stages of the body’s development between birth and childbirth, for the purposes of the following text, consider that in this context we will exchange the terms “fertility” and “unborn child” unless otherwise stated from the record.
2583	5	What is Pro-Life? 
2583	7	The restrictive abortion law is defined by the term pro-life (ang. “for life.” Although in the general opinion they argue for the complete ban of abortion, in reality the environment is not homogeneous. Part of the pro-life movement allows the interruption of pregnancy in specific cases (e.g. When the life of the mother is in danger), others, in turn, even argue against the artificial methods of regulating the beginnings (e.g. Hormonal contraception. Therefore, it is much safer to say that the general goal of this environment is not so much to unlaw abortion as to minimize the frequency of procedures. This can be achieved both by strengthening the law (if the present seems too liberal) and byining the status quo (e.g. if the government is trying to liberalize the existing records). Pro-life does not want to allow the social situation of permission for abortion, which consequently could be transformed into the increasing and uncontrolled shift of the boundaries of deciding about human life or death.
2583	9	Religious authorities are compatible 
2583	11	In Poland, about 94% of citizens are persons of Roman Catholic religion (for GUS “Religious Religions in Poland 2012-2014”). This, of course, does not mean – as some think – that the remaining 6% must blindly subordinate to the morality imposed by the majority. However, as so many of us recognize the teachings of the Church, it is worth learning what the sacred books and people we consider as authorities think about abortion.
2583	13	Decalogue and catechism of the Catholic Church 
2583	15	You don’t need to look far, because Decalog says straightforward: don’t kill. The fifth commandment protects the life of every man from conception to natural death, therefore the position of the Catholics is unchanged and clear – both in the matter of abortion and euthanasia. However, as we know (and at least we should know), biblical records should not always be treated literally. Let us therefore refer to the “Catholic Catholic Church” – an official interpretation of the doctrine of faith and the principles of the Church’s morality, written in a simple, understandable language and published in 1992. This is, therefore, a relatively new document and approved by the then Pope John Paul II. The previously mentioned fifth commandment of the Decalogu is developed here in approximately 80 points, but we are interested in only six of them: the points from 2270 to 2275 concern specifically the issues of abortion. So how does “cathechism” refer to this issue? In the 2270 point we get a clear and exhaustive answer:
2583	17	The human life from the moment of conception should be respected and protected in an absolute way. From the first moment of its existence, the human being must have given the rights of the person, among them the irreversible right of every innocent being to live.
2583	19	Further points develop this thesis: The Church has from the beginning claimed that it is a moral evil any disruption caused by pregnancy. The teaching on this subject has not changed and remains unchanged. The direct termination of pregnancy, i.e. intended as a purpose or means, is deeply contrary to the moral law (2271). “Catechism” is called here. On “Didache”, one of the oldest Christian texts: You will not kill the fetus by interrupting pregnancy or kill a newborn (Didache 2,2).
2583	21	Formal interaction in terminating pregnancy is a serious violation. The Church imposes the canonical punishment of excommunications for this crime against human life. Whoever causes interruption of pregnancy, after the occurrence of effect, is subject to an excommunication binding by the law itself, by the fact of committing the offence itself, under the conditions stipulated by the law (2272). The indispensable right to life of any innocent human being is the constitutional element of civil society and its legislation: The indispensable rights of a person must be recognized and respected by civil society and political authority. Among these fundamental rights must be mentioned the right to life and physical integrity of every human being from the moment of conception to death. As an expression of respect and care for the child who has to be born, from the moment of his birth, the legislation should provide appropriate penal penalties for any voluntary violation of his rights (2273). Some indigenous critics of abortion law argue that the Roman Catholic doctrine does not allow absolutely any intervention during pregnancy, including, among other things. The prenatal test. This is, of course, a credible fool, about which the last two points speak: Since the embryos should be considered a person from the moment of conception, it should be defended its integrity, cared for it and treated as far as possible as any other human being. Prenatal diagnosis is morally permissible if it “reserves the life and integrity of the human embryo and fetus, seeks to protect it or to treat it individually (...) it opposes the moral law when, depending on the results, it leads to the interruption of pregnancy. Diagnosis should not lead to death sentence (2274). Like any medical treatment on a patient, treatment on a human embryo should be considered acceptable, provided that it respects the life and integrity of the embryo, without exposing it to risks disproportionately large; when it is taken for the purpose of healing, improving his health or to save a life in danger (2275).
2583	23	So what are the conclusions from the reading “The Catholic Church’s Catholicism”?  Human life is protected from the moment of conception, abortion is undoubtedly evil and immoral, prenatal tests and embryonic treatments are as permitted as far as possible, unless they threaten the life of the mother and child.
2583	25	Mother Teresa and John Paul II 
2583	27	Mother Teresa of Calcutta, one of the most influential figures in the history of world peace, has also been very critical about the abortion. In 1979, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded, saying that abortion is the greatest threat to peace today. If a mother is allowed to kill her own child, what can prevent you and me from killing each other? Unborn children are the poorest of the poorest. Let’s go back to John Paul II. Three years after the approval of the “Catholic Catholic Church” the Pope announced the “Evangelium Vitae”, an encyclical on the values and inviolability of human life. He condemned abortion as a cruel crime.
2583	29	All kinds of murder, genocide, fertilization, euthanasia, and voluntary suicide... all these and similar affairs and practices are something shameful; infecting the human civilization more with the shame of those who accept them than those who suffer harm, and are as opposed to the worthy honor of the Creator.
2583	31	John Paul II also stated that, in the case of an internally unjust law, which is the law allowing the cessation of pregnancy and euthanasia, it is never permitted to be applied “not to participate in the formation of a public opinion favorable to such a law, nor to demonstrate its support in the vote.” It is worth noting that many Catholics treat the teachings of the Church very selectively, treating them as an excuse only in strictly defined matters. This is not the true faith. By rejecting the opinion of religious authorities only when it fits our beliefs, we dismiss the idea of religion. The position of the Church is and has always been clear: abortion is absolute and absolute evil.
2583	33	Abortion in other religions 
2583	35	And what about the remaining six percent that this interpretation does not apply? Other religions are also critical to abortion. 
2583	37	Different breaks of Christianity 
2583	39	Orthodoxy, like Catholicism, shares the view that human life begins at the time of conception. Abortion is considered murder. There are many Protestants, mostly Orthodox. The largest Protestant Church in Poland, the Evangelical-Augsburg Church in the Republic of Poland, in a declaration of 1991 strongly advocated the protection of life from the moment of conception and opposed the use of contraceptive measures. Abortion is also opposed by the churches united in the Evangelical Alliance. The unconditional opponent of abortion is the Southern Baptist Convention. 
2583	41	Jehovah’s Witnesses say that God considers life as holy. The embryos are seen as a separate human being. King David was inspired by writing about God: “Your eyes have seen even my embryos” (Psalm 139:16). In his time, God declared that whoever hurt the unborn child will be brought to responsibility. So, in the eyes of God, killing such a child is a murder (Exodus 20:13; 21:22, 23).
2583	43	Buddhism 
2583	45	Although Buddhism has no official interpretation of abortion, many monastery codes – referring to traditional writings – recognize the moment of conception as the beginning of human life. Therefore, abortion, as a conscious destruction of this life, is treated as something bad. Therawads and men who are deceived for help in abortion are excluded from the law. A negative view of abortion is also stated by the present Dalai Lama, saying it is a murder act, so according to the science it should be penetrated. It is also worth mentioning that the traditional Buddhist writings do not note differences in the approach to early and late abortion – each case is linked to negative moral or karmic consequences.
2583	47	Hinduism 
2583	49	Traditional Hindu texts condemn abortion. This crime is treated, depending on the sources, equal to the breakdown of the marriage of purity (Mahanarayan Upanisada), as worse than the murder of his own parents (Kauszitaki Upanisada), and even equal to the murder of the priest – bramin (which in Hinduism is one of the heavest crimes, if not the heavest). A woman who has undergone an abortion is at risk of losing her status. The abortion itself is called bhrūṇahatya (feed murder), and the person who committed it is bhrūṇahan (the murderer of the taught bramin). In Hinduism, life begins from the moment of conception. Abortion, therefore, causes the death of a man, and this coincides with the primary principle of faith, ahima (the term literally means “no harm”).
2583	51	Religions say ‘No’ to abortion
2583	53	The majority of significant religions therefore have a clear and negative position on abortion. The human life begins at the moment of conception, so any intervention that causes the death of the embryos or fetus is in one way or another enlightened. It is worth noting that in most cases the murder of an unborn child is treated at least equally – and sometimes even as a harder crime – than the murder of a born person. Of course, what has already been marked before, we should absolutely not impose on others the morality that arises from our religion, but if we confess a given faith, we should live according to its guidelines – and those about abortion are usually clear.
2583	55	and II. The law protects the fruit. 
2583	57	The issue of abortion is not overseas regulated by EU law, so it remains in the management of the Member States. 
2583	59	Constitution of RP 
2583	61	In the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of April 2, 1997 we read: The Republic of Poland provides to every person a legal protection of life (art. All are equal in respect of the law (Art. 32 of them. 1 ) It remains, therefore, to define the moment in which man is formed. The Constitution does not answer this question (especially because it is a general act), but the Constitutional Court – and so on. In Decision of 28 May 1997 (Signature K 26/96) we read:
2583	63	The value of the constitutionally protected legal good which is human life, including life developing in the prenatal phase, cannot be differentiated. There are, in fact, a lack of sufficiently accurate and justified criteria to make such a differentiation depending on the developmental phase of human life. Since the time of existence, human life has become a constitutionally protected value. This also applies to the prenatal phase.
2583	65	This position was alsoined seven years later (Decision of 7 January 2004, Signature K 14/03): Any possible doubts regarding the protection of human life should be resolved in favour of this protection (in dubio pro vita humana). This means that human life – a clear analogue to religious interpretations can be observed – begins at the moment of conception, and if it is not known whether the given action (here: abortion) interferes in protecting that life, it should be assumed that it is so.
2583	67	Convention on the Rights of the Child 
2583	69	And if the Polish interpretation – according to the pro-choice environments contaminated by Catholic thought – is too little, let’s get to a much broader territorial document: the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This agreement was ratified by Poland in 1991, and moreover, it was Poland that proposed its approval to the UN Human Rights Commission and submitted a draft. The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, adopted in 1959, states that the child, due to his physical and mental impairment, requires special care and care, including adequate legal protection, both before and after birth. The last paragraph is so important that it also gives the mentioned rights to the child in the mother's womb. The convention does not specify the time when the child begins. Again, therefore, we can refer to the principle in dubio pro vita humana – the record of legal protection before birth is a condition sufficient to consider that the body is subject to this protection from the moment of conception, and not the imaginary point on the axis of time.
2583	71	and III. Uncertain position of biologists 
2583	73	The biological point of view has one fundamental disadvantage: even abortion supporters admit that it is impossible to clearly determine at what point of development we are dealing with man. They thus approach such abstract concepts as the unification of humanity with consciousness, with independence from the mother’s body, with the feeling of pain, or simply determine a certain arbitrary age of the fetus, after which we have the fullness of rights to life, and before it is passed, no rights. This kind of argument is not only ridiculous, but even ignorantly selective – which will be wider in the point dedicated to philosophical issues. Let’s leave this thesis for a moment without evidence. Let us turn off emotions, turn into thinking, and do it rationally. In a certain simplification, we can recognize – regardless of our views on the issue of abortion – that every living being is a collection of genes and it is a very strictly defined collection. For the purposes of simplification, for example. It has 46 chromosomes – 23 from the father and 23 from the mother. Since human reproductive cells can only get into contact with other human reproductive cells (although ambitious trials scientists failed to lead to fertilization even the closest biologically related Homo sapiens), it is obvious that the body was formed as a result of the interaction of male and female human gamet and having 46 chromosomes is man. The 80-year-old has 46 chromosomes. The 18-year-old has 46 chromosomes. The baby has 46 chromosomes. The three-month fetus has 46 chromosomes. So the question is: how many chromosomes has a newborn embryos? The answer, of course, we all know. It is 46 of them – already at the time of joining the zygota has a full set of chromosomes. At the level of DNA, even the embryos – and the more embryos and fetuses – are formations that are equal to the adult individual. If the murder of the latter is evil, why is the murder of his former form justified? Scientific, not emotional, approach to biology therefore confirms both religious and legal arguments. We become a de facto man at the time of birth. Not after birth, not as a fetus, not as an embryo, but after fertilization. Therefore, in the light of the applicable law, we need the same protection as an adult. Another pro-choice argument attracted by the environment is as if the fetus or embryos were an integral part of the mother's body, because it develops inside it and is connected with it by a puppy. You cannot be far from the truth. The child is an absolutely separate being – it has separate organs (when they are produced), often a different blood group, and above all – and here we return to the scientific essence of mankind – a different genetic code. Two different DNA codes always give two separate organisms. It is even more absurd to refer to the “existencial dependence of the fetus on the mother” and the symbiotic bond. Existencially dependent can be a weak Siam twin. Does this give the stronger twin – like the one who “matches” – the right to decide the fate of the weaker? So why do I let my mother do that?
2583	75	and IV. More and less people tend to abortion 
2583	77	Since the introduction of the 1993 law, the Poles’ attitudes have become more and more conservative. In 2006, for the first time, the advance of abortion opponents over supporters was. In 2009, one in three Poles allowed the possibility of terminating pregnancy. Four years later, only every four. The trend of abortion on demand from year to year is increasingly visible.
2583	79	The CBOS Communication “The Admissibility of Abortion in Different Situations” of May 2016 clearly indicates that the Poles are against the killing of unborn children. Up to 65% of respondents believe that childhood is not an argument to allow abortion. Only one in five Poles has a different opinion. Even less social permission runs for abortion due to a difficult personal situation (80% against) or material (81% against).
2583	81	Interestingly, the income per person in the household does not significantly differentiate the views on abortion due to the poor material situation. People with a maximum income of €649 per capita are in 80% against abortion in such a case, and people with a income of €1000-1399 - in 84%. This is a lie to say that the greatest opposition is expressed by those to whom this situation cannot directly affect. Low-income studies are also negative on abortion among people with similar property status. According to the Communication: In the face of the admissibility of abortion in a situation where a woman simply does not want to have a child, 54% of people are definitely opposed. In total, 12% of Poles say abortion should be acceptable, and 78% are opposed. Similarly, opinions about abortion are disseminated after 12 weeks of pregnancy (without indicating the reason). Three-quarters of the respondents (74%) believe abortion should not be acceptable, and 13% are willing to accept it.
2583	83	It is clear that with the course of the years the Polish society has grown up and gained awareness. The number of abortion opponents is increasing. In general, this is a moral phenomenon, which has no public permission. We live in a democratic country, and this implies two important matters: respect for the decisions taken by the majority (when a decisive majority considers abortion as evil – like any other murder – targeted against another person, it should be reflected in law); respect for the rights of the weak side (in this case, the weak side are unborn children, which must be protected).
2583	85	Social pathologies resulting from abortion 
2583	87	The society is against abortion on demand because it confirms pathological patterns of behavior. Treating a child as a commodity that must be free of condemnation (and the smallest physical or mental disability is already the argument for termination of pregnancy) in the straight line leads to abortion for other reasons – inappropriate gender (in India selective abortion is already a fact), the color of the eyes, the presence of this or other recessive gene. If the unborn child doesn’t fit to our idealized image of the descendant, it’s easier to “prove” them than to have, for example. A red son instead of a blonde daughter. Therefore, it is only a step towards the negative eugenics, the example we had in the first half of the 20th century just under our nose. When we take our unborn child the right to live only because he is born foolish or with the Down syndrome, do we not become, in a sense, continuers of the German Action T4?
2583	89	and VI. Abortion and demographic problems 
2583	91	It is assumed that generations can be replaced when the childhood factor oscillates within the limits of 2.1. In Poland, we have been facing a demographic decline for a long time – and that’s not the lowest. According to the World Factbook, the rate of childhood in Poland in 2015 was only 1.33 – it was 215 outcomes in the world from 224 countries. This means that from generation to generation the population of Poles decreases by one-third. Implications of low infertility are easy to predict and visible now. According to the GUS report “Population Forecast for the years 2014-2050”: Less childhood means less children born, which in turn leads to a decrease in the percentage of young people in the population, resulting in increased social benefits for elderly, worsening the economic situation of young people and, as a result, the maintenance or decrease of low childhood.
2583	93	This phenomenon is called a low childhood trap. It is not necessary to add, of course, that one of the sources of such a state of things is abortion. In 2014, according to a report from the Council of Ministers, 1,000 such procedures were carried out in Poland. Of course, this number applies only to legal cases, which are merely the peak of the ice mountain. Pro-choice movements estimate the scale of abortion underground up to 200 thousand procedures per year. This is more than half of the number of live births in 2014. If this procedure was limited to individual cases, the infertility rate would be close to the value of 2.0.
2583	95	Legalization is a recipe for everything. 
2583	97	You can, of course, raise the voice that it best tastes the forbidden fruit (herever in this statement there is a very perverse joke), and the best way to fight the abortion underground – and therefore with a low natural growth – is... full legalization of abortion. It can be applied to a ban in the United States in the 20s and 30s, which completely disregulated the state. Life is not as simple as some think. Abortion is not, contrary to the belief of certain environments, a first-need treatment. It is luxury. Removing – and again outside the corner looks black humor – the errors of the previous evening, week or month. Many aspects of life are prohibited by law, and yet we have not fallen into ruins. The streets are not full of drunk in the stream of high school students (alcohol is permitted from the age of 18), and on the stairs the heroinists are not well-known. If indeed the source of any evil was the prohibition of doing it, each of us would have a bimbrow, a compound with ammunition and a camper to produce metamfetamine. However, this does not happen. A license to sell alcohol of its own production will not make people stop drinking. Legalization of abortion will not cause the underground to disappear.
2583	99	Does abortion protect against abortion?
2583	101	The myth is also – so pleasantly attracted by the pro-choice environments – the threat of the world’s overflow. The global childhood rate is just 2.42 (see “The World Factbook”). Indeed, in the twentieth century we saw a huge population jump – from 1.6 billion to more than 6 billion – but today this growth is no longer interpretative. It is estimated that in 2100 we will be “only” 11 billion, and therefore only 4 billion more than today. If the living conditions are improved in the poorest regions of the world – mostly in Africa – the ratio should still fall. In fact, 32 of the top 33 countries in the ranking are on this continent – and the latter of them, Madagascar, has the index twice as high as required for generational substitutability. Improving the living conditions would lead to its decrease, as it would be associated with less children’s mortality and the extension of the expected age of survival.
2583	103	and VII. Abortion: Do women have consciousness? 
2583	105	"The monography “The Abortion – Between Ideology and Individual Experience” by Ewelina Wejbert-Wusiewicz (recognized by the Polish Sociological Society as the best scientific book in the field of sociology in 2011) shows that this procedure has a doubtless impact – and that is a negative impact – on the later life of the unacceptable parents. The book presents a summary of the causes of abortion along with the degree resulting from this ""abortion disorder""."
2583	107	It is clear that the vast majority of cases is accompanied by pathological pain – this means that abortion is not indifferent to women and causes rather harder than lighter feelings. On the internet forum aimed at women after abortion, on the basis of which the above table was created, you can see, among other things. I cut my hands out of disappointment and impotence... my child... let me forgive it, I hope I will fix it all... that God will help me... how I could do it...... I killed him... he deserves death... I want to have a child... give him that love... I give life for one chance! The whole situation does not help the fact that in Poland there is a lack of good, professional psychological assistance and gynecological care. Women’s abortion sufferings are therefore even stronger than it could be, whileining the appropriate level of medical services (which does not mean that smaller sufferings justify in some way the procedure for abortion). On the other hand, the monography also cites cases where women did not feel absolutely any guilt for the act done. Abortion for them was a cosmetic treatment, like the peeling of a broken skin. If they were pregnant again, they would lose the life of another fetus.
2583	109	If not abortion, what?
2583	111	The replacement family 
2583	113	The first alternative to abortion is the replacement family. It is said that this is a very difficult, complex and long procedure, but the Pre-Adoptive Intervention Center report (March 2013) shows that up to 97% of subsidiaries have entered the family environment – including more than 91% to substituting and natural families. The average stay in the IOP of the child left by the mother in the hospital is only 61 days. In a situation where every fifth marriage has problems with getting pregnant, the adoption of a child seems to solve several issues at the same time – it reduces the scale of abortion, allows the child to live (which in itself is not guilty of anything) and allows it to be educated to people who for various reasons cannot have biological descendants.
2583	115	The window of life 
2583	117	Mothers who want to deny their own child may be scared of the disclosure of their data. In the hospital you need to sign the appropriate papers and get exposed to the label (in this regard we still tact in the deep Middle Ages) of the natural mother. If there is no adoption, then it is possible. the window of life? The window of life is the place where a mother can anonymously leave the baby – open from the outside, heated, with appropriate ventilation. Its opening starts a signal that informs the dispatch person of the appearance of the child. Then it is enough to put them in the incubator, to notify the hospital, to conduct the examinations (and together with them the procedures of identification and adoption process) and to wait for the family concerned. Life windows can’t be a very common solution – according to the Opoka Foundation, they saved only 64 children from 2006 to 2013 – but every life here is worth gold. Every child in the window of life is one child less in the cabbage.
2583	119	Intelligent Education 
2583	121	This is just an ad hoc action. According to Hippocrates paremia, morbum evitare quam curare facilius est is better to prevent than to treat. What is the best way to prevent abortion? In the same, which can prevent unwanted pregnancies (and not, abortion as a method of contraception is still considered incorrect): through appropriate sexual education. The mystery of polysinel – although very scary in the 21st century Europe – is that the gross of unplanned beginnings arises from the ignorance of its own organism. Myths such as “how I pull out, you won’t get out” or “for the first time you can’t get pregnant” – and even so unlikely “methodes” of contraception like jumping on one leg after a relationship to remove sperm from the body – are still present in the awareness of society. This is also due to the treatment of sex as a topic of taboo – especially in intergenerational relations – as well as the inappropriate approach of the institutions that form us in school years. Sexual education is therefore obtained in contacts with colleagues, on pornographic sites and in the letter section to the editorial of popular youth letters. By creating a reasonable educational program in schools, we have a much greater chance of fertilizing the minds of the youth before these youth will consciously fertilize each other their bodies. This, of course, requires an effort – an effort incomparably greater than the legal prohibition of abortion practices and the introduction of a clause of conscience at every stage, from a gynecologist to a lady in the pharmacy – but if we want to have a healthy functioning state, this effort cannot be avoided.
2583	123	Consciousness of your actions 
2583	125	Of course, it would not be true to say that any abortion in every way is depravation. Certainly sometimes there are reasonable arguments when the break of pregnancy is caused by a higher good. Certainly for this higher good is not the previous lack of brain in the future unacceptable parent (for once that the child is not guilty of anything here, and two that you have to take responsibility for your actions) or so-called. “The Fall” etc. Deciding on co-life – even if in practice it is the hormones, and not the gray cells direct our behavior – should be aware of the possible consequences. Solving the potential post factum problem through a procedure or a tablet is equally legitimate as dismissing a police officer who stopped us for driving after a drunk.
2583	127	And above all reason.
2583	129	And all of this is accompanied. Suitable sexual education, treating the fetus as a man, not a new model of toy (a child with suspicion of physical disability or for example. The Downa team is in principle eligible for the procedure – because of our history, we don’t even need to pronounce the names of a man who had very similar opinions; do we really want to be this leader with a specific micro-scale ass?Taking consequences for your actions – just so much, or so much, is enough to make a reasonable compromise. The anti-abortion law will then counteract the pathology, just as the law on treasury education counteract the extreme cases, and not the conscious citizen who wants to drink a wine lamp for lunch.
259	1	Expert OSW: Russian troll factories are trying to show Ukrainian refugees in negative light.
259	3	“These issues in Polish-Ukrainian relations, especially historical confusion, are willingly used by Russian propaganda to torture Poles and Ukrainians,” said Katarina Chavrylo, an expert at the Warsaw Centre for Eastern Studies (OSW). She added that the Kremlin propagandists are trying to reach all EU countries with a negative message about refugees.
259	5	by TW. The troll factories are also coming and will reach in the coming months after content showing in the negative light of Ukrainian refugees in Poland, she added.
259	9	The exploitation of issues relating to Ukrainian citizens fleeing to the West has a wider dimension and is not related only to Poland. Propagandists are trying to reach the societies in the EU countries by spreading content that would prove that refugees are the source of danger - that is to lead to a situation that they will not be (refugees -przyp. RMF FM is welcome. The current situation (war of Russia with Ukraine - etc. RMF FM) makes the rhetoric measured in refugees an important element in the Kremlin disinformation. Its primary objective is to minimize the support of the West for Ukraine, Chavryla said.
259	11	The Russian narrative is significantly spread in Hungary, in Serbia, in part in Germany.
259	13	According to the Russian analyst. trolls (controlled by the state companies engaged in the publication of propaganda content on the Internet, mainly on forums and social networks - e.g. RMF FM) continues to hire new people, which indicates the intensification of the Kremlin’s activities in the field of information struggle.
259	15	The expert stressed that the long-term investment by the Kremlin in the friendly expert and media environments in the West does not bring the expected results. The war with Ukraine completely changed the situation, even turning it up with the feet. First, the scale and brutality of Russian crimes against civilians in Ukraine are obvious and difficult to defend. Secondly, the EU and U.S. sanctions imposed on the Russian media, resulting in the restriction of their broadcasting in the Western countries, significantly reduced the scope of propaganda. As for European countries, however, the Russian narrative is significantly broken out in Hungary and Serbia, and in part also in Germany.
259	17	It is a trip that some journalists enjoy.
259	19	The speakers pointed to the “usuality” of some Western journalists in the regime broadcast of the Russian television.
259	21	"The Kremlin organizes for such people study trips to occupied areas, for example. to Mariupola. In recent years they have been involved. German and French reporters, which was by Russian television. They are representatives of the Nizhny Novgorod media, but their presence is enough for the Kremlin television to build a propaganda message about ""objective Western reporters seeking the truth, despite the Western censorship,"" the analyst said."
259	23	Do Russians Trust Television? The results of the survey are not mercyful.
259	25	According to the expert of the Warsaw Center published in recent days, the survey of the Russian public opinion, carried out by the international company GroupM and showing a decline in the trust of the Russians in state television, should not be treated as representative. The study was valuable because it confirmed the trend that has been visible for years - television remains the main source of information for the Russians, but confidence in it decreases. In this survey, however, only respondents from large cities, counting more than 100,000, took part. People, therefore, the results cannot be treated as marvelous. In the Russian province, where Putin enjoys the greatest support, television plays a much greater role than in the urban centers.
259	27	"The aggressor uses every opportunity to reach the inhabitants with the ""suitable"" content."
259	29	"Chavryla also referred to the propaganda ""members"" of Russian activities in the occupied territories of eastern and southern Ukraine."
259	31	"The invaders do not spread any subtle message there, but they put strict forces on solutions to scare the inhabitants. This scheme includes m.in. the deactivation of Ukrainian television and its replacement with Russian programs, as well as the destruction of access to Ukrainian internet connections and mobile networks. The aggressor uses every opportunity to reach the inhabitants with ""appropriate"" pro-Russian content - for example. There are reports of the dissemination of ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" (the journal publishing propaganda content) along with humanitarian aid, the OSW expert stressed."
2590	1	CPR to Solidarna Polska: Together to arrange the public space by removing the symbols of foreign power
2590	3	“Today we are sending this project to the Solidarity Poland, which with 20 members can report it to the Marchalkovsk Lack, so that from the spring of 2023 there is no monumental object in the public space that celebrates the Red Army, I or II Army “Polish War”, the People’s Army of Poland or even Otton von Bismarck. The current solutions enable the defense of the facilities of glory by numerous municipal governments, for example. Lewina Brzeskiego or Olsztina. If the Parliament approves our draft, then on 1 January 2023 all of this kind of facilities would be under the supervision of the owners of the competent wojewoda and if they are currently in the register of monuments will be detected from it. This will allow them to be removed. Of course, this project is also a proportional reaction to the removal of the Polish flag from the Polish war cemetery in Mednoya and Katyn by the Russians. Importantly, the objects of foreign glory will no longer be legally protected as monuments, and therefore will not be covered by the disposal of the article. 261 Criminal Code. We are expecting an attitude in this matter from the Solidarity of Poland,” says Paul Čiž, a spokesman for the Union of Christian Families. Conversation with the marketer.
2590	5	The Independent Gazette: Mr. Attorney, where does this initiative come from?
2590	7	ZCHR spokesman Paul Zyzh: Yes, the armies of the Russian Federation have attacked Ukraine. At the same time, some municipalities defend monuments of gratitude to the Red Army, for example. Municipality of Lewin Brzeski or Olsztina. Such actions must be stopped, and hundreds of totalitarian symbols, as well as Prussian militarism, are removed. There are few people who know that there is no so-called Poland. The Bismarck Tower. The building was built to remind the Chancellor of the Reich, Otton von Bismarck. In the workshops, in Dzieržoniov, in Jańska Gora, in Lúbork, in Mrągov, in Okonk, in Ostrod, in Szczecin, in Świdvina, in Swiebodzin, in Velen, in Sobotka, in Green Gora, in Žagania and Žarach. It’s hard for all these symbols to shake our cities. The Polish People's Army does not deserve to be commemorated either. On September 17, 1939, the USSR became a participant in World War II as a ally of the Third Reich. Prime Minister Vladimir Sikorsky expressed the view that Russia has betrayed, going armedly to help the Germans and hit us in the agreed moment with a knife in the back: “(...) from now on we are in war with the Soviets on the same level with the Germans.” On April 25, 1943, Stalin broke his relations with the Polish government. It should be mentioned that the President of the Republic of Poland, Vladimir Rashkiewicz, refused to sign the Sikorsky-Majski Agreement of 30 July 1941 and therefore the reintroduction to the territory of the 2nd Republic of the Red Army in the years 1944-45 occurred without the formal consent of the legal Polish government, i.e. the implementation of the premises of illegal occupation. In June 1943, Wodz Naczelny and Prime Minister of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic. If we don’t remember the Polnische Wermacht – the armed forces of the Kingdom of Poland formed by the act of 5 November in the period from 10 April 1917, when the Austro-Hungary transferred the Polish Postal Corps under the order of the General Governor of Warsaw Hans Hartwig von Beseler, until 13 October 1918 – there is no reason to remember in the public space the so-called. The Second Army of Polish Army or the People's Army of Polish Army. The drop. What is very important, you will no longer be prosecuting anyone for their alleged damage to the article. 261 Criminal Code.
2590	9	NGO: You are counting on the support of Solidarity Poland. But what about the ps?
2590	11	This will be revealed, though some of the Law and Justice politicians were susceptible to the communist legend that the Berling Army is our Polish armed forces. It happens that the politicians of the PiS put flowers under the monuments of the I or II Army “Polish War”. It is said that in this formation served the Poles. This is clear, but no honor generally I or II Army “Polish War” belongs. This is as if we are officially constantly undermining the position of the Polish legal authorities in London. It is time to arrange historical facts and we hope that the Parliamentarians of the Solidarity of Poland “bear as necessary.” It is worth emphasizing that about the Monuments of the Red Army in Mikolin, in the village of Lewin Brzeski or in Olsztina, the deputy Janusz Kowalski from the SP came with expensive assistance. So we call on the Zbigniew Ziobro party: together, let us arrange the public space by removing the symbols of foreign power.

2591	3	“The federal government (in Berlin) now has to do everything to ensure the supply of energy. We need to talk to Russia, despite the war that breaches international law, about giving Nord Stream 2 to operation for a certain time, unless gas supply can be guaranteed otherwise,” Ernst said.
2591	5	“The cessation of gas supply could irreversibly damage + industrial rectum + Germany,” he added.

2594	1	The Japanese of the War in Ukraine. Just a shock...

2594	7	"I would repeat as many times as needed. The Western establishment collapsed the Ukrainian government with the help of the Nazis in 2014 to trigger a replacement war against Russia. The majority of the people of the West bought an open lies that Russia has invaded Ukraine unprovocately, while in fact Ukraine has harmlessly bombed the Russian-speaking population, massacring, tortured and depriving its resources for life over the past eight years. Many of us have raised their voices on this issue just to be called ""Putin's lover"", ""Russian boots"" and so on. Meanwhile, the pines of the Western war against Russia continue to die in Ukraine. The U.S. supported Ukrainian government sends untrained civilians aged 18 to 60 to the front line. Do you know what it means?"
2594	9	"I am 54 years old and have a son who is 18 years old. We would die for Western imperialism if we were Ukrainians. The Ukrainian establishment kills its own officials, journalists, and anyone who stands against their way of Western imperialism, while continuing to draw Russian-speaking Eastern Ukrainians as ""separatists"". This is what it means “to be with Ukraine”. This means subsidizing the western defence industry, transforming peacefully coexisting nations into killing each other, restructuring the economy to accept the western oligarchs, and selling public property to those draper. People may think it’s just harmless signaling the virtue to prove how “good” you are in their communities to repeat the current imperial password, but people actually suffer and die for that reason. The same thing happened on the whole planet. I am from Japan. I have relatives there. What happens to Ukraine can happen to any U.S. supported Asian country, as China is the primary target of the empire. I feel the sadness and pain of the Ukrainians, the Russians and all the people who suffer from the imperial violence of the United States."
2594	11	From the last moment:
2594	13	Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead in Nara, Japan. This is quite shocking, partly because it is Japan where such things are rare, and he himself is the grandson of the war criminal from the time of World War II, Kishi Nobusuke, who also became Prime Minister after the war. Their political party - the Liberal Democratic Party - is known for being supported by the CIA. Shinzo Abe was known for his sympathy to the Russian position on the war in Ukraine.
2595	1	13 million people in the African Mountains will suffer hunger due to global warming
2595	3	This will definitely be a difficult year for Africa, and the forecasts regarding the level of difficulty from a month to a month are becoming more and more pessimistic. According to the UN, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya are the most affected.
2595	5	The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) will need $327 million to meet the most urgent housing needs in the coming months and to help rural communities respond to the increasingly awareness of climate shocks. The most exposed to famine is the African Mountains: Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.
2595	7	3 years without rain
2595	9	There has been no rain in all three countries for three years, causing the highest drought since 1981.
2595	11	“The reefs are destroyed, livestock is dying, hunger is growing, and all this is through the repeated droughts that touch the African Horn,” said WFP Regional Director of Eastern Africa, Michael Dunford. Dunford warns that without adequate humanitarian assistance, the Somali humanitarian crisis of 2011, when 250,000 people died of hunger, may be repeated. And this, unfortunately, is unexcluded, because the average fall instead of growing, according to the forecast, is expected to fall.
2595	13	The situation is critical in the south-eastern part of Ethiopia – according to UNICEF by mid-March of this year, up to 6 million people in these areas may need humanitarian aid. In neighboring Somalia, this number is estimated to exceed 7 million.
2595	15	Africa is gathering what we sowed
2595	17	Despite being the continent that at least contributes to global warming, Africa feels climate change the most severe and has the most serious consequences. The drought in the African Ridge is the best example of this. Over the past 100 years, surface temperatures in Africa have risen from 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. According to scientists, in this century they are expected to exceed even those 2 degrees.
2595	19	UNICEF reports that, as a result of the drought, about 15,000 children have left school to help pick up water and other daily tasks. A representative of UNICEF in Ethiopia at the UN briefing held in Geneva, via a video conference said that a large part of the water sources was drown and stressed the need to renew the wells, wrap new and bring water to healthcare centers.
2595	21	None of the places in the world has shown as beneficial as tragic in the consequences could be ignoring the climate disaster. For now, the price for the galoping and unbalanced capitalism has paid the least due to the whole confusion of Africa, but it is only a matter of time until the same problems that the Africans are facing now come to the north.
2598	1	Colonialism continues. It is one of the causes of climate change.
2598	3	In the third part of the sixth report of the Intergovernmental Team. Climate Change (IPCC), the scientists for the first time identified colonialism as the historic and current cause of the climate crisis, which is the largest global threat to humanity.
2598	5	Colonialism is not a uniform phenomenon, but it can be seen as a conquest of territories and states, accompanied by three types of violence: cultural violence through the denial of the indigenous culture, economic violence through the recovery of the population, and political violence through the oppression and recovery of the self-establishment of the population.
2598	7	The impact of colonialism on nature is clear and can be seen through huge mines, polluted rivers and exploited land. On all continents, the colonizers cut off marine forests, slopes, tropical forests and wetlands to make a place for stones, plantations, ranks, roads and railways.
2598	9	The fact that the IPCC report has found that one specific word may not seem great, but it is quite the opposite. Together with each report, the IPCC publishes a summary for decision makers. This summary is thoroughly analyzed and discussed line by line - not only by the best scientists in the world, but also by officials representing 195 governments, which have an impact on the final summary and often formulate comments regarding individual words or feedback.
2598	11	The fact that “colonialism” was found in the summary means that officials and scientists from all over the world see the significant role that this phenomenon has played in “heating” our planet and destroying its nature. The Atmos magazine noted that the role of colonialism in triggering the climate crisis has been part of the narrative of the climate justice movement for decades. For example, during last year’s COP26, the Brazilian activist for the indigenous population, Taily Terena, opened the Pavilion of the Indigenous Peoples, saying that “colonialism has caused climate change” and the solution is “to grant the rights to the indigenous population”.
2598	13	How did “colonialism” appear in the IPCC report? First of all, it was not without influence that this time more women and people with white skin color worked on the report, and therefore social groups affected by this phenomenon. Secondly, as Atmos points out, within eight years of the last IPCC report, there has been an explosion of the literature indicating the link between climate change and colonialism. The IPCC reports compile the findings of thousands of existing work. The authors compose them in whole and present a full picture of scientific consensus to the public.
2598	15	"One of the studies indicating the bonds between colonialism and climate change was published in the journal ""PNAS"" in 2020. a couple of archaeologists analyzed the climate in the Caribbean Islands and in the southwestern part of the Indian Ocean. Researchers have discovered how changes have been addressed by the history of colonization and injustice. The Caribbean is facing increasingly intense hurricanes driven by warming oceans. Furthermore, these risks are expected to increase with climate change caused by human activity."
2598	17	The researchers also found that the colonization forced the residents of the islands to leave the methods of building resistant to these phenomena of houses. Archaeological excavations carried out in the Caribbean have revealed the history of the creation of round buildings with deeply settled columns made of strong local wood and light roofs covered with stripes. However, after the colonization of the islands, European architecture evaporated this traditional. Today’s houses are made of armed concrete, not of local materials, and are easily destroyed during hurricanes. This reduces the chance of the building to survive and rebuild after intense tropical storms.
2598	19	Similarly, the forests and other natural resources of Madagascar have been destroyed by Europeans who wanted to make greater profits from the colonies there. Today, the descendants of the indigenous population live in poorer lands, where the effects of land degradation, erosion and landslides are seen, making these lands even more exposed to climate change.
2598	21	However, the relationship of colonialism with climate change is not just a relic of the past. Currently, the carbon emission compensation concept is also analyzed as a new form of this phenomenon. This is because it allows developed countries to exploit developing landscapes by using their low carbon emissions to compensate for their increasing carbon emissions.
2598	23	"Many companies are committed to climate neutrality. To this goal, more and more of them are seeking coal loans (from ang. carbon offsets. According to the strategic consultancy company McKinsey, the voluntary coal loans market could reach a value of up to $50 billion by 2030. The term ""carbon compensation"" refers to carbon whose emissions are reduced, avoided or extracted from the atmosphere in order to compensate for emissions produced elsewhere."
2598	25	The majority of carbon emission compensation projects are on reinsertion. Reducing carbon emissions by planting more trees in developing countries may seem to be a good idea. However, through initiatives aimed at slowing down the pace of climate change, wealthy countries dominate less the poor and their inhabitants, creating a new form of neocolonialism – climate colonialism. Rich countries invest in the countries of the global South and dictate how to maintain land and forests to people who have lived there for thousands of years. When the new rule that the people in power want to accept by the indigenous population collides with how indigenous groups usually deal with their own land, it may potentially lead to displacement, and even violence.
2598	27	In 2014, the Oakland Institute revealed that the Kenya Forest Service, funded by the World Bank, threatened, and even arrested members of the Sengwer community to gain land under forestry with the purpose of compensating CO2. At the United Nations meeting in 2016, the native leader of the Bear Islands accused developed countries of privatizing and selling holy forests and land that are their own. Carbon offset projects hurt the population, changing the economic system on which its survival is based.
2598	29	Most carbon emission compensation projects are located in global Southern countries, and most are purchased by global Northern countries. Instead of thus attracting governments to responsibility and changing existing production and consumption patterns, undertakings in developed countries use carbon offset as a form of dismissal. They are forcing global Southern countries to change their economies so that these global Northern countries can continue to emite CO2.
2598	31	How can we eliminate climate colonialism? First, by providing co-decision to the indigenous inhabitants in climate investments concerning their land and landscape transformation, as well as simply by returning their land. It is also important to finance long-term land management programmes by indigenous people and to provide indigenous people with autonomy in decision-making on expenditure, as well as the use of ecological knowledge of local communities.
2599	1	Korwin-Mikke: “Ice is coming to the Antarctica.” Not to Defense
2599	3	"Confederation Ambassador Janusz Korwin-Mikke convinced on August 6 in Polish Radio 24, that what is said about the need to close coal power plants or promote more ecological sources of energy is ""fake"" and humanity ""destroyed"". “These ecologists were crazy, the Confederation politician was crazy. Korwin-Mikke talked about the natural cycle of carbon circulation in the environment and believed that this element ""was in the air, somehow the earth survived."" When it comes back to the air, what will happen? Heat and very well. We are threatened that the temperature will rise by two degrees, well and great. It will be in Poland as in Prague Czech, so nothing so terrible will be."
2599	5	"Korwin-Mikke continued to talk about the ""previous global warming"" which - as he claimed - occurred around the 11th century, when Greenland was ""green land, as the name itself indicates."" He also spoke of the “top of global cold” and of the “local, global cold” around 1600. “It’s unlikely that the water level will rise specifically,” said Korwin-Mikke. He added that 30 years ago he read that in 20 years the Maldives will be underwater. In the meantime, the real estate prices in Maldives are going up, he said."
2599	7	“Ecologists don’t say one thing.”
2599	9	Janus Korwin-Mike's conclusion was the thesis about the Antarctica, on which is alleged to be a ice cover. The politician explained that the reason for the increase of ice is the move over this continent of water steam. “Ecologists don’t say one thing: in fact, ice turns into water, it’s true, but water turns into a pair,” he said. For example, in Florida, everyone can make sure that it’s dust, right? Then there is a couple, the couple, by the way, collapsed in the province of St. Catherine in Brazil. In Brazil, the snow has been invisible for 200 years and it is controversial, and then this pair flies over the Antarctica and, to the ecologists, the Antarctica gets ice. This is the pair above Grenland, it dissolves, pars, and travels to the south,” said Korwin-Mikke.
2599	11	The recording with the speech of Janus Korwin-Mikké we showed to Dr. Jakub Malecki, a glaciologist-hydrologist engaged in the study of glaciers. It is associated with Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. The expert found it impossible to defend the statement that ice in Antarctica is coming. It’s becoming less and less, and this is the result of human activity over the past more than a hundred years.
2599	13	Prague in Warsaw? “Ricozetem oberwie man”
2599	15	Dr. Jakub Małecki explains that climate change has occurred several times in Earth's history, which has been influenced by the activity of the Sun, the Earth's orbit cycles and the changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. “Specially these recent changes interest us today, because we are experiencing them in a very fast pace,” says Dr. Małecki. About 12 thousand. It took about 1,500 years to raise the average global temperature by 1 degrees Celsius. “We and our CO2 emissions did it ten times faster,” he notes.
2599	17	It further explains that nature emits as many greenhouse gases as it is able to absorb. Now this is impossible – the total CO2 emissions of nature and humans are slightly greater than the total absorption. The excess of CO2 decreases with each year, and the disproportion between natural and actual levels increases.
2599	19	"Will it happen in Poland as in Prague and ""there's nothing so terrible""? Dr. Małecki replies that in Poland the global warming by 2 degrees can mean a 3-degree or even greater increase in temperature. - Such warming means huge and harmful changes for nature, among other things for the plants, fauna and hydrology of the country. It’s not good, because the righteous always overwees then man,” he says. He notes that the temperature rise of one degree Celsius over the past a little more than 100 years is an intermediate value for the entire planet, including covering it in most oceans. The earth is heating faster than the ocean."
2599	21	The ice in Antarctica passes through submarine warming, not hot air.
2599	23	Dr. Jakub Małecki says that greater warming is well visible in the polar regions - some have already warmed even a few degrees Celsius. In the surrounding coast of the northern Arctic, the floating coast of the sea disappears, the mountainous glaciers disappear, the glaciers of Grenland flourishes faster and faster.
2599	25	"Contrary to what Janusz Korwin-Mikke suggests, the island’s discoverer and banita Eryk Rudy, named Grenland ( literally “green land”), wanted to encourage Iceland’s settlers to colonize it. ""In the times after Christ's birth, it was never green, that is, with a clearly smaller reach of ice than today,"" Dr. Małecki notes. There was no global warming around the 11th century, and until 1650 there was no global warming. Temperature changes are noted as much as possible locally or regionally. “Studies show that the global climate cooled unbelievably slowly but systematically from around the year 5000 BC until the 19th century, when human activity seriously entered the climate game,” says Dr. Małecki."
2599	27	As he explains, the ice situation around the south is more complex than in the north. It is necessary to clearly separate the sea ice (cross) falling on the South Ocean and the land ice on the continent of Antarctica. Today, the land occupies a bit greater surface than in the 1980s. Stronger winds push it further and further from the coast. “The ice is generally systematically losing mass and summaryly the pace is growing,” Dr. Małecki emphasizes.
2599	29	The ice is divided into two main parts: the larger east and the smaller west. “The eastern part remains bad: most of the developments in the last two or three decades show either a stable mass, even with growth periods, or only relatively small losses,” the expert explains. “It’s worse with the western part that loses mass quickly,” he added.
2599	31	This occurs in a smaller degree due to the more intense solving of the surface, and above all by the submarine solving and the breakdown of ice mountains into the ocean. Therefore, the greatest danger for Antarctica is not the increasing temperature of the air, but the increasing temperature of the water. Therefore, it is not possible to defend the claim that ice in Antarctica is coming. She summarically loses it, even though in the interior of the continent the temperature never rises above zero, says Dr. Jakub Malecki.
2599	33	Increased water supply? The ice cream is losing mass.
2599	35	In an analysis for Konkret24, Dr. Małecki emphasizes that he is unknown any scientific sources that in the 1990s would alarm against the flooding of the Maldives around 2010. This risk is real for 2100, because it is the flatest and lowest country in the world, says Dr. Małecki. It adds that these islands may become unsuitable for living due to potentially much greater than the previous range of storm waves or subterms.
2599	37	The mountainous glaciers around the world and the glaciers of Grenland and the Antarctica, dropping their soluble water from the soil to the ocean and raising its level. “Ice is the largest shareholder of this process, behind it is the thermal extensibility of the heating oceans,” Dr. Jakub Małecki explains. The current rate of this growth is 3-4 cm per decade. Too small to observe them with an empty eye, but detectable for devices and satellites. “If the rate of CO2 emissions will continue to rise, by the end of the 21st century the sea level can rise an average of even a few meters compared to pre-industrial times,” the expert estimates.
2599	39	"It emphasizes that increased steam from the oceans is unable to remove the excess of water in the oceans, because after a short time from the steam, the water enters the ocean back like rain or water. “Augmented steering may, however, lead to greater falls, and such a trend is actually observed in some regions of the world,” said Dr. Małecki, adding that this is the case in some districts, which results in greater snow supplies. ""Unfortunately, these increases are most often too small to compensate for negative changes caused by higher temperatures and despite the snow winters, these glaciers are still losing mass,"" he says. ""In the eastern Antarctica, this mechanism is likely to contribute to the relative stability of this part of the land,"" he added."
2599	41	The expert, however, denies that larger snowfalls in the Antarctica were associated with steering in Florida and transporting steering through Brazil, where the last snowfall occurred in the south. - First, the transmission of the pair between the northern and southern hemisphere is difficult by equatorial winds. Second, the last snowfall in southern Brazil did not come from the north, but from the Antarctica, that is, from the south, says Dr. Małecki. And it reminds that the snowfall in Brazil occurs once every 200 years.
