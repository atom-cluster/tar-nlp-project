251	1	Nord Stream 2 is Germany's biggest problem
251	3	The Nord Stream 2 and the related energy dependence on Russia are the biggest problem of Germany’s foreign policy, the newspaper “Sueddeutsche Zeitung” writes, stressing that Germany must get rid of “the lost dependence” on Russian gas.
251	5	Such dependence existed already during the Cold War, but then it was argued that the supplier and the customer need each other and should in their own interest separate business from politics.
251	7	Germany needs Russian gas, and Russia German money, but “the President of Russia (Wladimir Putin) thinks strategically” and the issue of income has been put to a further plan.
251	9	“Russia has long implemented its strategy to divide the European Union, to isolate the individual countries, and thus to break down the strongest weapon of Europe: economic unity,” the newspaper assesses, noting that such a approach can protect it from sanctions, and also “serves the primary goal of keeping the EU and its democratic ideals at a distance.”
251	11	“The main objective of this destabilization policy is Germany, because this country has the greatest influence in Europe, and society and politics are divided in Russia’s perception.”
251	13	“Obviously there is no technical problem behind it, but a political intention that President Vladimir Putin has often and directly emphasized: if the NS2 gas pipeline is finally launched, the gas deficiency will end,” he wrote, adding that such chantage requires a difficult decision: surrender or resistance.
251	15	The approval of the NS2 gas pipeline will be the most important decision in foreign policy that the new federal government will inherit after the previous, which will force the new ruling coalition to take a position on this issue, the newspaper notes.
251	17	"As he assesses, since the problematic issue of Nord Stream 2 has been unresolved for a long time, ""the previous arguments for its construction will be weak"" - for example. If Russia cuts the gas pipeline, Ukraine and the countries of Central Europe will be able to supply the so-called gas pipeline. Reverse from Germany. The newspaper, however, points out that ""if gas is really low and German gas suppliers begin to break down every square meter, the conflict will move to Western Europe."""
251	19	There are many problems, and “the buyer is stuck in a network of dependence and his own vulnerability to chantage.” In this situation, the outcome is only one - the Germans have to get rid of dependence on Russia by finding other sources of supply, alternative sources of energy, the firmness in interpreting the supply contract and finally the political decision to close the gas station - the newspaper assesses.
251	21	“Not only Ukraine becomes a potential target through Russia’s gas policy, Germany is also falling into a lost dependence. The problem does not even decline,” the Sueddeutsche Zeitung summarizes.

2510	1	War in Ukraine: the latest news.
2510	3	War in Ukraine live: below in the points we present a collection of the most important information from the war front in Ukraine and the Polish and world economy.
2510	5	Currently, Russian actions outside the Donbass have no character that would prove the Kremlin’s aspiration to occupy further areas, the experts of the Centre for Eastern Studies say. The Russian units are limited to the so-called improving the tactical situation and expanding defence positions.
2510	7	However, the information of the U.S. intelligence agency, to which the OSCE is calling, may prove that Russia does not give up its plans for further expansion in the direction of Zaporozh, the Crown Hill and Christmas.
2510	9	Finland and Sweden formally submitted an application for membership in the NATO on Wednesday 18 May. The proposal is considered one of the most significant changes in international security in decades.
2510	11	The evacuation of soldiers from the Azovstal hunt is ongoing, who surrendered after many weeks of hard resistance to the Russian occupation. It ends with one of the hardest and hardest battles in this war. President Zelensky said in a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron that the evacuation is under the supervision of the Ukrainian authorities in the manner of exchange of war prisoners, but they do not provide details about the operation. It is currently unknown how many people are still in the Hut, and how many are already in the territory of Russia. Their further fate is also under question, since it is unknown whether Russia, in accordance with the agreement, will decide to exchange war prisoners.
2510	13	The Russian occupation of Mariupol lasted more than ten weeks. The resistance of Ukraine significantly delayed the possibility of Russia to gain full control over the city and caused major losses of Russian forces.
2510	15	In recent weeks, Russia has released the senior commanders that are believed to have failed in the early stages of the invasion of Ukraine, the British Defence Department said, “This is likely to be even more burdened by the centralized model of leadership, as officers are increasingly trying to entrust key decisions to their boss. Under these conditions, it will be difficult for Russia to recover the initiative” in the armed operations, the ministry’s experts indicate.
25100	3	Donald Tusk says he will conduct a pilot on the shortening of the working week. His political opponents accuse him of stealing other people’s ideas, hypocrisy and making empty promises. Is a four-day week of work meaningful? According to some economists, changes are inevitable. But now it is not the right time for them.
25100	5	A few days ago, Donald Tusk announced that his electoral proposal would be to shorten the working hours of the Poles. “In Poland we should, and this will be my proposal, if we win the elections – I apologize: when we win the elections – to start the program of the short working week as soon as possible,” he said in Szczecin during a meeting with young people Meet Up New Generation of the Civil Platform.
25100	7	"The program could be based on a shortening of the working day, for example. up to 7 hours or a week of work up to four days. There is no reduction in wages. The implementation of the reform throughout the country would depend on the positive effects of the previous pilotation. To the election, Tusk has to present his detailed project. The topic was quickly attracted by other politicians. First, Adrian Zandberg from the Party Together pointed out that his group had presented a similar proposal a few years ago. In 2018, the party gathered signatures under a civil draft law on the shorter working time by 7 hours, without a reduction in wages. “7 hours are more time for the family and for the development of interests,” the Party Together project was promoted. “I offer 7 hours of work a week! Or not - in a month,"" said then Boris Budka from the PO, whose post in social media politicians of the Party Together did not hesitate to remind now. Zandberg ironizes that he does not doubt the spiritual change of the PO politicians, but recommends voting for the party, which is the actual author of the proposal. In turn, Robert Biedron from New Left indicated that his group would submit a draft law on a four-day working week and see what will happen. “We will check Donald Tusk and all the PO members, as well as other groups, whether they will support us during the vote,” Biedron said in one of the TV shows. Hanna Gill-Friday from Poland 2050 stated that there is nothing against the experiment. For this, Szymon Hołownia, the leader of Poland in 2050, the idea stroped: “It is really difficult to understand the purpose of the discussion of a four-day working week in a time when people do everything they can to earn more, so that it will finally stop missing,” he wrote on Twitter."
25100	9	Tusk promises 4 days of work. Stay up for 6 days
25100	11	The strong opponent of the proposal is Artur Dziambor from the Freedom Party. “The four-day working week is an increase in the costs of operating companies by 25 percent,” the deputy said. Unless, as he says, a shorter working time will be linked to a reduction in wages. According to him, the time of work in the company depends on the employee's agreement with the boss. And imposing them for a shorter working time, strikes their freedom. Artur Dziambor also has no doubt that by presenting such a proposal, Tusk accuses the network of a younger, more leftist electorate. He is followed by Sławomir Mentzen, the chairman of the Congress of Polish Business, a member of the KORVIN party. “If someone thinks that going to work four rather than five days a week increases productivity, then let it lead your company and with this patent you get out of the competition,” Sławomir Mentzen laughed on Facebook.
25100	13	The proposal was also addressed by PiS President Jarosław Kaczyński during his visit to Grójc. He claims that the idea should worry the voters.
25100	15	I promised a four-day week of work. If you take into account how it was with their previous important promises, then it will be six-day! I see it in the eyes of the soul. First for two months four days, then the saying: but the society has not grown up, it has not succeeded, but now it has to be done, six - said Jarosław Kaczyński.
25100	17	Beata Mazurek from PiS reminded that the PO voted against free Sunday in trade. And now suddenly this party wants to be the messenger of shortening the working time. According to her, Tusk is a “dangerous populist.”
25100	19	Waldemar Buda, Minister of Development and Technology, said: “As he had to lower taxes, he has raised them. As he had to lower his retirement age, he had raised him. I’d be afraid if in this performance, behind this solution are not the working Sabbaths,” he told Polsat News. And he added that PiS also conducted calculations for the four-day working week. He also stated that the current economic situation is not favorable to the introduction of such changes.
25100	21	Currently, the government is focused on the implementation of flexible forms of employment, among others. Remote work (the government draft law is in the Seime, it has been passed to the Seime Extraordinary Commission). Reducing a week of work does not come into play. Marlena Maląg, Minister of Family and Social Policy, on an antenna of the Polish Radio reminded that today nothing stands at the obstacle for the employer and the worker to agree on a shorter working time if there is such a need.
25100	23	We want to work less. Not less to earn
25100	25	The proposal to shorten the working time may have electoral potential. Hays’s survey shows that the four-day work model likes 96 percent. The respondents. On the other hand, the shorter working week and the resulting reduction of wages by 80 percent, supported only 19 percent. and surveyed. Another study, the Polish Labour Market Barometer, showed that in addition to the medical care package, the four-day working week is the most expected bonus by employees. The initiative of Donald Tusk can be regarded as an element of the pre-election game. This is also not the first time that we look at a young, leftist electorate. The other thing, whether the PO in this flirting with a less or more leftist voter is reliable. Tusk, talking about a four-day week of work, didn’t say much. He indicated, among other things, that this is not the answer to today and that taking into account the pandemic experience and the working automation awaiting us, the challenges of working time will need to be taken seriously. The simple electoral promises and the expectations of the electorate are one, and the other - whether in our realities such a solution has any sense at all.
25100	27	Different rankings (data vary depending on the research methodology) put us in the top of the most developed nations in Europe. According to the report “Working time in 2019-2020” prepared by Eurofound, Poland in 2020 worked an average of 1848 hours. In Germany -1574 hours. A detailed survey. The year was conducted by UCE Research and Son of Poland. According to the study, 21% of people worked more than 8 hours a day. participants in the research. In turn 13 percent. The respondents worked 9-10 hours, and 8 percent. - more than 10 hours a day (804 professional Poles were asked). The Eurostat survey shows that in 2021 the average working time in Poland was 40.3 hours. Weekly. According to this stop, the Serbs worked more (43.3 hours) and Greeks (40,6 hours) The shortest time. The year was working in the Netherlands, with an average of 31.6 hours. Weekly. Then in Norway (34.2 hours).Denmark (34.8 hours)Germany (35.2 hours) The researchers found that in the countries with the highest number of jobs, the lowest hourly fees are paid. So, will the reduction of working time automatically improve its efficiency, and what are the economic parameters? This is not the case, the economists say. The shorter working time and higher wages can be the result of the development of the economy, not its engine.
25100	29	The key to shortening work time andining wages is to increase work efficiency. The aim is to produce the same value of products or services with less working hours. And this requires progress in automation, robotics, the application of new technologies and artificial intelligence. Investments in these areas are needed. Short work is the inevitable direction in which the world is moving, but implementing this direction is a matter of at least a decade. This cannot be done in a revolutionary way, it is an evolutionary, long-lasting process, says Andrzej Kubisiak, Deputy Director of the Polish Economic Institute.
25100	31	Poland is not the UK.
25100	33	So far, no country has decided to legally introduce a four-day working week. Although, of course, some companies, especially during pandemic exacerbations, have made working hours more flexible. There are countries where daily working hours are shortened. 7 hours in France. Pilots for the four-day working week were conducted on a different scale, among others. in Japan, New Zealand, Iceland. In this recent state, pilot participants noticed that they were more productive, less stressed and better balanced between work and free time. It should be added here that the test was attended by officials from government institutions and the City Council in Rejkiavik, and the investigation lasted 4 years. The experiment is currently being conducted in Spain and the United Kingdom. The British pilot, which launched in June, is the largest ever, comprising 3,000. employees of 70 companies. Its participants are scheduled to work 32 hours a week for a half year, without a wage reduction. Experts emphasize that even if the solution works in another country, it may prove that we do not, or that we do not immediately. The specificity of our economy is different from the specificity of our economy. The British. Small companies dominate. And it may be more difficult to make technological changes.
25100	35	The share of high-developed sectors in the UK economy is higher than in Poland. Our economy is still largely based on sectors in which the working hours are important and determine the success of the company. We should wait for the completion of the pilot, and only then consider such an experiment in Poland - adds Andrzej Kubisiak.
25100	37	“This idea is harmful.”
25100	39	Reducing working hours in our country can be problematic in some sectors. Especially those who are suffering from the lack of employees. This applies to the medical industry. If we shorten the working week, the availability of the doctors will be less, or there will be a fictional shortening of the working time in their case. The medical staff will have to take additional dishes to complete the staff gap. In fact, it will work the same as it is now. The question is, what about the business or gastronomy? Will entrepreneurs stand to maintain the continuity of their if the employee’s working week is 4 days?
25100	41	Cezary Kaźmierczak, Chairman of the Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers, has no doubt: the idea is harmful, infantile and distracted from reality. And some Polish politicians, not only from the PO, reporting such a postulate, behave as if we were a second Switzerland.
25100	43	“Poland is a pretty wealthy country on the background of the world; but on the background of Europe it is no longer the same. Poland has less than 60 percent. GDP per capita in Germany. Germany is one and a half times more productive than Poland and has a higher productivity. If we continue to effectively pursue them, as we have been running for 30 years, and reach the level of life of these rich Western countries, we should not work less, but more to get equal with them,” said Caesar Kaźmierczak, citing the PAP.
25100	45	According to Prof. Jacka Męcina, the Lewiatan Confederation Board Advisor, a four-day working week in our conditions would involve a reduction in wages and a reduction in the number of employees.
25100	47	A simple reduction of a working week from 5 to 4 days means that productivity is generally reduced. The salary should be reduced by about 20 percent. It is not possible to accept the argument that the reduction of working time will be compensated by the increase in performance, because such guarantees are not and there are not always such opportunities. French experiences from the late 1980s. The age showed that the reduction of working time was not compensated by the increase in productivity at all, and the cost of such a solution to the employers cannot be agreed. This would lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of companies and difficulties in the entire economy, says Prof. Jacek Męcina.
25100	49	According to him, the present time, especially in the face of a possible recession, is not the best for experiments. However, the proposed solution cannot be completely rejected. In automated sectors based on modern technologies, a reduction in working time in the future will be desirable.
25100	51	- First of all, such a space will appear in industrial sectors, but also in modern services. Investments in robotization and process automation mean in the first phase huge corporate costs. The question is how we will compensate for this investment. Additionally, we need to remember thatining employment increasingly will require additional investments in raising or changing the qualifications of employees, and this also means heavy costs, says Prof. Jacek Męcina.
25101	1	Not Moscow and Beijing, but Berlin and Brussels. Pigs are looking for enemies in the West.
25101	3	The war in Ukraine actually changed little in PiS’s foreign policy, considering geopolitical threats and challenges for Poland. The Standing Power Camp is a hostage of the anti-Jewish obsession of its leader and the powerful stories of a great Poland and an equally large army of the race below Vienna or Kirchholm. 
25101	5	If false stories are sold to society, then, sooner or later, their inaccessibility to reality is overwhelmed. As with Rydz-Smigly, who believed he was the second Pilsud, that he did not give the III Rzes even a button, so that he could then internate the Romanians and leave on the fate of fate fighting still, already then on the two fronts, divisions. Let’s follow these dwarfs of the president and the rest of the rulers.
25101	7	Germany is an extremely destructive element in Europe, Jarosław Kaczyński said in an interview with the Polish Gazette. He said that Berlin’s goal is “to keep us under the shoes.” He recognised that “there is no Hitler’s madness today,” but “if we look at Bismarck, then – given other historical circumstances of course – the goals are the same.” 
25101	9	Here it should be remembered that Bismarck was not only the creator of the power of the Second Reich, but also the attacking circle of the brutal germanization of the land of the Prussian globe. So did the President of PiS see a new “Kulturkampf” in Berlin’s politics?
25101	11	Curiously, no one else, but the chairman of the NBP, even turned to Kaczynski. Adam Glapiński convinced, strongly consolidated financial markets, that one of our neighbors (there came the word “German”), plans to pull Poland into the euro zone, to build a European federation in a half year and get rid of our sovereignty. 
25101	13	This is a slightly modified echo of the words of the president that fell on the forefront in Kielts. The president said there that the Germans are not a power, but as if they used the EU as a “shadow”, they would be, and we would be under their shoes, and “but it’s a but.” PiS also returns to the narrative of repairs, which has no chance, and with which it has not yet been able to respond to a request for years, because the report on this topic is allegedly “translated into many languages.” Surprisingly, PiS is unable to get money from the Recovery Fund, and moms our eyes with unrealistic compensation from Berlin. 
25101	15	In fact, it is also difficult for Kaczynski to think about his western neighborhood. Once this is the power that wants to sweat us, where otherwise it is only on our expense that the power is planned to explore. Once the Germans are funny, another time threatening. In one city, Kaczynski says that Germany is an economic power, in the other, he turns with his arms that the purchasing power of one euro is about three gold, so not so much, and Polish doctors no longer work there, because “there is less paid than here.” 
25101	17	The President is in fear of Germany with complexes against Germany. And all of this is a political game, aimed at stimulating the society against Berlin, because it is known that without the enemy PiS cannot exist, act and lead campaigns. 
25101	19	Without an imaginary enemy that really doesn’t exist, and with which you don’t have to fight at all. Only such enemies of the PiS can overcome anything like the wrong Knight of La Mancha in the winds, stopping dangerous opponents. 
25101	21	The real enemy – Russia is returning mainly in the propagandistic scattering of inflation as the main and almost the only factor of price growth in Poland and throughout Europe. And in addition, Berlin and Brussels are deeper on our sovereignty than Moscow. And allied with Russia, China is already at all, especially President Dudze, seem to be an attractive colleague to make politics and interests. 
25101	23	Let’s go on. This reversal of the directions from which evil can go is accompanied by the constant drunk of our power – political and military. We will never allow the foot of a Russian soldier to stand on the Polish soil – the prime minister will be in the stand of national pride. But the president can always count on it. Poland is large enough to have a place where the attackers should be buried – it was drowned right after the war in Ukraine. 
25101	25	PiS puts the law on the defence of the homeland in front of the society, which for now does not result, except for the purchases on a bug, without a plan, but for the credit of future generations and questioned by many military plans to enlarge the army. 
25101	27	The Kaczynski army of Poland sees a huge, and that also has to hold us nationally. And how it would come about what, it would still be appelled to what Andrzej Duda himself suggested, asked about Putin's possible aggression against Poland.
25101	29	The potential threat exists – he replied – but just please note that in Poland there are more than 10,000 soldiers of the world’s largest army. The most powerful, best and modern army. That is, as always, first Poland is the power, and enough, we are here not a button and so on, and a moment later we are nervously looking for the eyes of the Americans. Uff, they are, and there’s even more of them recently. What a relief!
25101	31	Here, however, it is enough to remind that even at the end of last year, having U.S. intelligence findings about the approaching Russian aggression to Ukraine, PiS went with the Americans to war on TVN. Because party internal goals were more important to President Kaczynski than good relationships with our potential main defence.
25101	33	PiS is not only unable to conduct foreign policy, because in the diplomatic service there are the same unsuccessful people as in any other seat taken by the party. It is also because it represents a party interest over the righteous state. Those who breathe with relief that PiS stood on the right side after February 24, let’s not forget that this war is a “political gold” for PiS. 
25101	35	This is seen in attempts to militarize the public debate, which is intended to draw the attention of the public from the wrath and other pain. The fact that one Lech Kaczynski correctly predicted Russian plans does not mean that PiS learned anything or understood it. It remains to hope that history will never test their effectiveness as Rydza-Smigly tested. 
25102	1	Call the karavan. Greta Thunberg killed by the arguments of those who throw their hole by ecology
25102	3	The youth forum Youth4Climate in Milan was an opportunity for Grety Thunberg to come back. This time, we didn’t hear a teenager. I feel that a serious leader of the new generation is born.
25102	5	As Hamlet spoke “Words, Words, Words” Greta Thunberg from the first words hit the world leaders and they have been saying for years empty phrases about fighting climate change. Bla, bla, bla, bla with the famous words about plans, climate neutrality, ambitions - this is the only thing we hear from their mouths.
25102	7	How much is the truth in her words. Those who track all the information about the climate economy and the emerging in the world and the new effects of climate change are well aware of what Greta Thunberg had to mean.
25102	9	In the last two decades, a kind of innovation has emerged, which has become an obligatory element in the press communications by industry representatives and governments of many countries.
25102	11	There are no more communications in which there is no reference to climate change. Almost every large enterprise feels obliged to ensure that it aims to minimize or even eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, by 2040 or 2050. But as Thunberg notes, these are beautiful words that do not follow any acts.
25102	13	What is important, Thunberg has concrete evidence to support his thesis about the hypocrisy of power.
25102	15	We have been talking about climate protection for years. At the same time, the data indicate something exactly the opposite: half of all emissions in the atmosphere have been generated over the last 30 years. A third in the last 15 years. At the same time, we used to the newbie talking about carbon emission reduction plans.
25102	17	Very often the phrase “We’ll follow X or Y by 2030” represents for companies a carte blanche for no action here and now. “Therefore, we have declared to reduce emissions by 2030, so if you ask us in 2031 and now give us peace.”
25102	19	The situation is dramatic now, here and now.
25102	21	Greta Thunberg acknowledges that we currently have no technology that we could simply move on to not disturb the economy and at the same time drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
25102	23	However, this does not mean that we should work on these technologies and, in the meantime, do nothing. If we don’t have technology it’s hard. We need to change our lifestyle in order to maximize emissions now, giving scientists a few more years to develop technologies that will allow us to move to a zero-emission economy. Anyone will have to bear those costs. If we carry them now, they will be many times lower than if we take them in a decade or two.
25102	25	Will it be uncomfortable? of course. Will people get angry? as much. No one likes how he gets the comfort he’s used to. However, this comfort cannot be more important than the fate of future generations, who instead of enjoying life, will fight with the effects of our egocentrism. They will no longer have a choice, because they will be born in a world destroyed by our ignorance.
25102	27	Greta Thunberg knows what she says
25102	29	Just look at the reactions after Grety Thunberg's speech. The fact that the eighth-year-old says a brutal truth is not pleased by the majority of society, which is why people largely give up in the comments. The problem, however, is that it is right, not the majority of society.
25102	31	Hearing Grety Thunberg's speech, I see, however, that in a few years she was very evolving. The broadcast is more transparent, the noise of trembling is no longer sounded, and the hard noise of disgrace for the hypocrites in corporate governments and politicians who together destroy the Earth’s atmosphere, while throwing out further statements about the intentions to eliminate emissions for one or another year. Moreover, the event was also hosted by the organizers of the event, the Italian government.
25102	33	I have no illusion about whether the words of Grety Thunberg go into the consciousness of the rulers. It will only end up with further statements. Then everyone will go home, and companies will continue to do the same as they increase CO2 emissions.
25102	35	However, this does not change the fact that from year to year we will be oriented into how serious – in the context of the climate – situation we are. When we pay increasing compensation for the losses caused by natural disasters that are the direct consequence of climate change, we will definitely begin to act. Only one question remains open: will it be too late?
25103	1	Where is Greta Thunberg? “We will not wait until he says something.”
25103	3	The youth Climate Strike was at the peak of popularity, attracted millions of people to protests when suddenly a pandemic exploded and it was transferred to the internet from the streets. Then the new platform for meetings became Zoom.
25103	5	The online meetings were attended by activists from Europe and the United States, but also from Africa, Asia and South America. “This was the first time I finally met people from climate movement from other parts of the world. During these meetings we were able to talk to activists and activists from Uganda, the Philippines and India — people who have not been heard so strongly as people from Europe. We then began to discover that for people from those countries where climate change is already very affected, it is not a struggle for the future, but for saving what remains. Dominika Lasota from the Youth Climate Strike in Poland.
25103	7	Miti Jonelle Tan, an activist from the Philippines, said in an interview with Politico, “We are not only struggling for our future, we are struggling for our present.” Disha Ravi, an Indian activist, recognised that the ecological movement was “white,” and thanks to Zoom, she and Mitzi were able to expose their colleagues and colleagues their ignorance towards the poorest countries.
25103	9	“We have a climate crisis associated with ecology, environmental devastation, but for my fellow Uganda, the climate crisis is much greater – it is the result of decades of its country’s colonization by European states, it is the result of racism, through which its ancestors received cultural capital, and ultimately – it is the continuous experience of further harvesting the natural resources of Africa,” says Dominica Lasota.
25103	11	“If not these online meetings, where the borders of nations were not a barrier, the youth movement would not gain all those perspectives that are outside Europe—except being a white man in a privileged, secure country. As a movement we have discovered that the climate crisis is de facto one of the effects of wider social injustice — the revival of different states and communities by the “western” states and corporations — acknowledges the activist.
25103	13	Differences in approach to climate change, due to socio-economic and racial factors that broke out among the activists in Zooma, confirms Yale University’s 2019 and 2020 study. They are more concerned about climate change than people with white skin color; in this case, one person on two.
25103	15	In the wave of talks by activists on social injustices, the Youth Climate Strike decided to add another one to its proposals: climate justice. The new proposal, in addition to the demand of the states to conduct climate policies and transform the economy to reduce greenhouse gases, is now the main priority of the Strike.
25103	17	It is often said that the climate disaster stands in front of all of us, but the climate crisis is not a crisis that we all have contributed equally. Africa is 4 percent. Emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The majority was produced by the United States and Western Europe. But when we look at who feels the most of these effects, we have the absolute reverse — North America and Western Europe are the least exposed to the impact of climate change, and Africa has measured with them for decades — says an activist from Poland.
25103	19	According to the Global Adaptation Center’s report of 2021, every third African resident (up to 2030) will experience poverty due to climate change.
25103	21	The climate justice proposal means that countries and companies that have contributed to climate change should take responsibility and take action to stop the devastation of nature. First, fuel companies should give up all new investments in fossil fuels. New projects that exploit gas, oil and coal further deepen this crisis. Today, as the Youth Climate Strike, we are conducting a campaign against the French company Total Energies. Total is building its longest pipeline in history in Uganda. We are 2022, different European leaders support the demands to end the fossil fuel era, but despite this, fuel companies — with the support of politicians — continue to work and worse, they are looking for new regions where they will be able to further damage the environment, says Lasota.
25103	23	Greta Thunberg: “You can put your climate crisis in the back”
25103	25	The activist emphasizes that such investments have a negative impact on the climate and further deepen social injustice. “The construction of a new pipeline in Uganda will take some people away from their homes, some will live at the poison when Europe’s people won’t lose anything,” he said.
25103	27	Therefore, the Climate Strike also demands that countries that are already suffering from the climate crisis receive money, some kind of climate repairs, from the countries that exploit it. “And it is not a loan, a form of loan, because something like that would continue to create an inequal relationship between them, only a payment for the damages – for the historical consequences of this terrible system that Western Europe and the United States have built,” she says.
25103	29	Africa No Filter (ANF), an organization that fights stereotypes and negative stories about Africa, conducted in April this year an analysis of the internet media, Twitter posts and Google searches from October and September 2021 in terms of what is written and spoken about Africa. The analysis showed that although Africa is faced with a global climate crisis, there are no African voices in the ecology debate — ecological activists, climate analysts and scientists. Only the European rhetoric on the climate crisis is spread to international media, including Greta Thunberg.
25103	31	"The ""problem"" with the Greece was told by third-country activists during meetings at Zooma. They regret that their voice in the ecology debates is missed when those that are more privileged, like Greta, can say how much they want. A Swedish activist already a year ago, at the Youth Conference in Italy before COP26 (United Nations Conference on Climate Change — etc.red.She said she was a ""selected young man,"" but she added that ""this was given that she was listening."""
25103	33	Greta Thunberg is a white girl from Sweden, one of the most privileged countries in the world, who with her solo climate protests inspired millions of young people to the same. But although it moved millions, it was, in my opinion, treated by many as a famous person, with which it is worth showing. Particularly politicians did everything to have a picture of Gretha, but they did not take what she said seriously. If so, we would not talk about the construction of a pipeline in Uganda, or the European Union would not further fund gas, oil and coal from Russia,” Lasota said.
25103	35	Dominica explains that Greta, after talks at Zooma with activists from all over the world, and especially those from Africa and Asia, decided not to engage in the media. Clearness and clarity communicated within the movement that he did not want to focus all his attention on himself. She acknowledged that our colleagues and colleagues from Uganda or the Philippines will talk better about the climate crisis, because they have to deal with it on a daily basis — that they lack drinking water, that their land is revealed, that they live with a heavy industry that makes us comfortable — the Polish activist explains.
25103	37	Now the aim of the Youth Climate Strike is to make as many climate activists as possible, from the most affected regions of the world, have the opportunity to speak in the media. “We want the people who most experience the effects of the mining fuel industry to be heard as often as possible. We strive to make these people meet with politicians, with people who are responsible for destructive investments in their countries, says Lasota.
25103	39	"Among examples showing how much Greta became a synonym of climate strikes, ""Politico"" mentioned the situation when during one of the ""Fridays For Future"" conferences the camera was all the time targeted to Sweden, although it was not her speaker; he spoke another activist, whom the media did not be interested. Press transmission was simple: no matter what climate activists have to say, it’s important only whether Greta says it."
25103	41	Dominica Lasota acknowledges that the climate crisis existed in the media only when Greta went somewhere and said something or when there were strikes. “Now when Greta is on the side, when he doesn’t want to be the face of climate justice, our media movement is calming,” he said.
25103	43	Nevertheless, Greta Thunberg continues its policy of being backward and this year does not participate in the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Instead, other representatives of the Youth Climate Strike appeared.
25103	45	“While Greta is a little shining, we are still a movement of people who believe that change is possible — with or without Greta. We want our movement not to be treated as part of the interesting story of a girl from Sweden, but to take action against the climate crisis for us. We often repeat in the movement that another world is possible. Because it is. And now we’re creating it – Lasota summarizes.
25103	47	We use the planet too quickly. Five Steps of Grety: How to Pay a Green Loan
25103	49	"The majority of the media mention about Greece comes from November 2021, when also Katarina Tubylewicz, a Swedish writer and translator of literature, published the text ""They begin to have a problem with Gretta Thunberg"" in the weekly ""Politics""."
25103	51	The writer referred to critical voices against Gretta, whose part of society in Sweden complains too much criticism of politics. Greta, starting her climate strike at the age of 15, turned to the politicians and turned all her attention to them, wanting to force them to act on behalf of the climate. This resulted in meetings with the leaders of many countries; she met the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former U.S. President Donald Trump, and French President Emmanuel Macron.
25103	53	Millions of people have joined its attempt to invoke politicians to change, seeing in this hope for change. Now that Greta is convinced that politics will not change anything, some of those people have the impression that in that case the previous actions were nothing, since their initiator has lost hope.
25103	55	“It has a great influence and there are such audiences—in Sweden and not only—who think she should become a mature leader, capable of compromising and conducting politics,” Tubylewicz said during an audition at Tok Fm in November 2021.
25103	57	At present, Greta Thunberg gives itself to know sporadically. In his social media, he mainly publishes photos of weekly climate feasts and protests against the war in Ukraine. The exception is the information about her plans to publish a book about the climate crisis, which she posted on Facebook.
25103	59	"The book ""The Climate Book"" is intended to be a review of the problems and challenges that are facing us as the inhabitants of the Earth. The 19-year-old wants to give a voice to 100 people: experts and activists to whom the struggle for the good of the planet is not strange. Among them were the scientists Katharine Hayhoe, the economist Thomas Piketty, the Kenyan ecologist Wanjira Mathai, and the novelist Margerat Atwood, known as the author of ""The Manual Story""."
25103	61	We have used all the resources of the Earth for 2021. From now on we are borrowing.
25103	63	“I decided to use my platform to create a book based on the best and currently available scientific data—a book that holistically discusses the climate, ecological and sustainable development crisis,” Thunberg wrote in a statement. “Climate crisis is, of course, only a symptom of a significantly greater sustainability crisis. I hope this book can be a guide that will help you understand these different, closely connected crises.”
25103	65	The book will be released in the UK at the end of October, and in the United States at the beginning of 2023.
25103	67	"The 19-year-old Swedish is a climate activist with Asperger. In 2018, she started a ""school strike to the climate""; instead of going to school classes, she appeared every Friday under the building of the Swedish parliament, calling on politicians to take action against negative climate change. The aim was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere."
25103	69	After solo strikes and after the attitude of the teenager turned around the world media, the girl grew up as a global climate activist. In the same year she began the protest, she was invited to the climate summit in Katowice and initiated the Youth Climate Strike. In 2018, Time posted her on the list of the 25 most influential teenagers in the world, and a year later she became the youngest Person of the Year.
25104	1	by Greta Thunberg. Climate symbols without meaning [COMMENTARY]
25104	3	While the young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg focuses on the attention of the media and society around the world, her activity is practically irrelevant in terms of climate protection.
25104	5	Greta Thunberg knows almost the whole world. This Swedish teenage girl flattered with her Friday climate weights – she left school classes to protest alone in front of the parliament in Stockholm for the protection of the planet. In just a few months, the girl has become a global icon for ecologists and activists who want to stop climate change. Greta spoke before the parliaments, at the world economic forums, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and a few days ago, on the boat of a steam yacht, she went on a trip through the Atlantic to participate in the climate conferences in New York and Santiago.
25104	7	It should be acknowledged that this is a pretty impressive list of achievements as for a sixteen-year-old.
25104	9	However, from the point of view of the main goal of Gretha – the rescue of climate – its activity remains unimportant all the time. Sometimes it can even hurt the whole matter.
25104	11	The author of these words is aware of the anger and anger that they may cause, but he hopes that the readers will dominate at least while reading this article. Then they can get angry and angry on their will. In addition, the author would like to emphasize at the beginning that there is no so-called “Climate denialists,” on the contrary: climate change considers the greatest challenge faced by mankind. And that’s why, among other things, she sees Mrs. Thunberg’s anger and laidness, and even the dark side of all the confusion she has caused. So let’s go to things.
25104	13	Children, go and play with the soldiers.
25104	15	In her speech at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos, Greta said: “I don’t want hope (...), I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And only then I want you to act. I want you to act as if you were in a crisis. As if our house was burned. It burns.”
25104	17	It is hard to disagree with the diagnosis. In fact, the pace of the occurrence of climate change, their scope and strength lead to the mind of the metaphor of the burning house. Humanity has been aware of this for years. The world leaders gain knowledge about this, even from the activities of the Intergovernmental Panel on Ds. Climate Change (IPCC), which regularly publishes reports indicating the need for extensive action in this field.
25104	19	The UN Climate Summit (COP) is held in Katowice each year. Climate protection was intended to serve such international documents as the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. The U.S. Pentagon is regularly preparing developments to analyze the impact of climate change on global security. The Pacific Islands are regularly calling through their diplomatic channels for increased efforts to protect the climate, as its changes pose a direct, existential threat to those countries.
25104	21	Humanity is aware of the seriousness of the climate problem. Why is there no solution to this issue on the horizon? Why has the world emitted more and more carbon for almost 40 years? Why are new carbon power plants built throughout the planet and the efficient and clean nuclear units are shut off?
25104	23	Well, probably because – as history shows – dealing with great affairs is not easy and takes time. This is an example of the so-called Ozone hole, a phenomenon of decline in ozone concentration in the stratosphere, caused by the use of CFC-12 freon for production, etc. Aerosols, refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.
25104	25	This problem was signaled by science in the early 1980s and has since been combated by the international community. In 1985, the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer was passed, two years later, the Montreal Protocol was signed, through which all the United Nations member states introduced restrictive emissions limitations (which in turn allowed to reduce production of some of them by 90%, the decline also affected CFC-12 - the commitment to exhaust its production, by 2012 its emissions dropped five times).
25104	27	Only recent studies have shown that the ozone hole disappears, and its “depletion” may occur in the second half of the 21st century (unless anyone breaks out of the legal stricts established in this matter). Therefore, it can be said that resolving a relatively simple matter (which requires “only” the withdrawal of a particular substance and the replacement of it with a different, fully available technology) will take the conscious humanity less than a hundred years.
25104	29	Climate change, as mentioned above, is the biggest challenge faced by humanity. The weight of this problem is based on its complexity, its profound roots in the structure of the modern world, its incredibly widespread network of connections and dependencies that make the entire global civilization standing in positions if it takes a slow and rapid move in the wrong direction. Therefore, you need to explore different paths, counting on the need to take a few steps backward.
25104	31	It’s easy to cry, “Let’s go from the coal!” But it is much harder to say what we have to replace this raw material, how to force countries dependent on its burning, to exhaust their pieces and power plants, how to encourage developing countries not to reach that cheap and easy to extract and storage raw material. And all of the above questions are just the surface of the whole lake of questions to be answered before it begins to work.
25104	33	It took several decades to develop renewable energy to make sure that these powers will not effectively replace conventional units or improve the situation, for example. in African countries. It was needed billions of dollars for the electric car industry to notice that they drive cars with fuel engines only in very wealthy societies or where buyers can rely on enormous remunerations and relief. There were dozens of conferences and climate agreements needed to note that the results of these conclusions have not been effective in reducing global CO2 emissions.
25104	35	The author is of the opinion that the next decades will bring further conclusions and observations on the fight against climate change, for example on the role of nuclear energy or on the commitment to improving the energy sectors of developing countries. He also believes that only the next years, or even generations, will bring a breakthrough in the thinking of fighting climate change and in the fighting itself with this problem.
25104	37	"Today, however, we are in a powerful impasse, which is proof of the global CO2 emissions chart. Panic is not a good solution. Meanwhile, Greta has a style of conversation about climate change, which can be well described by the words of Gintrow's ""Autoportet of the Witcher"": I'm afraid of the world's mistakes. To improve mood. I am as a child in a dark closed room."
25104	39	The issue is further complicated by the fact that the climate issue has been well included in the framework of the current political games. The planet protection slogan often serves more as a party slogan to be a sincere declaration of taking real action. In this field, the example of Germany is especially bright, which – under the plate of “green” transformation – shut down its efficient nuclear power plants and strives to prevent the creation of new units of this type in the European Union. “Panicated” activists and people who are in the heart of the good climate can easily catch the beauty of this type of ecomaskirowek.
25104	41	If after reading this paragraph someone still believes that the recipe for the above problems is the figure of a 16-year-old activist, then it is worth to go to a rather distant past and call the person of Samanthy Reed Smith, an American student who in 1982 (when she was 10 years old) wrote a letter to Juri Andropov, sharing her fears about the nuclear war between the United States and the USSR.
25104	43	Samantha quickly became famous, gained interest in the world media, visited the Soviet Union, wrote a book and was called “the ambassador of peace.” The girl did not survive the end of the Cold War, died in an air crash in 1985, but even her supreme supporters are unable to admit that Samantha contributed really to the collapse of the Soviet bloc or the end of the battles between Moscow and Washington. What happened after 1989 was the result of a widespread policy, consistently conducted by the United States and its allies, shifted and improved for decades, and enveloped by the brilliant program developed by President Ronald Reagan and his administration.
25104	45	Who knows how the fate of the world would come if the U.S. government was listening to the voices of various groups who, according to their top ideas, wanted to do “love and not war” and called for, among other things. to extensive nuclear disarmament.
25104	47	Efficiency requires a quiet, subtle and detailed consideration of all circumstances, a lot of trials and experiences, the improvement of methods and the ability to predict errors.
25104	49	Nothing new
25104	51	“It’s okay,” said one of the group’s supporters. “The girl may not affect politicians, but it will raise voters’ awareness about climate change, and they’ll already choose the right people, or they’ll start doing something about it.” Unfortunately, there is a lot of evidence that increased awareness of certain dangers or harmful effects of certain actions does not turn to their reduction, fighting or avoiding.
25104	53	For example, you can use obesity and overweight. In Europe, almost everyone who graduates from primary school realizes that these accidents have a devastating effect on health and life. It is also common to know about the causes of these conditions, such as poor diet or lack of movement. Information about proper nutrition and the need to take care of fitness comes not only from the school education process, but also from the media, pop culture or social campaigns.
25104	55	In addition, almost every packed food product has an energy value expressed in calories on its packaging, making it easier to balance the diet. Therefore, it can be stated with full responsibility that the awareness of the causes, significance and effects of overweight and obesity is very broad. Unfortunately, it is in no way translated to combat these coincidences – according to the European Commission, the percentage of society facing weight problems is growing dramatically in the vast majority of the EU countries.
25104	57	Similar things happen with other factors directly affecting people’s lives and health. The general awareness of the harmfulness of smoking did not eliminate this imposition in societies, the same scenario met the general awareness of the harmfulness of alcohol abuse. Every driver asked on the street would confirm that he is aware of the dangers that it and other road users drive under the influence of alcohol, and despite that the police arrests thousands of car users every year, and those who failed to stop in time, hurt and kill themselves and others.
25104	59	So if people, even though they realize the harm of their own actions, are able to cause harm or danger directly to themselves, is it reasonable to count that they will not cause such harm or danger to the climate?
25104	61	Other Greta supporters assure that her person will move the hearts of hundreds of millions of people around the world, including decision makers, encouraging them to act for the climate. Well, taking these words for a good coin should be admitted that for example. It costs hundreds of thousands of human beings to live in the war in Syria, which they have caused, among others. As a result of climate change, she had a lower potential to “moving the heart” than a 16-year-old girl who now runs through the Atlantic on a luxury racing yacht.
25104	63	Greta, the superhero of Facebook
25104	65	Climate Affairs is a comfortable space to meet the needs of the psychic in terms of thinking about yourself as a good person. People want to perceive themselves as wise, honest and good, they want to support great things, increasing their sense of self-value.
25104	67	All this makes the climate becoming more and more a food for slacktivists - people who support a given matter in a simple and unambiguous way, just to improve their well-being by belonging to a given movement. The Slacktivism was the Bring Back Our Girls campaign, run on social media after the kidnapping of 276 Nigerian students by Boko Haram in 2014. Although millions of people around the world have participated in the campaign to post photos with the title of action on the internet portals (including, among others. Michelle Obama, then First Lady of the United States, is almost half of the kidnapped girls are still being sought. 
25104	69	Side Effects
25104	71	The activity of Grety also carries side effects, consisting of removing from the climate issue all those for whom raising a 16-year-old girl to the symbol of climate change seems at least grotesque. Similar influence can also have the creation of an atmosphere of panic around climate change – as Dr. Tomasz Rožek said in an interview with Energetyka24, it is impossible to persuade anyone constantly to the matter with fear.
25104	73	His role in this matter has also been played by the fire of Grety’s defenders in attacking all those who dare to criticize or even doubt the meaning of her activities. The old conspiracy says that the goal sanctifies the means – it is not possible to avoid the impression that in the case of a Swedish activist her top goal has sanctified her herself for life. What Greta does and says can only be spoken in the superlatives themselves.
25104	75	A successful example of this situation is an attack on the editor of one of the German newspapers, who described the Grety's journey by yacht through the Atlantic, saying it is more emissive than the flight by aircraft, because some of the crew will return from America just by airlines, which will have more negative impact on the atmosphere than if Greta had chosen off the ocean by air. Such statements – although supported by evidence – met with the violent and aggressive reaction of readers who beat the journalist in comments under his article and on his social media.
25104	77	Note bene, the facts described by him make the trip of Grety a fairly comic project, which also does not remain without influence on the social reception of the whole event.
25104	79	We need Activism 2.0
25104	81	Let’s summarize, therefore, that the activity of Grety does not push the climate change. The young activist will not represent the process of shut down German nuclear power plants, will not exhaust Chinese carbon power plants, will not solve the energy problems of the Third World countries. Similarly ineffective is this mythical “climate social consciousness”, which sometimes manifests the characteristics of slacktivism.
25104	83	Someone may ask: why do we then engage in any climate activism? However, taking into account the above arguments, from the ground you can assume that nothing can be done, that all efforts are condemned to failure.
25104	85	As mentioned above, the world is in a climate impasse, which will surely be broken down, but in the future and using other means than those used so far, because these are simply ineffective, focused on the parts of the whole. The same goes for activism – those actions that are point-to-point, in the case of individual cities or regions, do not result in extension to a global scale (which does not take the meaning of activity in the microscal).
25104	87	The activity of Grety does not solve this problem. Its movement can serve as an arc that will bring energy and social commitment to the future, to a new form of activism – but it is not applied to it, because the world obviously corresponds to that (ineffective and burning its own potential) form of action. However, it is necessary to keep in mind all the time that the whey is only a means, not a purpose, and in itself it will not be a recipe for climate change.
25104	89	And the formula of effective climate activism, activism 2.0, which is so comprehensive and exhaustive to cope with the mild climate change, is just to be invented. Avoiding the question of effectiveness, which consists in a 16-year-old figure, is not a step in this direction.

25105	7	More than 185 million – this is the Google search engine’s indication when we enter the word “Greta Thunberg”. This number increases with each day. This shows that we are facing a global media phenomenon. No matter what he does, Greta Thunberg is observed and quoted. The media spy words out of her mouth.
25105	9	She is called a climate activist who launched the “Fridays for Future” movement, inspired millions of young people to be more committed to climate change.
25105	11	Greta Thunberg is meeting with the heads of states, speaks at the UN forum, receives awards. It is listed among the 100 most influential people in the world. There are biographies about her, even a book with her speeches. And that’s all at just 16 years old!
25105	13	How is it possible? The oldness of what he says is not new. He continues to emphasize it. They don’t attribute any discovery. Instead, it calls on people to make what has been known for a long time and what, in her opinion, has already been scientifically learned enough, to finally get to know and take the appropriate steps. So why is she? Where does this media shock come from?
25105	15	The boy from the picture spoke.
25105	17	In the past, there have been times when something was hanging in the air when something was mature. And then on the horizon appears someone who indicates it and who writes it – visible and understandable to everyone. It is as if the spirit of time finds a spokesman. In this case, she is a sixteen-year-old.
25105	19	She is young and looks younger. When he speaks to us, he looks at the child’s face. Many people move deeply. Many cultures know this. In the Christian world, it is a child who saves mankind. In Nepal, the chosen girls are honored, to reach maturity, as Kumari – the child of the goddess. The children are innocent and clean. They tell the truth that adults try to ignore or hide. Or, looking from another point, they make the truth become noticeable.

25105	29	Greta Thunberg, however, has another important feature that is responsible for this global hype. It is the master of escalation and simplification. This is a character that he shares with many populists.
25105	31	It is difficult for another field of scientific research that is so complex and inaccurate in its analyses and results as climate research. But in Grety’s speeches, everything is reduced to apparent clarity and simplicity, as if it were about the principles of Newton’s dynamics.

25105	35	“Start finally listening to the scientists,” he calls, as if there was no one among them and those who perceive the climate problem in a slightly more complex way. Greta Thunberg will put the world in only two colors – black and white, everything between is rejected. There are radical answers to complicated questions. Calls for action, here and now. No time to think or doubt. “Don’t think about it, just act, our house is burning!” – this is a message that everyone understands.
25105	37	Greta Thunberg has a clear and insightful message. The same goes to Twitter. Optimal for the media world, loving crying titles and demanding simplifications. This makes it so effective.

25108	5	Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has become the world’s most famous climate activist. The media does not want to write who is behind it.
25108	7	On the “Time” cover next to her photo stands: “The teenager who strikes for the planet.” The Guardian called it “a breakthrough of hope,” and The New Yorker noted that thanks to the young Swedish “climate changes have become the topic of daily conversations.” The magazine “ID” on the first page wrote about Greece: “The Girl Who Changed the World.”
25108	9	In June, “High Obcasach” was also on the cover with the alarming title “Our house is burning.” The text is similar to many others in foreign media – about how the 15-year-old Greta Thunberg actually launched the worldwide climate defense campaign. The author writes: “There is no staff of people who would help her in the daily tasks of the most influential eco-activist in the world. They need the help of their parents.”

25108	17	“I got the zinc,” explains Ingmar Rentzhog, a Ds expert. Communications and PR, which was the first through social media to inform the world that on August 20, 2018, the 15-year-old Greta Thunberg started school strike for climate. “I thought it would be a big demonstration, and it was sitting alone under the parliament,” Rentzhog says. The Swedish Influencer of the Year in the Environment.
25108	19	He does not want to disclose the source of his information. On the day of the first school strike, Grety Ingmar Rentzhog in a personal Facebook post about the survival of a “emotional morning.” He describes that just with heart pain he left his three-year-old son in the new school, and going to work, he met under Riksga (Swedish parliament) a girl “only protesting against the whole world.”
25108	21	“At the time I was there, only one passenger took a ticket from her. No one except me was talking to her. This is the way anyone who understands that we are facing a burning climate crisis. Everyone around me lives as usual, but the world will soon break down. What does it mean to pretend that nothing is happening? Greta is right. Get together for courage. Come to Parliament. Talk to Gretha and show that she’s not alone. She needs your support,” Rentzhog called. Effect: approximately 10,000 the favourite.
25108	23	The post was attached to three pictures of the sad Gretha holding a transparent with the “School Strike for Climate” and the hashtag #WeDontHaveTime – this is used by Rentzhoga’s foundation and the We Don’t Have Time foundation. Their goal is to build “the world’s largest social media platform on climate issues.” It will allow participants to exchange views, track trends, and entrepreneurs to promote environmentally friendly solutions.
25108	25	The world will learn about Greece on the same day, e.g. We Don’t Have Time is a 38-second film that tells the teenager about her action in the parliament. For foreign media, professional media information is also available on the Medium.com platform. The following day, Rentzhog wrote with enthusiasm on his Facebook page: “School strike has been one of the most effective methods to spread knowledge about climate issues not only in Sweden but also in the world.” His first post on Greece has reached 1 million users on social media.

25108	31	Fear of climate change appeared at Grety Thunberg after watching a school educational film about the Great Pacific Waste Flame. She was eight years old, depressed, stopped eating and going to school. Worried parents long sought help, visiting dozens of medical offices.
25108	33	My mother and father are important in this story. Malena Ernman is an opera singer and singer (represented Sweden at the Eurovision), and Svante Thunberg is an actor and producer. Ingmar Rentzhog complains today that that memorable day of the strike Grety didn’t know anything about her parents. He also says he didn’t know about the book “Scenes from the Heart” published just a few days earlier by the Grety family, which is their personal manifest for climate rescue.
25108	35	It is in this book that parents openly acknowledge that the refusal to eat and the significant weight loss of their daughters was the reversal point that initiated the ecological revolution in the family. The state of Ernman-Thunberg describes how all the four (Greta has a younger sister, Beat) stopped using single packaging, buying new, unnecessary things, and flying on aircraft. Under the influence of the daughter, the parents also bought an electric car and went to vegetarianism.
25108	37	From the book you can also learn that the climate movement that Greta started was invented by her father Svante Thunberg. A few years ago, he accused his acting career of publishing articles and giving lectures on the climate crisis. While in London with her younger daughter Beat, Svante observes tourists from all over the world making selfie at the Tower Bridge and “drinks of a climate movement that’s not yet, because it just has to be formed.”
25108	39	In the book there is also information that Greta can’t normally attend school because she was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. The fact that despite these burdens, and even thanks to them, the young Swedish struggles for the good of the planet, has taken the media.
25108	41	The first protest of Gretta in the second half of August. The school year began in Sweden and occurred shortly after the biggest forests burned in this part of Europe for years. It was the final of the election campaign to the Swedish parliament. Initially, the action was to have a local dimension and last until the day of the elections, that is, September 9, 2018. This procedure helped interest the Swedish media, which, looking for original pre-election topics, quickly appeared on the site. Photographs of Grety’s strike strike around the world.
25108	43	Initially, there was no talk about the famous parents of Gretha or the book published by the Ernman-Thunberg family. In the public TV SVT material appeared information that the girl's father refuses to speak in front of the camera. He didn’t want to answer the question if his daughter should not be in school at this time. He only urged the media to focus on climate threats.
25108	45	On the contrary to the announcement, Greta Thunberg will not end his action after the autumn parliamentary elections. On Facebook, Twitter and Instagram (this day has hundreds of posts, millions of observers) she began to inform that from now on she will strike under parliament every Friday.
25108	47	Her posts are regular and quite professional as for a 15-year-old. A number of protests occur outside Stockholm, among others. In Helsinki, Copenhagen and Berlin, an activist arrives everywhere by train or train. He is in Vienna with his great fan Arnold Schwarzenegger. On another photo, she is covered by Al Gore, the real pioneer of the climate struggle, as the signature announces. Hundreds of lakes also collect photos of Gretha with her two labradores. Many reports show that despite the strike, the teenager urgently learns. When on Friday 17 May she appears before parliament only afternoon, under the photo she reports that that day she had an examination at school.
25108	49	The goal of Gretha is to implement the provisions of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. To ensure this, the young activist and her father take a train to the December COP24 climate summit in Katowice. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres. On social media profiles, the teenage posts her photo on the background of the conference logo and a video with her own speech.
25108	51	In Sweden, on the other hand, a number of students are joining the parliamentary Grety action on Friday, but it’s hard to talk about mass weights. All classes are under the care of teachers. In the coming weeks, the representatives of other professions will be joined in the framework of solidarity. In Stockholm, the parliament has the motto: “Musicers for the Future”, “Princesses for the Future” or “Designers for the Future”. Many people come with their own table just for a moment to make selfie.
25108	53	The frequency is different. Some five people are literally striking.
25108	55	In the world of social media, protests are growing, and the integrating hashtags #ClimateStrike and #FridaysForFuture are emerging.
25108	57	Politicians
25108	59	Meanwhile, when Greta is not striking, she visits the World Economic Forum in Davos, telling billionaires that they’d be arriving there by private rebuilders. He goes to the Vatican where he meets Pope Francis. He speaks in the European Parliament and in the British Parliament. Its activity is observed. The young activist is nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (the Nobel Peace Prize). Norwegian parliamentarians), and the weekly “Time” puts her on the list of the most influential teenagers in the world.
25108	61	The Fridays For Future Movement has the ambition to combine all the events organized in the world to the Grety action model. On FridaysForFuture.org you can report your own demonstration, learn how to organize the protest and what to write the passwords. Read the words of Gretha. On 24 May, a million people from 131 countries and 1851 cities participated in the protest. The event is known as the Youth Climate Strike. Each month, the so-called Global strikes, then the action is accompanied by marches and concerts. Unfortunately, before the European Parliament elections.
25108	63	“Grety Effect” – according to commentators, the results of those elections, in which the Green Party group achieved unexpected success, gaining 40 percent. increasing the number of mandates (69) and significantly increasing its impact on EU climate policy decisions. In Western and Northern Europe, women and young people were mostly voting for the Greens. These groups are visible in the demonstrations organized on the pattern of the Grety Thunberg action.
25108	65	– Demonstrations, photos with famous people, but also private photos with dogs. Her social media profiles contain everything that allows her to go with her on a journey aimed at saving the Earth, says Emanuel Karlsten, a well-known Swedish media analyst. According to the expert, the strongest side of Grety is controversial uncompromising. His attitude causes interactions. It seems impossible to only use trains or not take your luggage with you, says Karlsten.
25108	67	GREAT
25108	69	Ingmar Rentzhog, in a press interview, does not hide that the We Don’t Have Time Foundation – like Grety – is aiming to put pressure on politicians. However, the way of the pineapple and teenage girls split in February of this year, when the newspaper “Svenska Dagbladet” reveals an article revealing that Rentzhog used a young activist to earn 10 million crowns from investors for the development of his business. In the broadcast prospectus, the name Thunberg is listed up to 11 times as the big asset of the company. Greta Thunberg since October. She has become a youth adviser to the We Don’t Have Time Foundation, which is the main investor of the company with the same name.
25108	71	There was no conflict between us. Just Greta informed that in connection with the development of her business there is no time for us – explains me the end of the collaboration Ingmar Rentzhog. She explains that the prospectus is a legally required document in which she could not hide her relations with Gretta and she did not receive any remuneration. “I have not created it, nor have I used it,” he says.
25108	73	"On the other hand, Svante Thunberg in an interview with the ""Svenska Dagbladet"" regretted that the name of his daughter was used for commercial purposes. “We didn’t know about it. The relationship between the foundation and the company should have been more transparent to us,” he said."
25108	75	After the publication of the article, Greta Thunberg issued a long statement written in English. The activist said she “will dissolve rumors about her person and school strike to be able to focus on science.” She explained that in May 2018 she was the winner of the competition organized by “Svenska Dagbladet” for the best article on climate protection. Interestingly, she said that after his appearance he contacted her, m.in. The environmental activist Bo Thorén, who had to propose several different actions. I liked the idea of a school strike. I tried to encourage others to protest, but no one was interested. “When I told my parents about my plans, they were not happy. They said that if I had to do it, I would have to do it myself, without their support,” she wrote.
25108	77	He also said he started his strike in the parliament. “The first thing I did was to post news about the strike on Twitter and Instagram, and it soon became a viral,” she said. According to her version on the site, journalists quickly appeared, and one of the first people arrived was the climate movement entrepreneur Ingmar Rentzhog. “I’ve never met him before or talked to him. No one stands behind me. Beyond me,” she emphasized.
25108	79	The activist also explained that her strike started in August 2018 was not intended to promote the book published by the family. “This book was supposed to be published in May, but the conflict led to a delay in publishing and a change in publishing,” she added, adding that the potential profits from the sale will be allocated to ecological organizations, animal protection and mental health.
25108	81	Supporting
25108	83	The book “Scenes from the Heart”, published in Sweden by Polaris, quickly became a bestseller. On the cover of the first edition was seen the face of singer Malena Ernman, the rest of the family members were mentioned as co-authors. In the second edition, instead of the mother, there is already a photo of Gretha sitting under parliament. In the Danish edition (the book was published in nine countries) the name of Greta Thunberg was also highlighted, making the impression that she was the only author.
25108	85	After an article in the “Svenska Dagbladet” revealing the relations of Grety with Ingmar Rentzhog, the Ernman-Thunberg family is trying to avoid partnerships with the PR industry. He refused m.in. Acceptance of the Grece and Fridays For Future Titan Awards awarded by the Swedish Association of PR agencies and advertising offices Komm. Gretha was appreciated for “innovative communication that inspired people.” In response to the rejected decision of the family, Komm President David Orlic wrote in a letter to Gretta: “This resignation shows our industry what the new generation of citizens and consumers are expecting. We see you, we hear and we admire you.”
25108	87	Journalist Andreas Henriksson, a freelancer who was the first to write about the relations of a PR guru with an activist, believes there is nothing wrong in using PR activities. It is a modern way of forming public opinion. I don’t understand why the family of Grety and Rentzhog tried to hide cooperation. Per because it’s easier to “sale” the movement that has grown from the bottom?” – he wondered in a conversation with TV SVT.
25108	89	So does Greta Thunberg not use the help of professionals at all? Not completely. Helena Iles from the three-person Iles PR agency, which previously worked with Polaris, TV SVT and media tournée of Swedish stars, is responsible for the adolescent’s contacts with the media.
25108	91	There is no PR campaign. I’m working charitable – I complain in a conversation with “Press” Helena Iles. At the demonstrations, he instructs a teenager where to approach and how to set up to photographs. David Fopp, a scientist at the University of Stockholm, works with Gretha and her father. “I’m a bit like a protector,” he said. However, his research shows that he deals with the methods of directing work with children.
25108	93	Media analyst Emanuel Karlsten proves that the Grety message is consistent and sees the work of professionals in it. It’s hard to disagree with her that there’s no sense to go to school when the future of her generation is in danger. This statement provokes and makes you think. It shows that we can’t really delay anymore, says Karlsten.
25108	95	My speaker calls the phenomenon of Friday strikes “a digital movement without precedent.” But there must be a social movement. To succeed, not just a cynical strategy is enough. Climate protests, like the former workers’ and triangular movements, have evolved because their leaders identified the problem, proposed a solution, and came to the people.
25108	97	foundation
25108	99	Ingmar Rentzhog has successfully developed the We Don’t Have Time platform. Available on the internet and in the form of a phone application allows the user for a free promotional campaign of their content after getting the first hundred positive emoticons. After the break with Gretha we don’t have time she financed among others. The May Rossen action is based on the conviction of 100,000. People to submit a declaration of resignation from aircraft travel by 2020. This campaign was also promoted during school strikes.
25108	101	Greta is 16 years old and is a minor. In Sweden, the Fridays For Future movement has no legal status, it is only an informal network that connects associations and individuals. Administratively, it is supported by the non-governmental organizations Klimatsverige and Klimatriksdagen that operate in the same area, with no greater success.
25108	103	What will the future of Grety and her Friday strike movement be? “We are committed to founding the foundation, but my daughter will decide everything,” says Svante Thunberg.
25108	105	For now, the teenager is planning to stop school for a year. He will visit New York in September for the UN Climate Summit and in December for the COP25 in Santiago, Chile. Both trips will be carried out without using a plane.
25108	107	On Monday 23 September, Greta Thunberg at the UN Climate Summit sharply criticized world leaders. I shouldn’t be here. I have to be in school on the other side of the ocean. And yet you come to us, young people, with hope. How do you laugh? “You stole my dreams, my childhood with your empty words,” she said. His speech was quoted by the world’s largest media.
25109	1	“There is a need for drastic action because the world is burning.” Apel by Grety Thunberg
25109	3	"Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg convinced on Friday at the evening in Glasgow that it is necessary ""nathetic and drastic"" reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to stop climate change, because ""the world literally burns."""
25109	5	On Friday in Glasgow, where the UN Climate Conference COP26 takes place, a young people’s march was held calling for more determined action in the fight against climate change. The March was organized by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group founded by young people inspired by the Thunberg school strike, and was the largest until now accompanying COP26 demonstration; according to British media, about 10,000 were involved. people.
25109	7	“The leaders do nothing.”
25109	9	It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure. It should be obvious that we cannot solve the crisis by the same methods that have previously influenced us. We need immediate drastic annual emissions cuts, unlikely to anything the world has ever seen - convinced 18-year-old Thunberg on the scene lifted up on George Square in Glasgow, who was the target of the march.
25109	11	Greta Thunberg criticizes the way the pandemic is fighting. “Vaccine Nationalism”
25109	13	“People at power can still live in their baths filled with their fantasies, such as unlimited growth on a limited planet and technological solutions that suddenly don’t know where they will come from, and that will eliminate all these crises. And all this is in a time when the world literally burns, stands in fire, and when people living on the first line continue to bear the burden of the climate crisis,” she said.
25109	15	She described the UN Climate Summit as a “two-week festival of what is usual, and bla, bla, bla” to “to keep everything unchanged” and “to create legal gap to benefit themselves.” Leaders do nothing. It seems that their main goal is to continue the struggle for the status quo. We know that our emperors are hopeless, she said.
25109	17	Participation of Activists
25109	19	Talks about how climate change already affects their homeland have also been announced by activists from several other countries. One of the performances was Vanessa Nakate from Uganda. In history, Africa is responsible for only 3 percent. Global emissions, and yet the African people most feel some of the most brutal effects of the climate crisis. But although the global south is on the frontline of the climate crisis, it is not on the first pages of the world newspapers, she said.
25109	21	Grety Thunberg Monument in front of the University. Students opposed
25109	23	Friday was the COP26 day of youth and NGOs, but the climate movement took place regardless of the event. His participants and young climate activists claim that their voice is not taken into account at all; as evidence, they indicate that Thunberg was not invited to the conference and came to Glasgow as a private person.
25109	25	On Saturday in Glasgow there will be another climate march – much greater, as it is expected to take part in several thousand people, to whom Thunberg will speak again. In parallel, climate marches will take place in London, other British cities, as well as in about 200 cities around the world.
25109	27	The COP26 climate conference, which Thunberg declared failed a few days ago, will last until Friday, November 12.
2511	1	The war in Ukraine is a drama of people and a threat to the environment.
2511	3	Although, without a doubt, the biggest drama of the war in Ukraine is the suffering of its inhabitants, experts warn that Russian aggression also carries serious environmental risks.
2511	5	More than 1,000 experts and humanitarian organizations in the field of environment and international law have published an open letter expressing their solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The signatories of the letter also highlighted their concerns regarding the threat the conflict brings to the environment both of Ukraine and Europe.
2511	7	Experts noted that as a result of the Russian aggression on Ukraine, toxic materials from destroyed buildings, explosive pipelines and damaged sanitary systems and fuel and chemicals are released into the air, soil and water.
2511	9	“In armed conflicts human suffering is so great that sometimes it seems unreasonable to think about environmental problems,” said Carl Bruch, director of international programs at the Environmental Law Institute and co-author of the letter. “The truth is, however, that the environmental impact can affect the sources of maintenance and public health, and also kill people by spreading diseases that otherwise would not occur,” Bruch added.
2511	11	The list notes that the impact of war on the environment will surely be long-lasting and difficult to repair.
2511	13	“When we talk about the release of dangerous materials, they are often invisible with the naked eye. So exposure to people who do not participate in the struggle – children and innocent civilians – can last years, if not decades,” said Carroll Muffet, co-author of the letter and president and general director of the International Environmental Law Center.
2511	15	At the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, Russia attacked military facilities, including airports and fuel and ammunition warehouses, causing massive fires emitting heavy metals and other toxic materials.
2511	17	According to the British non-profit organization Conflict and Environment Observatory (CEOBS), which monitors and publishes data on the environmental dimensions of armed activities, the struggles in the Ukrainian Biosphere Reserve of the Black Sea, which is a UNESCO protected area, have caused fires that can be seen from space. CEOBS also confirmed that the actions of the Russians proved their lack of concern for both the civilian population and the environment.
2511	19	According to the signatories of the letter, an attack on a country with 15 active nuclear facilities creates an additional risk of disaster. Although the international law prohibits attacks on nuclear power plants and similar dangerous facilities, the Russians have attacked the power plant, which is the largest such facility in Europe, and have previously undertaken military operations also in Chernobyl.
2511	21	Following the warnings contained in the latest report of the Intergovernmental Team. Climate Change (IPCC), the Russian invasion of Ukraine was described as “a fierce reminder of the vital importance and the urgent need to end the world’s dependence on fossil fuels.”
2511	23	“As oil and gas drive the climate crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine shows how fossil fuels finance, trigger and prolong conflicts around the world. Continuous reliance on fossil fuels is as destabilizing for global peace as for global climate,” said Muffet.
25110	1	The light has already been shut down.
25110	3	The Republic of South Africa is experiencing a strong electric crisis, and the inhabitants are separated from the electricity. The situation is repeated cyclically, but the problems are increasing. The state operator since the elimination of the apartheid has been uninvested, and the company Eskom under the new leadership has not directed profits either to investments or even to proper maintenance of the network.
25110	5	Now, as in 2019, the breakdown in power supply is multiplying throughout the country several times a day. It is also cold there. Each time the exhaust takes a few hours. The public company Eskom has even warned that the residents of the RPA must prepare for at least... 100 days of power supply break in the coming months.
25110	7	The energy RPA is 80% dependent on carbon, which is not just a shortage there. However, most power plants are aging, decapitalized and have not been modernized due to “endemic corruption.” The state company has become a port and a source of financing for progressive politicians, which was visible during President Jacob Zumy's 2009-2018 years.
25110	9	In addition, the company has a strong debt. All this makes it unable to meet the country’s electricity needs today. It also does not help that the RPA energy sector has recently experienced serious strikes of workers demanding salary increases and housing benefits.
25110	11	The RPA government recently received a $7.7 billion aid during the last COP26 in Glasgow for energy transformation. Megawatts were expected to be from wind and solar energy in accordance with the government's plan adopted in 2015 Seven years later, these new sources of energy are not available. Meanwhile, the demand for electricity in South Africa may be reduced by 2040 and the socialism associated with Africanization will always have the same effects.
25111	1	Jewish people flee from Russia in fear of Kremlin plans
25111	3	Together with the crazy war that lasts for the fifth month in Ukraine, and the repressions directed against citizens’ freedoms in the country, Russian Jews fear that they may soon become the target of the Kremlin and will rush away from Russia – describes Politico, stressing that those who decide to stay in the country live in fear.
25111	5	“In our community we’re not talking about politics,” an anonymous Moscow rabin said. Following the 2011 protests related to Putin's re-election, Rabin ordered that politics must be outside the doors of his synagogue.
25111	7	Representatives of the Jewish community were more critical to the Russian invasion of Ukraine than the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Cyril, the Politico portal commented on Monday.
25111	9	Berel Lazar, the head of the rabbin of Russia, called for peace and offered mediation in the conflict. Moscow's deputy rabbin Pinchas Goldschmidt fled the country two weeks after the conflict began due to the pressure imposed by the Russian authorities to express support for the war. He is currently living in Israel and has announced that he does not plan to return to Russia.
25111	11	According to the knowledge of researchers and surveyors, the lives of Russian Jews have improved since the collapse of the USSR in 1991. According to the Levada Center, 45 percent. The Russians said they had a positive attitude towards the Jews in 2021, a 22 percent increase. in 2010. The Russians admitted that Jews are the minority alongside which they feel the most comfortable, but only 11 percent. He said he would be ready to have a Jewish friend, which is a 3% increase. In 2010,” the portal says.
25111	13	Ilja Jablokov, a lecturer at the British University of Sheffield, a specialist in the study of dezinformation and censorship, who took part among others. As an anti-Semitism in Russia, he said anti-Jewish xenophobia could explode at any time if the Kremlin wanted it.
25111	15	In the 1980s and 1990s, the brutal anti-Semitism of politicians was a reaction to the social polarization of Russia. In the 21st century there was economic growth, so the level of anti-Semitism decreased, Jablokov said.
25111	17	As he added, the Kremlin is now choosing the target of other minorities, and the terrorist number one has become the West.
25111	19	It is estimated to be 165 thousand. The Jews lived in Russia in 2019, meaning it was then the sixth largest Jewish community in the world living outside of Israel. In the first three months after the Russian invasion began on February 24, about 10,000. They received Israeli citizenship.
25111	21	In response to the mass migration of Jews, Israel launched a special diaspora immigration program, according to which it can be granted citizenship to people who will prove their relatives are Jews to the third generation back. The waiting time in the local councils was shortened from 9 months to a few weeks. Tel Aviv also allowed refugees to apply for citizenship after they arrived in Israel.
25111	23	Olga Bakusynskaya, a Russian journalist who moved to Israel in 2014 after the annexation of the Crimea, opened a Facebook group to help new Russian members integrate. She said that over the past few months the number of aid requests has “exploded”, and more than 3,000. Russians (and Ukrainians) have joined the group since February.
25111	25	While many Israelis have heartily welcomed new guests, not everyone is friendly. Bakushinskaya said she helped the Russians who were unfaithfully accepted by the elderly Israelis who emigrated from Russia in the 1990s and described new immigrants as “non-Jewish.”
25112	1	What would Oriana Fallaci say about it?
25112	3	The little Italian well knew who she hated and talked about this great voice, so in those few countries where freedom of speech is still valued, her books are published in millions of copies, and in others they are completely humiliated by ordinary fear. The same fear that didn’t allow to publish a certain cartoon, because there will be protests, and maybe something will fly out in the air...
25112	5	Oriana Fallaci, who died in 2006, said that there is now a completely new religion in almost all of Europe, the god of which is political correctness. Anyone who does not recognize this god is automatically convicted. and books as well. If in a country ruled by the fundamentalists of this religion some Fallaci book was imprinted, it would have to be burned immediately. Just such a modern totalism in the skin of a democratic and progressive sheep... Such a democracy, according to the writer, is no democracy.
25112	7	What is this democracy that, instead of listening to citizens, closes their mouths, gives them to the enemy, exposes to abuse and violence? What is this democracy that prefers theocracy, regains the concept of heresy and sends its children to the slaughter? What is a democracy in which a minority counts more than a majority, and counting more than a majority, it is harsh and kidnapped?! This is an anti-democracy, I tell you. It’s a crack, buja. And what is this freedom that prohibits thinking, speaking, going under the stream, rebelling, opposition to the one who invades us, or forcing us to silence? What is this freedom that makes citizens live in fear of being treated and even judged and punished as criminals? What is this freedom that wants to evaluate not only thoughts, but also feelings, and thus to show who I have to love, who I have to hate.
25112	9	Someone who has read Fallaci's book simply doesn't know in what world he lives and will probably never even find out. Per it is for him and better, because he doesn’t have to think himself, he has on the plate a whole easy and affordable worldview explained by the Novom, which, contrary to Orwell’s struggles, dominated today’s language, though not as he predicted. Words such as progress, truth and democracy – and in fact the entire dictionary – do not mean the same today as they meant before Orwell. Thanks to the political correctness, the whole dictionary gained a completely new meaning.
25112	11	Oriana Fallaci has tried to describe the world in that archaic, pre-orwell, unreferred language, which causes a cultural shock, and for many it is completely incomprehensible, or even repressive. But, as she wrote, there is fashion today, or rather foolishness, which, in the name of “Justice”, dissolves the normal words and calls the street workers “eco-workers”, “home-owners”, who rush in schools “non-disciplinary staff”, blind “visually followed”, foolish “audially followed”, bullish “movely followed”, and homosexuality “difference”... Is this not new?
25112	13	Fallaci is criticized – by those who want to criticize it – for the lack of objectivism, for the transversal truth and the sin of panic, that here we are facing the conquest of Europe, to which we gently, masochistically even insist. The Italian writer, even if she gave us only her, not always to the end, “objective truth,” she tried to shake the scenes, forced to open the eyes and name things by name. When we open our eyes and recognize that he is right, then we will have to do something with it, react in some way, because permission, she believes, is equal to collaboration. But she thought there are moments in life, “when silence becomes a sin, and speaking is a commandment, a civil duty, a moral challenge, a categorical imperative, from which there is no escape.”
25112	15	The left-wing Europe is so dependent on the supply of oil from the Middle East or today gas from Russia that it agree on almost everything. This permission for expansion and all the propaganda associated with it seems to be due not only to the left – fascinating black, red, tactile, but also to the Catholic Church, which, by its naive ecumenism, is not enough to tolerate this situation, it is also trying to build bridges between the two cultures.
25112	17	And where unhappy with the forgiveness of the crosses, the Pope will bless them continuously. The Holy Father: Why don’t you remember? Why, in the name of the One God, do you not place your brothers in the interior of the spacious Vatican? Of course, to the condition that they will not joke in the Sykstinian Chapel, that they will not joke on the sculptures of Michael Angel, that they will not shake the painting of Rafael.”
25112	19	This liberal Father was John Paul II.
25112	21	It is clear that the anti-Muslim trilogy written in this style must raise and raise opposition, but also admiration for the courage to express its views, so rare in today’s times. The disgrace of Muslims is quite understandable. They just live the way they think they should live. They are, more or less, guided by guidelines from the Qur’an, and we don’t have much influence on it as it appears... The Islamic Fundamentals, sounding in the world and putting bombs here and there, however, themselves do harm to ordinary Muslims, according to the principle that every cage has two ends. In the West, there are also political groups that want, first, to strengthen the immigration policy, to limit the cultural and religious expansion of Muslims already in Europe, and then... Who knows? The Islamic fundamentalism is damaged by Turkey, which would like to join the European Union, but now has less and less chances. Who will dare to put into Europe a state with the advantage of the Muslim population, people who, thanks to the European passport, could settle anywhere in Europe and build mosques there?
25112	23	Fallaci noted that the Muslim environments in the European countries do not intend to integrate with the societies of the settlement countries, and they want to create their own enclaves, which, in her opinion, are the patterns of expansion, a revanche for the Spanish reconquist and the battle of Vienna. When Muslims were viewed through the prism of the “Thousand and One Night Songs”, through the prism of the mosque in Kordoba, through the prism of the Turkish basars, they still had a chance to gain our sympathy. On the other hand, events such as September 11 or the Spanish and London attacks have worsened the media image of Muslims to the extent that people are just starting to fear them. They are more and more considered to be countless fanatics than the sympathetic descendants of Ali Baby. Finally, the next toms of the anti-Islamic trilogy were the reaction of the writer to the next attacks, starting on September 11 in New York. Each such event only reduces the limit of the tolerance of Western societies to the ideas of building mosques in European capitals, to the reception of further refugees from Iraq.
25112	25	Fallaci wrote his trilogy in a hysterical and unelegant language. In fact, you don’t need to write up to three books to express what she wanted to express. It would be enough for a machine copy card, or even one sufficient curse, or a challenge after every attack. Being a writer, and moreover feeling to be a consciousness of Europe is a commitment. As a result, we received three toms on the same topic, i.e. why Muslims are sturdy and why they should not be brought into Europe. Sometimes you have to trigger a scandal to be noticed, to better advertise your theses, to convince your opinions, a media scandal corresponding to every attack... Italy simply responded with its bombs to terrorist bombs. Her rhetoric in some countries therefore resulted in publication success and a hit “under the shoulder”. Other countries, however, preferred not to be exposed to Islamic protests or even repressions that touched Spain, England, France and, to a certain extent, Denmark after the publication of the cartoon of Muhammad.
25112	27	Intelligence Without Intelligence
25112	29	Muslimism is one thing, and the other, not less important, and even more important, is the attitudes of European politicians who change their views like gloves, are, according to the writer, intellectually limited and ridiculous. But it was always so. Oriana on the fingers of one hand counted historical characters who really had something to say and in a clearly positive way influenced the course of history. The rest are people worthy of contempt, cakes on the roof.
25112	31	One of the allegations directed against the author of the anti-Islamic trilogy was that she did not propose any concrete solutions for how to defend itself, in addition to advertising the problem. Well, it is really a problem with that. Democratic and open Western societies, connected with international agreements, must, whether they want or not, accept refugees from regions threatened by war and political persecution. And so it follows that until recently they were mainly Muslim countries, which, if someone wanted to be evil and took it, themselves create such a situation, such a threat to their own citizens, that it results in the waves of immigrants in Europe... Democratic leaders of Europe can say nothing but what they predict the framework of political correctness, because they are afraid of losing votes. The question of whether the correct rhetoric is just a roof of smoke behind which are hidden reasonable people who seek to find a way out of the situation, or rather, as Fallaci claims, moderations without intellect, and thus any vision. If the advantage is on the side of the latter, then we can pack... Only? Where should we escape?
25112	33	Is the flow of Muslim populations to Europe really a problem? According to Fallaci, if the amount goes to quality, then yes! We all agree that the problem is definitely Islamic terrorism. The burden of all Muslims for Islamic terrorism is the same thought structure as the burden of all Catholics for the activity of the Inquisition. Imagination that all Arabs, Iranians, and Turks are fanatic believers of Muhammad and literally follow the provisions of the Qur’an is the same simplification as the imagination that all Catholics wake up on their mouth with the name of Christ and live according to the guidelines in the Bible. So the question is, is Islam really a threat to Europe, or is it just what it seems to some people in Oriana Fallaci? And is it that the mosque in the center of the city is interfering with us, or is there really something against Islam, and if so, then why? Did Fallaci convince us, or would we prefer to continue reading “Thousand and One Nights”?
25112	35	PS
25112	37	What would Oriana Fallaci have to say? Many would rather not hear it.

25113	1	“LGBT conservationism,” about how the compromising supporters enabled gender revolution
25113	3	Can a gay be a conservative? Nominally so. This is testified by the factions of so-called sexual minorities acting within the parties considered conservative. These “conservative gay” have contributed – even in the UK and the United States – to the liberalization of law and the spread of LGBT anti-cultures. Why was it possible and how did it happen?
25113	5	The term “LGBT conservation” is used in relation to the term “LGBT conservation”. Lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender people with conservative political views. During the first period before Stonewall (hosts in the New York bar of homosexuals called out in 1969 after the police charged), so-called LGBT conservatives accepted and promoted conservative ideas, including critical to homosexual subcultures. They spoke against epating in public spaces with inclinations to the same gender, in contrast to the depravation of young generations, the adoption of children by couples of the same gender, not to mention the equalization of such relations with sacramental marriages. It has been emphasized that fairly homosexuality is treated as an abuse – so far as dangerous – and immoral behavior.
25113	7	After the turmoil, the emphasis was placed on revealing and seeking to affirm a solved lifestyle in different configurations. The “conservation” of homosexuals expressed itself in their support for the government’s limited competence idea or for low taxes. The Sodomists, however, talked for the equalization of single-sex relations with the institution of marriage, for the recognition of the “homosexual family”, for equality for all minorities, and for a positive representation – even an affirmation – through the belief of the homosexual lifestyle. More and more radical “geo-conservatives” demanded the right to adopt children by single-sex couples.
25113	9	Bring us up right now!
25113	11	Decriminalization of homosexuality
25113	13	If we go deeper, we can see that the change of views among the conservatives has progressed with the spread of the illuminating heresy. First of all, the focus is on the decriminalization of homosexual acts. For example, in France, in 1791, Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau presented a draft of the new Criminal Code, indicating that only “true crimes” should be prohibited, and not “false offences committed by prejudice, feudalism, tax system and [righteous] despotism.”
25113	15	Therefore, the new criminal code proposed by him eliminated the crimes “caused by prejudices”. There was no talk about blasphemy, heresy, sanctuary, wizard, clergy, or homosexuality. The Criminal Code of Napoleon, issued in 1810, did not contain any provisions concerning religious crimes, homosexuality or homosexuality.
25113	17	However, Portugal became even more “progressive” and in 1852 it legalized the sodomic relations. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, before the proof of homosexuality in 1870, only stopped the fear of “public opinion”, which at the time still considered homosexual relations not a “privacy”, but a crime. On May 15, 1871, the German Empire adopted paragraph 175, criminalizing homosexuality.
25113	19	The same happened in the UK in August 1885, under the rule of the conservative Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, when the Labouchere amendment was adopted.
25113	21	However, in the remote Argentina, two years later, during the period of the Conservative Republic, gender relations of people of the same gender were legalized.
25113	23	Great Britain
25113	25	In February 1954, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared that the Conservative Party did not intend to relieve the law against “gays.” He suggested to limit media reports on condemns of homosexuals and the police to offer treatment to every man captured on the present acts.
25113	27	In 2007, Brian Coleman, a former gay conservative member of the parliament and former mayor Barnet wrote in New Statesman that in the mid-50s the London police realized that the future Prime Minister Edward Heath had to allow homosexual acts in public toilets. She warned him to stop, otherwise he would hurt his career. Coleman claimed that homosexuals for many years “managed” the Conservative Party and therefore were protected.
25113	29	Large changes in the worldview of torys occurred after the 1957 Wolfenden Report on the legal situation of homosexuals and prostitutes was published. The report eventually called on the government to decriminalize homosexual acts among adult men who agreed to such activity. It was applied to strengthen the punishment of sodomites and prostitutes who accept sexual acts publicly (it was enough for one person to be witness to obscene acts).
25113	31	In May 1965, Arthur Gore, the leader of the Conservative Party, introduced to the House of Lords a draft law decriminalizing the sexual relations of men of the same sex in England and Wales. The law was passed by the House of Lords in July 1965 and was introduced to the House of Gmin by the conservative deputy Humphrey Berkeley, a famous homosexual. After the Labour Party's victory in the 1966 elections and the loss of mandate by Berkeley, his place as a law sponsor was taken by Leo Abse from the winning Labour Party.
25113	33	In 1967, when a law was adopted to abolish the penalties for homosexual acts, almost all members of the Conservative Party – including the future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher – voted for a new regulation. Eight years later, Peter Walter Campbell founded the first conservative LGBT organization in history, the Conservative Equality Group of Homosexuals (CGHE).
25113	35	If you believe in the suggestions of Coleman, the “gei” and former member of the Conservative Party, many sodomites had to join the British Conservative Party and actively act for the so-called Conservative Party. The rights of homosexuals during Margaret Thatcher's rule. Why?
25113	37	The “Iron Lady” was intended to attract homosexual men “with pure elegance, female perfection, perfect clothing and determination to change society, although her government could even have an anti-Gean aura.” According to Coleman, in Thatcher’s personal attitude there was nothing that could indicate “any prejudice.” The Prime Minister had no problem with the appointment of “geois” ministers, for example. Count Avon (the son of former Prime Minister Anthony Eden). It is her government and Norman Fowler as the health secretary faced the AIDS problem.
25113	39	Coleman moved so far in his claims that he wrote that “there are a lot of gay torys who would like to sleep with David Cameron, but this portrait of Lady Thatcher is on their bed!”
25113	41	In 1980, the Government of the Iron Lady adopted a law legalizing the sexual intercourse of the same sex in Scotland.
25113	43	In 1991, the world’s first “conservative organization” of sexual minorities – CGHE – was transformed into the Torys Campaign for Equality of Homosexuals (TORCHE). A few years later the LGBTory group was formed, which participated actively in the sodomite parades throughout the UK. Over time, LGBTory has been transformed into LGBT+ Conservatives, which is currently working to promote “equality” marriages for representatives of all “sexual orientations.”
25113	45	Besides, of course, the torys party has its official lobby group, the LGBTQ lobby, which is a conservative UK Independence Party (UKIP). Her vice president was the sodomite Peter Whittle.
25113	47	In the UK, the “conservatives” have de facto led to the decriminalization of homosexual acts. It was believed that it was only a “sanitary” regulation of the legal situation of sodomites who have so far been sentenced to prison for co-life with persons of the same sex. With time, the attitude of the conservatives evolved towards the affirmation of a solved lifestyle. Traditional marriage and family were attacked, and the essence of conservation was denied.
25113	49	On October 5, 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron stated at a conference of his party that he supported “homosexual marriages” not “in spite of its conservation,” but “because he is a conservative.” Cameron changed the meaning of this concept, on the contrary, interpreting traditional values.
25113	51	The phenomenon of changing normativity of British conservatives (torys) was observed by Martin Monahan, the author of a scientific article entitled: “Tory-normativity” and gay rights advocacy in the British Conservative Party since the 1950’s. The text was published in the British Journal of Politics and International Relations in 2019. He stated that the openness to the “gays” arose from the adoption of a “pragmatic” attitude and a discreet approach, which with time became the place of celebration and affirmation.
25113	53	Just after World War II, the Conservative Party’s homosexuals introduced the issue of defense. “Gay rights in a form acceptable for the party.” They were not angry and initially did not demand an affirmation of a solved lifestyle. They first proposed the dekriminalization of homosexual acts, calling “health-righteous” arguments.
25113	55	It is not a liberal Labour Party, but conservatives proposed in 1966 a law on the decriminalization of homosexual acts and ultimately it was for the governments of the torys adopted in 2013 a law legalizing the so-called law. pseudonyms of the same sex.
25113	57	Monahan associated with Nottingham Trent University emphasizes that the sodomites within the party did not question conservative ideas, but expanded and extended their understanding.
25113	59	Although formally the rules remained the same, they were interpreted differently and intended to serve new purposes. As the Toronto parliamentarian and thinker Jesse Norman explains (2010), “in ethics [conservation] does not moralize, but works practically.”
25113	61	In the 1950s, when more than 1,000 Sodomic criminals were in British prisons because of sodomy, “conservative” messengers of homosexual dekriminalization pointed out that what adult men do privately – with their consent – can morally be regarded as “their own affair” unless they accept their acts publicly. If they violate “public dignity, then legal intervention could be justified.”
25113	63	The concept is adopted that the foundations of good public order are not derived from law, but from individual responsibility, and society, plays the function of a moral disciplinating force.
25113	65	The “gays” related to the torys pointed out that the moral law must remain stable and condemning, although the law established in order to eliminate the “inpracticity” in the matter may change.
25113	67	They appealed to Christian compassion and a sense of justice for the minority. During the second reading of the law decriminalizing homosexuality, former conservative minister Richard Wood argued that the more behavior is trying to be regulated, the less space is available for individual moral responsibility of the individual.
25113	69	Another argument was that this is not homosexuality is the main threat to the family, but alienity. However, unfaithful spouses are not punished as touchingly as sodomites. This is the reason for the dekriminalization of male homosexuality.
25113	71	In the following years, they were convinced that gay people were “conservative by nature.” Many of them work on their own account or do a successful career in the business. Many people take the burden of paying mortgage loans because they want to own a home and all homosexuals “have a vital interest in ensuring the country’s well-being.”
25113	73	The British nominal conservatives acting for the eradication of homosexuals were closer to libertarianism and neoliberalism rather than conservationism. After all, in the following years, demanding “new rights” for sexual minorities and ultimately not only the acceptance, but the affirmation of a solved lifestyle, they argued that this is the way they fight against the state’s interference in individual freedom.
25113	75	Although Coleman said that many “gayers” had swallowed into the Conservative Party under the Thatcher governments, there was also a group in the party attacked it for a fairly liberal approach in the social sphere, unlike the economic sphere.
25113	77	In 1988, the “Iron Lady” government even introduced a local government law that prohibits the local authorities “to target homosexuality promotion or to publish materials with the intention to promote homosexuality”, to promote the teaching of the so-called homosexuality. Family in a positive light, etc.
25113	79	Then, however, the image of the “gays” began to be created as model citizens, who contribute to the success of the state, do not pose a threat to the family, but can even be “a source of its support.”
25113	81	Since 2004, when Michael Howard allowed parliaments to vote on civil unions according to his own conscience, the Conservative Party has begun a rebuilding: on the one hand it was aboutining the neoliberal fountain of thatcherism, and on the other hand it was aimed at separating from social conservationism. At that time, so-called modernizers appeared, who pushed the torys on the path of progressive agenda. The main reformator was David Cameron launching an “incluential approach to ethnic minorities, women and homosexuals.”
25113	83	The Conservative Party adopted and adopted a law on single-sex marriages. And in the party brochure of 2021 it is stated that rejecting the “gays” of the possibility of marriage and the use of its benefits can be seen as “non-conservative.”
25113	85	Currently, the LGBT + Conservatives group has been strengthened by drawing up new minority proposals.
25113	87	Thus, out of the “practicity” and “discretity”, the British conservatives initiated an ordinary revolution and introduced a far-reaching social change. Everything was possible through the permission to work within a party of disproportionate rebels, first initiating internal debate, and then presenting with the draft laws that fundamentally change the position of sexual minorities in the state.
25113	89	In an analysis entitled “The implementation of same-sex marriages in 2013: the modernization of Cameron’s social agenda in the Conservative Party since 2005,” Stefan Porion wrote that “the breakthrough initiated by David Cameron” was possible with the support of other groups and the determination of Cameron himself, who considered the issue of legalizing so-called homosexual marriages as key to making the torys of the modern party “liberal conservationism”.
25113	91	To transform the party, the new leader isolated the opponents of the LGBT agenda, introduced a strict party discipline, and engaged some to work on exposed positions, binding them with the discipline of collective responsibility. Some were isolated to the end as Baronessa Young, who died in September 2002 Since then, the torys’ opposition to the LGBT lobby in the House of Lords has fallen.
25113	93	According to Philip Lynch, “Cameron’s conservative renewal strategy was largely based on Tony Blair’s strategy when he became the leader of the Labour Party in 1994.
25113	95	Blair, in turn, wrote in his memories that the Torys were under the influence of the New Labour Party, and his generation set a new paradigm: what you do in your personal life is your choice, but what you do to others is no longer. Therefore, there was a distinction between attitudes towards people (non-discriminating due to race, gender or sexuality) and attitudes towards social order. De facto, British conservationism was dominated by liberal ideology.
25113	97	Behind the ocean
25113	99	In the United States, so-called LGBT conservation is characterized primarily by libertarianism in social matters and a focus on fiscal conservation, a limited role of the government.
25113	101	The U.S. has been pushing for a long time for legal changes. Just after World War II – due to the fears that the communists would infiltrate the national security institutions – both conservative and liberal politicians sought to remove homosexuals from administrative and military positions. At that time, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, conducted the Sex Deviants program, forcing sodomites to leave exposed positions.
25113	103	Until the massacres in Stonewall Inn, the atmosphere did not favor the change in the relationship to homosexuality, although, of course, it was present with the aspirations of sexual minority assimilation. The question of their so-called rights was presented as a matter of struggle for civil rights.
25113	105	The paradigm changed in the late 1960s after the revolts in Stonewall Inn, when the LGBT movement worsened the competition between the supporters of the ideology of assimilation and liberation.
25113	107	In 1972, the Gay Activists Alliance of San Francisco was established by the Gay Voter’s League, which participated in a campaign for the re-election of the Republican president Richard Nixon. Finally, in 1978 the Republican Party formed the Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) group, which aimed at fighting the California Briggs initiative that prohibits homosexuals from teaching in public schools. It was supported by then Governor Ronald Reagan.
25113	109	For President Reagan, what is true, no regulations have been introduced. The rights of the gay advanced, and the president himself criticized the “gay race” because he not only demanded civil rights; but he wanted to recognize and accept an alternative lifestyle that neither he nor the American society could tolerate.
25113	111	The changes in this matter began to occur during the presidency of another Republican – George H.W. Bush signed the law on the statistics of hate crimes on April 23, 1990. As the first federal law, it “recognizes and calls gay, lesbian and bisexual.”
25113	113	Again, like in the UK, legal changes in the recognition of sexual minority harassment occurred in the United States, not due to the introduction of them by a liberal party, but nominally conservative.
25113	115	"On November 29, 1990, Bush signed an Immigration Act that removed the term ""sexual devastation"" from the INA Act so that it could not be prohibited for sodomites from entering the United States."
25113	117	Bush changed his rhetoric and said in a television interview that if he learned that his grandson is a gay, he would “love his child” but would tell him that homosexuality is not normal and he would deny gay activism.
25113	119	Just losing in the presidential elections in 1992 for a more right-wing opponent, Pata Buchanana, Bush made a turn to the right and publicly condemned the proposal for “marriage” of people of the same sex.
25113	121	In 1994, George W. Bush, a candidate for the governor of Texas, promised to revoke any attempts to abolish the law on sodomy in Texas, and in 1997 as governor he signed a law restricting the abolition of sodomites.
25113	123	During the 2000 campaign, the Republican President did not support a single act concerning the so-called law. The rights of gay. However, in the presidential debate he said he opposed the “marriage” of people of the same sex, but he supported the laws of the state in this matter. Governor Bush became the first Republican president candidate to ever meet publicly with the “Gay” Republicans in Austin, Texas. On August 4, 2000, he received the support of Log Cabin Republicans, the largest GOP group.
25113	125	On June 27, 2002, the 43th President of the United States signed a law allowing the payment of death benefits to firefighters and police officers who died at the service, for the first time expanding federal death benefits to couples of the same sex.
25113	127	He was President George H.W. in 2013. Bush was a witness to the “marriage” of people of the same sex: Bonnie Clement and Helen Thorgalsen.
25113	129	President Donald Trump was the first Republican candidate to openly praise sexual minorities and promised that he will “do everything in his power to protect LGBTQ citizens from violence and the oppression of hateful foreign ideology.” He did this way to the shooting at a nightclub in Orlando in 2016.
25113	131	Trump has appointed two homosexuals to the national justice system, although he has withdrawn some privileges from the time of Obama and advised the embassy not to lift “hand” flags. He also appointed several sodomites for exposed positions. Richard Grenell at the headquarters of the US Ambassador to Germany. He was subsequently appointed as Director of National Intelligence. Trump was the first Republican president to recognize the LGBT Duma Month in June 2019. He also announced that the aim of his administration is to dekriminalize homosexuality worldwide. For Trump, the FDA allowed homosexuals to donate blood, etc. But the 45th President declared the “transom” war.
25113	133	Nowadays, there is a struggle in the United States between “their good conservative gays” and libertarians seeking de facto sexualization of children. Ann Coulter, a former member of the GOProud Advisory Board and a long-term supporter of “LGBT conservation” says that “gays must be pro-life.” Therefore, some homosexuals in the Republican Party are opposed to abortion.
25113	135	More radical homosexual leaders complain on the Sodomites associated with the Republican Party that they have neglected and capitulated against the anti-Gay program formulated and implemented by the religious right. The faith itself in the limited role of the government and the low taxes cannot, in their opinion, justify the withdrawal from the radical minority programs.
25113	137	It appears that the Republican “gays” have supported the Don’t Say Gay Act, which the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, signed on March 28.
25113	139	The LGBTQ+ subcultures are concerned. Conservative homosexuals contribute to the dissemination of “lowly influenced homofobia” by proclaiming the struggle against grooming, which is a particular “cover” for homofobia, like QAnon for anti-Semitism. In the United States, the struggle between “radical” and “conservative” homosexuals is worsening, and as Leatherwood considers, there are “normal, healthy gay” and those who proclaim the “left program on child sexuality.”
25113	141	LGBT conservationism in Europe as an anti-Islam
25113	143	Specific changes have also occurred in the conservative parties of other countries in the world. In Europe for example. In the Netherlands or Belgium, the inclusion of gender ideology in the program of the party named Conservative is linked to the fight against Islam. Acceptance of homosexuality means belonging to a “liberal nation”. The combination of liberal values and “inclusion to the main north” of the gay identity Jasbir Paur called “homonationalism.” Everyone who does not accept sexual devices (on homosexuality it does not end) is not “modern, civilized Europeans.”
25113	145	In Sweden, the “justice” Swedish Democrats (SD) clearly say that children raised by same-sex couples should not be condemned, and the real threat is immigrants and Muslims, who do not accept “liberal values” such as tolerating homosexuality.
25113	147	The National Front in France has also changed its approach to gender ideology. In Germany, the evolution of the position of the “conservative party” occurred in the 1990s, when both the CDU/CSU and the leftist SPD (Social Democratic Party) headed towards the ideological center, which was linked to the relaxation of Merkel’s approach to customary issues. On the other hand, there was a space for more expressive groups both on the right and left side of the political scene.
25113	149	The Bundestag approved the Homosexuality on June 30, 2017 and although approximately 75% of the conservative members voted against it, the conservative members in the controversial electoral districts were likely to attract leftist voters, saying they were “for same-sex marriages.”
25113	151	Merkel’s party promoted the sodomites. Former German Foreign Minister for Merkel, Guido Westerwelle has contributed to the “warming” and greater acceptance of homosexuality among others. by continuously taking your partner to official foreign trips. The current Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, is also a gay.
25113	153	The active – within the so-called conservative parties – groups of “LGBT conservatives” contributed to a change in the interpretation of conservative values, among which the defence of morality was from the very beginning. Today, conservative parties have been dominated by liberals and libertarian.
25113	155	It is not surprising that the anti-Christian program was launched by them. In the nineteenth century, the Catholic counter-revolutionary Juan Donoso Cortes predicted that when God’s sovereignty is negated, when God’s vigilance and the existence of sin is negated, there will be a number of other errors that infect the social and political domain, institutions and law.
25113	157	The Spanish counter-revolutionist emphasized that the world is ruled by a “man of sin,” who is even “moral,” so much that “to the peak.” He has his broken dekalog, “dogmates”, “the Bible”, a catalogue of “cnotes” and “sins”, and even “inquisition.” It is increasingly courageous to demand their recognition and regret for their own understood lines. A specific reflection of this way of thinking is the phenomenon of “LGBT conservation.” There is no good outcome from that.
25116	1	Grzegorz Braun: Stop Ukraineization of Poland!
25116	3	We may not agree with Gregory Braun in some matters, but he is the only politician in the Knesset who draws attention to Polish governors’ absurd policy towards “fighters” from Ukraine.
25116	5	Poseal presented the draft document “Stop Poland’s ukrainisation”. It is the only program to stop the process of disintegration and decomposition, not only ethnic, but also political, and territorial, of the Polish state. “When it comes to help, let’s save lives, but not the standard of life,” Braun said, relocating the main assumptions of the document. There are two things to solve the problem.
25116	7	“First of all, we must firmly put on that, today uncontrolled process, from the first days uncontrolled by the Border Service, the passage of unknown closer and undefined in terms of status and purposes coming to Poland from Ukraine. The second thing is that we need dedicated solutions, not the inclusion of Ukrainian refugees into the Polish social care system. But some would desire that a quick step would be to bring Ukrainians into the Polish legal system as voters. We are strongly opposed to this, says Grzegorz Braun. According to the policy, the situation is developing very quickly. He pointed out that although some time ago his group was criticized for designating migrants from Ukraine as “presidents”, it is now used in the political world, including at the NATO summit in Madrid. Are the “Russian Owns” there?
25116	9	Help real refugees in accordance with international conventions is to save their lives and provide refugees. In Poland, the Catholic rule of Ordo Caritatis was completely reversed. The temporary in the theory of “immigrants” is treated as full-righteous citizens of the III RP, although no war actions are carried out on the vast majority of the territory of Ukraine. The ruling traitors have already announced the construction of “tain municipal houses” for the residents, although for years they were not for the indigenous population. The Poles cannot bear the greatest costs of imperial wars caused by the competing powers. People and their needs should always be in one place. It is not for this reason that we have dismissed the Moscow settlers to now govern Poland by the settlers of Washington, Brussels, Tel Aviv and Kiev.
25117	1	Abkhazia is opposed to Russia. They don’t want Vladimir Putin.
25117	3	In Abkhazia, a separatist pro-Russian republic formally part of Georgia, there was an outbreak of social dissatisfaction. All because President Aslan Bjanya has announced the transfer to Russia of the territory on which Vladimir Putin's villa is to be placed.
25117	5	The independence of Abkhazia was recognized by Moscow in 2008 after the so-called five-day war between Russia and Georgia. Formally, Abkhazia remains part of Georgia, but in fact it is a Russian protektorate, similarly to the so-called Cchinwalski region (South Ossetia).
25117	7	As for the post-Soviet area, Abkhazia is a fairly democratic quasiptatic formation. There are regular and free presidential and parliamentary elections. However, all political forces are less or more pro-Russian, which is due to geopolitical conditions. The Abkhazi view Russia as a guarantee of its independence. They do not want to live together with the Georgians in one state body. Unlike South Osetia, whose authorities seek to formally join the Russian Federation (a referendum has been promised several times, but it has not come to effect, because of the lack of interest of Moscow), Abkhazia wants to remain as an independent entity as possible.
25117	9	Paper Independence
25117	10	However, this independence is mainly on paper. The economy of this small parapaity is completely dependent on the northern neighborhood. Abkhazians mainly earn income from mandarin exports and numerous Russian tourists arriving. In addition, on the territory of Abkhazia, Russian troops are stationed at a base in Gudaute, and the border is guarded by the Russian border guards. The Russians also invest in the local infrastructure and tourism sector.
25117	12	Soviet resort
25117	13	Abkhazia even in the Soviet times great success in the political elite of the empire as a holiday resort. The Soviet gensekers came to her for rest. The most famous Abkhazi resorts could include Suchumi, Picunda, Gagry and New Aton.
25117	15	After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the declaration of independence by Georgia between Georgia and Abkhazia, there was a war that was won by Suchumi with the clear but informal support of Russia. The Republic has fallen down. The towns often turned into ruins.
25117	17	Abkhazi are well aware that they are dependent on the Russians. However, from time to time the local population is opposed to too pro-Russian predictions, as some politicians say.
25117	19	Rebellion of Abkhazia
25117	20	In recent days, Abkhazi protested against the de facto idea of President Aslan Bjani, who a few days earlier announced that he would transfer to Russia 184 hectares of forest and 115 hectares of water in the village of Picunda. These territories are located in the reserve area. There will be the residence of President Vladimir Putin.
25117	22	As a result of the Abkhazi protests, the parliament decided to postpone the decision to transfer the territory to the Russian side. President Bjanya explained that the granting to the Russians of the land is the result of the agreement concluded in 1995 He also emphasized that Vladimir Putin likes to visit the town, and Russia has much greater funds for investments in the resort.
25117	24	We will not give the earth
25117	25	The issue of land ownership in Abkhazia is an extremely annoying topic. For several times in the past, the Abkhazian society has opposed the ideas allowing foreigners to buy territories. They said that the very wealthy Russians would buy most of the attractive lands in Abkhazia. On the other hand, the Abkhazi authorities have claimed that they do not have sufficient funds to make the necessary investments in different sectors of the economy. But so far, no Abkhazian government has decided to adopt a law allowing the free purchase of land by the Russians.
25118	3	The value of new Chinese investments in Russia as part of the Strategic Trail and Trail Initiative (BRI) fell to zero in the first half of 2022; this is an unprecedented situation, indicating China’s refusal to bear the costs of the sanctions imposed on the Kremlin in response to the aggression against Ukraine, the Financial Times.
25118	5	In the first six months of this year, Beijing has not signed any agreements with Russian entities under the BRI. This is a complete novelty, not observed since the launch of the Chinese initiative nine years ago. In 2021, the value of Chinese-Russian contracts amounted to approximately $2 billion. The researchers from the Fudan University in Shanghai, quoted by FT, said.
25118	7	As highlighted in the report developed by this university, after the reduction of engagement in Russia, China expanded its investment scope in the Middle East. In the first half of the year, the Czech Republic signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia, worth approximately $5.5 billion. Last year, China invested $10.5 billion. Construction projects in Iraq.
25118	9	China’s position in the Middle East is strengthened after the United States formally ended its military mission in Iraq and withdrew from Afghanistan. U.S. President Joe Biden visited Riyadh in July. He promised there that he will “not leave and leave the vacuum that China, Russia or Iran will fill,” we read in the Financial Times.
25118	11	China is one of Russia’s closest allies on the international arena and opposes the Western sanctions imposed on the country in response to the Kremlin’s aggression against Ukraine. However, Beijing has not yet decided to provide direct economic and military support to Moscow.
25118	13	Multimodal (using rail and sea connections) China-Europe transport corridors have been expanded since 2013 within the framework of the Chinese Pass and Road Initiative, also known as One Pass and One Road. It is not only an economic initiative, but also a geopolitical project, directly supported by the Chinese authorities and serving to strengthen the influence of Beijing, among others. Central Asia and South Caucasus.
25118	15	The most important transportation route within the framework of this initiative has so far been the connection through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus and Poland, which used among others. Terminals in Malaszewice and Sławkowie. In 2015, regular rail transportation from China's Chengdu to Boat was launched.
25118	17	In mid-April, Chinese media that the new multimedia connection to Mannheim in Germany omits Russia. The first transportation of goods by alternative route was carried out on April 13. The route begins in Xi'an in central China, and then leads through Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Black Sea, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to Mannheim in the western part of the Russian Federation. The length of the connection is about 11.3 thousand. by km.
25119	1	Germany is angry in Poland. Too little, too late.
25119	3	The idea of compensating the eastern European countries for the Soviet production tanks delivered to Ukraine with modern German equipment failed and led to a sharp dispute with Poland.
25119	5	"The German newspaper ""Sueddeutsche Zeitung"" returns on Monday (25.07.2022) to the media discussed for several days the dispute between Germany and Poland on the exchange of military equipment. The Ringtausch. In exchange for the T-72 tanks produced by the Soviet Union, Poland and other Eastern European countries had to receive modern equipment from Germany."
25119	7	The proposal issued in late April was pleased with the support of both the German government and the opposition, giving hope for quick aid to Ukraine, Szymanski reminds. The Ukrainian armed forces have a weapon that they know well and do not have to waste time on training. The German government has promised to compensate the partners for the equipment.
25119	9	So much theory. The practice looks completely different in July: in addition to the declarations of intentions and numerous troubles, the system of equipment exchange brought little, and with Poland there was even a sharp dispute,” the author writes.
25119	11	German proposals: “for little, too late”
25119	13	Poland has delivered more than 200 Soviet-made tanks to Ukraine. The German side offered Poland 20 older models of tanks – Leopard 2A4. According to the Polish Defense Ministry, German tanks will be able to operate only in 12 months.
25119	15	“It’s too little, too late,” said the head of the defense department, Mariusz Błaszczak. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Poland needs 44 tanks. Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk even spoke of a “conscious misconduct” of the Polish side.
25119	17	There is also a disappointment in Slovenia. The Germans initially planned to strengthen the Slavic army by withdrawing from the Bundeswehr vehicles of the type Marder and Fuchs, but the Slovenians considered this equipment an outdated. Slovenia is demanding more modern Boxer combat wagons, Leopard 2 tanks and Puma carrier carriers. There is no progress in the negotiations, he emphasizes. The negotiations are also ongoing with the Greek authorities, but there are no results yet.
25119	19	“Why are conversations so difficult?” I am thinking of Simeon. According to him, the Bundeswehr needs modern equipment. At the end of the Cold War, Germany had over 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks. Currently, the Bundeswehr has only 225 machines. Only after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Berlin began the modernization of the equipment. Armed factories are now starting to gradually deliver new Leopard models.
25119	21	Would the Bundeswehr miss tanks?
25119	23	“Every tank that is now transferred to other countries may soon be missing by the Bundeswehr,” Szymanski explains. The construction of the tank takes several years. One of the reasons is the lack of parts, including luf to parts. Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht has promised that it will not allow the further weakening of the Bundeswehr.
25119	25	According to the author, the government’s coalition is supporting the equipment exchange. “It doesn’t work,” said Parliamentary Defence Commission chairman Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann (FDP). “I wonder if this method is appropriate, although in individual cases an agreement seems possible,” the FDP deputy added.
2512	1	Between the narrative and (de)information: the Serbian media news about Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
2512	4	The visible reactions of the Serbian authorities over the past few weeks to the escalation of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine show that decision makers in Belgrade are trying to maintain a neutral position to the events in eastern Europe. The conflict between the Russian and Ukrainian media in Serbia is similar. In turn, the information message presented by the Serbian tabloids remains clearly selective and more or less pro-Russian. The desirable interpretations and narrations of Russia about the current war make the contents presented in the mass media in Serbia at least partially different from what the media of the majority of European countries publish, openly indicating the unprovoked, aggressive and illegal nature of Russia’s actions against Ukraine.
2512	7	The Serbian authorities are withdrawn and neutral to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Serbia’s position on the Russian-Ukrainian war differs from the EU countries that openly condemned Russia’s actions and decided to impose multi-dimensional sanctions on the Russian Federation. The visible reactions of the Serbian authorities over the past few weeks to the escalation of the crisis and the final aggression of Russia against Ukraine show that the authorities in Belgrade are trying to maintain a neutral position against the events in the East and are trying to maintain good relations with both the attacked Ukraine and the obvious aggressor of Russia. This leads to the conclusion that the declared neutrality by Serbia is in practice two-significant, has pejorative coloring, and in some aspects means de facto symbolic and actual support of Russia (see Z. “Commentary No. 556”.
2512	10	Public media in Serbia: media centered. The Serbian policy of neutrality with respect to the events in the East is reflected in the content of the news message presented by public broadcasters. This translation can be considered descriptive, balanced, factorial, more or less symmetrical and in a specific way neutral, i.e. presenting the positions of both sides, but deprived of a deep discussion on the obvious, unlawful nature of Russian aggression and the war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
2512	13	This assessment is confirmed by the analysis of the media content for the period from 15 February to 6 March 2022, prepared by the Regulatory Authority. Electronic Media Regulatory Board (REM) It shows that the Russian-Ukrainian war is now the most important topic presented in RTS 1. According to REM, the content presented by public broadcasters (RTS 1, RTS 2, RTV 1 and RTV 2) during the analyzed period – including information about the war in the east – had a decisive majority of neutral character (an neutral was recognized from 66,02% to 81,42% of the total media transmission).
2512	16	Serbian tabloids: proud of Russia. Analysis of the content of the Serbian media from the last three weeks shows that popular private media (tabloids)[2], forming a news message reaching many inhabitants of Serbia, present content that can be considered far-selective, favouring Russian narratives or pro-Russian openings[3].
2512	19	"Relating to the events in Ukraine, the Serbian tabloids often presented, therefore, manipulated and false – and sometimes also obviously absurd – statements of the Russian side on: the armed conflict provoked by NATO; the defence nature of the actions of Russia, drawn into the war by the West; the geopolitical context of the events in the East; the legitimate support of Russia for the threatened Donbass; the popularity of the Ukrainian side of extreme right and extremist attitudes; the persecution of the Russians by the authorities in Kiev; the biological weapons in Ukraine; the “barzinian preservation” of the Ukrainian army, etc. It also cited Putin's statements questioning the nationality of Ukraine. Many of these kinds of articles were in fact a meritory and linguistic calc (""Neonazists"", ""Neofasists"", ""NATO threats"", ""Ukrainian war lifting regime"", ""special military operation"") spread information, offered by the Russian media. The military successes of the Russian armies were also praised – real or supposed – (“Russia occupied Ukraine in one day”; “Russia reached Kiev in one day!”; “Russia broke the front near Gorlovka, is this the key victory of Putin’s army?”). The journal “Informer” on 22 February 2022 put the title “Ukraine attacked Russia!” The whole one-sided picture was accompanied by properly selected pictures of President Putin, suggesting that he is a strong and reasonable leader, effectively opposing the confrontative policy of the West."
2512	22	Although the popular Serbian media relates the events in the East in an unobjective way, in fact, however – what Marija Vučić points to – they do it however in a balanced way and do not escalate beyond the measure of the pro-Russian narration, and this self-restriction doesn’t seem coincidental (“I think the tabloids are still kept on the chain. I know very well how the information message from the tabloids can look [...] when they have no self-control [...]. These texts are to a certain extent elaborated, but they are not in accordance with the journalistic standards”[5]. However, the Serbian tabloids clearly avoid publishing information about the failures and losses of the FR army and the war crimes committed by the Russians in Ukraine.
2512	25	Information policy per facta concludentia. A characteristic element of the Serbian media space remains also the incompatible – and in the opinion of Željko Bodrožicia de facto schizofrenic – information transmission[6]. On the one hand, in the Serbian media, it is evident that it is withdrawn and neutral in the establishment of the narration of the authorities in Belgrade, which mutatis mutandis reflects the pro-Western and European vector in the foreign policy of Serbia. This narration at least partially meets the expectations of the anti-war coalition of Western countries, expecting that in key international matters the EU candidate Serbia will present a position consistent with the position of the EU countries.
2512	28	On the other hand, pro-government tabloids, publishing in the opinion of critics an informational message that meets the current demand of the Serbian decision makers, present a narrative favorable to the Russian side, entering the perspective of a significant part of the Serbian society and the expectations of politicians in the Kremlin. This is because, as says Nemanja Rujević, the President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić is too experienced to make elementary mistakes in foreign policy, and “the enthusiasm for Russian military activities leaves the tabloids”[7].
2512	31	It also seems that the pro-Russian news media, which is “controlled” by the authorities in Belgrade and promoted by a part of the media, is in essence a media cover for the pragmatic and – all proportions guaranteed – pro-European policy of Serbia. These authorities are fully aware that the possible and irresponsible involvement of Serbia in the armed conflict caused by the increasingly irrational actions of President Putin would have tragic political and economic consequences for all the Balkans and would bring the Western Balkans back to the 1990s.
2512	34	The proposals. The analysis of the content of the Serbian media allows to conclude that due to the present in the information space of the pro-Russian narratives, the media transmission directed to the Serbian society is at least partially different from what can be seen in the press and television of most European countries[8].
2512	37	A characteristic element of the media in Serbia is the bilateral information policy, in which the President of Serbia, aware of the existing international realities, officially points to the need to maintain a neutral attitude towards the conflict in the East, and the pro-governmental Serbian tabloids speak on the side of the allied Russia.
2512	40	The specificity of the Serbian media is in fact well reflected by the statement of President Vučić himself, who on 23 February 2022 accused the media – surprisingly – of lack of objectivism, stating that regardless of the situation, 80% of the Serbian media will always be on the side of Russia, and 20% – on the assumption against. This statement was likely to relieve – uncomprehensible in international receipt – the pro-Russian tone of the message presented by a large portion of the Serbian media.
2512	43	In Serbia there are also media that relate the conflict in the East in a way similar to most European broadcasters (e.g. journal “Danas” and television N1), but the power of their influence is limited.
25120	1	British journalist shows four scenarios of Putin's demolition
25120	3	"The invasion of Ukraine showed the real face of Vladimir Putin and helped the West understand that we have been in a state of war with Russia for a long time, says John Sweeney, a British investigative journalist and writer, author of the book ""Killer in the Kremlin"" published on Thursday. Among the possible scenarios of the defeat of Putin indicates, among others. Unhappy with the actions of the President of Russia. It also quotes the stories of Emperor Nicholas II and Adolf Hitler."
25120	5	“The fastest and best way to ensure the security of the West is to withdraw Putin from power, and this can happen by allowing the Ukrainian troops to a decisive victory, such that the Russian troops will be dismissed from all of Ukraine and humiliated. And this will probably trigger a series of events, similar to those that met Santa Claus II,” he convinced.
25120	7	Four scenarios of Putin's defeat
25120	9	Sweeney pointed out several possible scenarios of Putin's defeat. The first is that it will be the oligarchs, who, as he said, are angry on Putin for the result of the sanctions they were destroyed or half destroyed.
25120	11	The second is that the generals will do so, those who have not yet died on the front, because they are also angry for the fact that they have received a task – which is faced with the charter of the Ukrainians and the increasingly better equipment in their possession – which is actually impossible to do.
25120	13	The third is that Putin, who, as he suspects, is obsessively careful for his health and often undergoes surgery, after which one of them does not wake up from anesthesia.
25120	15	Finally, the most likely according to Sweeney is that Putin, who for years ordered the tricks of others, will eventually get himself like Adolf Hitler.
25120	17	“I judge that if the Russian army is defeated, then its commanders and key persons in the resorts will turn against Putin. To do this, it is necessary to send heavy equipment in appropriate amounts. The United Kingdom says, but for example. Italy, Germany and France do not do as much as they could. In turn, the United States, as usual, goes into war late – let’s remember how it was in 1917 and 1941 – but as they are doing it, they are doing it well. The HIMARS systems make a difference because they have greater scope than the Russian systems,” he noted.
25120	19	Putin has a small army to conquer Ukraine
25120	21	Speaking of the impossible to carry out the mission to conquer Ukraine, Sweeney called on his own, long before the invasion, calculations indicating that there would be a need for this several times more armies than the Russian president had thrown on that country.
25120	23	Attack always requires more attacking forces than defense – this ratio is usually 3:1. If it was 3:1, it would mean that if Ukraine had 200 thousand. soldiers, but also 100 thousand. Police and armed officials of other services, Russia should have attacked by forces of 900,000. people. But considering the fighting preference of the Ukrainians who defend their homes, this ratio is actually 7:1. This means that there would be a need for 2.1 million people, not 200 thousand, whom Putin actually sent. My calculations were good, and Putin and the CIA – no,” Sweeney said.
25120	25	He added that the decision to give up the struggle for the Kiev, to leave the north of Ukraine and to concentrate on the south-east, in the face of failure, was militarily correct and testifies that Putin understood his mistake and – despite some isolation from the world in which he has been since the COVID-19 pandemic – remains a rational actor.
25120	27	"A British journalist quoted the opinion of Simeon Gluzman, an Ukrainian psychiatrist who in Soviet times was the first to publicly oppose the use of psychiatry to persecute dissidents that Putin is rather evil than mad (""bad, not mad""). ""This is a good news in a certain sense because it will not use nuclear weapons. He knows that if he used it, it would be the end of Russia,” Sweeney said."
25120	29	The construction of Russia after Putin will be very difficult.
25120	31	Speaking about the future of Russia, he emphasized that it cannot be seen only by the prism of Putin. “I do not agree that there is no other Russia than Putin. It is Russia of Natalia (Estemir), Borisa (German), Alexia (Nawalny). The problem in the fact that this other Russia is narrated, it is shot, it is jailed. What we can hope is that the pressure on Vladimir Putin will be so great that it will become oppressive and then a new Russia will be created. And the request to my Russian friends is that – don’t rush it,” Sweeney called. However, he acknowledged that the construction of this new Russia will be a very difficult challenge.
25120	33	"“The problem is that Putin has been in power for 22 years, and this has caused the erosion and defeat of all institutions in the country. Before he became a spy, he was a gangster. What do gangsters do? They make sure there are no new people other than those with whom they have grown up. Putin is extremely loyal, but also requires extraordinary loyalty. There are no institutions in Russia that could replace this gangster system,"" a British investigative journalist and writer said."
25122	3	The Russian invasion of Ukraine has divided the Russian entertainment sector. Some artists talked for the actions of the Kremlin, others more or less openly criticized. The Ukrainian media, however, first and foremost indicate the silence of the close president to the Zelensky satiric-kabaret industry.
25122	5	One of the most frequently commented topics in the Russian show-business has become in recent months the emigration of the famous Ala Pugachova. The great star of the Russian estrad today is critically attended to the ruling regime, but according to the media, her decision to leave the country was, however, primarily caused by concerns about the consequences of the anti-government statements of her husband, about the 27 younger comedian Maxim Galkin. The couple and two children, younger than ten years old twins, decided to flee to Israel.
25122	7	Galkin is not the only Russian satirist who openly opposed the war. In a letter, the content of which was published by the independent Russian portal Meduza, 260 Russian or present in Russia comedians called for Vladimir Putin to “stop armed activities on the territory of Ukraine and regulate discrepancies through negotiations.”
25122	9	The Zelensky Coast is silent
25122	11	However, the examples of Galkin and the signatories of the letter to Putin are still a minority in the satirical industry. The majority of the satirists avoid speaking about war. The support voices are not heard even from the environment associated with the former Soviet, and today popular in almost all countries of the former Soviet cabinet league “KWN” (the Russian abbreviation from “Club of Happy and Imaginary”), where the career began by the current President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky and where until 2014 numerous appearances, and even successes of the cabinet teams from Ukraine.
25122	13	In April, the collaborator of Alexei Nawalny Lubov Sobol in a video posted on YouTube criticized the comics from the most popular Russian entertainment TV channel TNT, most of which come, like Zelensky, from “KWN”.
25122	15	"The ""black sheep"" for the Ukrainians became especially the Kazakh, but appearing primarily in Russia comedian Nurlan Saburov, who collaborates with TNT. During the spring talks in the U.S., asked for a speech on the ongoing war in Ukraine, he refused to take a clear position. “I also have my fears. I have a family and children, you should understand it,” he said from the scene."
25122	17	The body, which passed the magic, became, however, an unhappy joke, which he allowed himself during one of the performances. When an activist dressed in a flammed red color symbolizing the blood of the Ukrainians came into the scene, Saburov, seeking to relieve the situation, asked, “Is it a menstruation?” The Ukrainian media then accused him not only of stupidity and ignorance, but above all of bitterness.
25122	19	"A clear criticism of the Putin regime is also unlikely to be sought in most satirical programs. In the smiling shortcomings of Russia in the program “Renaissance in Russia” (Ros. ""Once in Russia"" TNT production appears as true irony to the recent events (for example, a song about how Russia deals with the lack of Western products caused by sanctions), but never exceeding certain boundaries."
25122	21	Ukrainian comedian: Russian artists “founder” of the FSB
25122	23	Many Ukrainian artists deeply annoyed the silence of Russian satirists. With greater understanding, although still critical, to the behavior of colleagues in the profession, the Ukrainian comedian Igor Lastoczkin addressed.
25122	25	Woodymyr Zelensky’s good friends, like him, began his career in “KWN”. He has long performed in Russia – among other things in the above-mentioned program – so that the satiric-cabaret environment knows “from the shadow.”
25122	27	Lastochkin revealed in one of the internet programs that after 24 February he talked with former friends, Russian comedians from TNT, about the war. The majority of them disagree with Putin’s actions. “In the end, however, I couldn’t convince them (to take a public vote on this topic – red.“The comic acknowledges.
25122	29	The reason for the silence of Russian artists is the fear of the consequences of honesty, he believes. According to him, the Federal Security Service (FSB) treats the artists in a certain sense as “containers,” who in case of opposition will be immediately arrested and then imprisoned.
25122	31	“The only way to get out is to leave Russia. They could then speak normally and thus keep their face,” Lastoczkin said with clear regret.
25122	33	Why do the Russians not speak of war?
25122	35	The only space in which some of the avoiding speaking about the Russian invasion of the satirists allow themselves to criticize it is the social media. Most often, however, these are cautious and quite general declarations about “supporting peace.”
25122	37	“The most important are people. “I have friends in Ukraine with whom I have a lot to do. I don’t want them or their families or anyone to suffer. I’m behind peace,” wrote for example the Russian-Cash comedian of TNT Azamat Musagaliyev – probably that was among other things his intention of Lastochkin, speaking of the comedians who refused to express a decisive speech about Ukraine.
25122	39	“It’s hard to surprise the Russian artists that they don’t talk about the war in Ukraine. in today’s Russia, which becomes a totalitarian state,” says Dr. Hab. Agnieszka Legucka from the Polish Institute of International Affairs.
25122	41	The speakers of EURACTIV.pl note that social media still gives a certain sphere of freedom of speech to the critics of the regime. “Russian authorities are not yet 100% controlling everything, although they are trying to do so, among other things. “Instagram and Twitter are blocked,” he said.
25122	43	“Russian authorities have adopted the tactics of legal regulation. They amend the law in such a way as to use justice more effectively to prosecute specific persons,” he explains. As he says, it is, in a certain sense, a “return to the past”, to the Soviet times, where – if necessary – a paragraph will be found on every unacceptable person. However, yet the authorities do not have such tools that would allow them to persecute all the critical of the Kremlin, the expert believes.
25122	45	The committees thus realize that while in social media they can afford a certain freedom, but also within certain limits, it marks.
25122	47	Freedom of speech in Russia will be increasingly restricted.
25122	49	Agnieszka Legucka also points to a certain naivity of the thought of many Russian satirists, which may also be the cause of their refusal to talk about the ongoing in the neighboring country war.
25122	51	According to her, “these artists who understand the situation have already left Russia.” Those who are still speaking about Ukraine on social media, but avoid taking a voice on this ‘offline’ say that all this will stop, that this ‘special operation’ will end, and it will return to normal.”
25122	53	In Legacy’s opinion, this is “a little too optimistic” thinking. Freedom of speech in Russia will be increasingly restricted. Putin is increasingly afraid of the loss of power and as the formula of the “external enemy” will be exhausted, we will have to look for the “internal enemy” – a “external enemy” – which already today is considered as “foreign agents” (Ros. “Inoagents” – red.“It explains.
25122	55	“In the end, intellectuals, including comedians, will become such enemies,” PISM analysts expect.
25123	2	Ukraine's military situation after nine weeks of war
25123	4	The second stage of the offensive on Ukraine began on April 19th. Russia has failed to break the Ukrainian defense in the east of the country. There are intense struggles there, but a significant change in the military situation should not be expected in the near future. At the same time, the importance of providing Ukraine not only with defence weapons, but also with other weapons systems is increasing: tanks, artillery and fighter wheels, which can allow it to maintain defence rubes and possible counterattacks. At the Rammstein conference on 26 April, the Western countries agreed to increase and coordinate such support.
25123	6	Where are the most intense armed operations?
25123	8	The Russians are conducting an offensive towards the towns of Siewierodonieck and Popasna in the Lugansk district and Slovyansk, Kurachowe, Awdijevka and Lyman in the Donetsk district. The operations are ongoing in the Kharkov district towards the city of Izium, the Kharkov is shot. Russia has also intensified the strikes in the Odesh and Chershen districts. On the east of Ukraine, the 1st units are fighting. The Army and 20. Army of the Western Army and 35. General Army and 68. Army of the Eastern OW.
25123	10	Russia has intensified its offensive actions in recent days, but they are still not enough to lead to overtaking control over the Lugansk and Donetsk districts in a short time. Although on April 21 Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu declared that Mariupol is under full Russian control, the city continues to be fighting – mainly on the territory of the Azovstal facilities. In Mariupol, the Russians use conventional bombs that increase losses among civilians. Furthermore, Russia has changed its current tactics and started on the territory of Ukraine warning rail infrastructure and other critical infrastructure facilities, including military, wanting among others. to block the supply of weapons to the fighting Ukrainian units.
25123	12	What is the situation of the defenders and what is the military support of the Western states?
25123	14	The headquarters of Ukraine said the forces operating in Donbass are stopping several significant attacks by Russia every day. In the east and south of Ukraine there are dozens of brigades operating – mainly mechanized, tank and motorized infantry. The Ukrainians support their defence. on land roofs (natural geographical obstacles), which increases its effectiveness. A very important role is also played by the intelligence information transmitted to Ukraine by NATO countries.
25123	16	The Ukrainian side does not provide any reports of its own losses, however, taking into account the Russian data, it can be assumed that it will be forced to supplement the personal states of combating units and significantly exhausted the potential possessed before the war equipment. This increases the importance of rapid supply of weapons from Western countries, training soldiers and healing injured. On April 26th, 40 countries debated at a conference at the U.S. Rammstein base in Germany on the possibilities of aid to Ukraine. After the conference many assurances fell – mainly from the NATO countries, but also, for example. Australia, on the transfer of advanced weapons systems to Ukraine. Germany announced the delivery of its own aircraft departments to Gepard, and the UK, among others. Starstreak aircraft. It has already arrived in Ukraine. U.S. Households Cal. 155 mm and T-72 tanks. In addition, NATO states are training Ukrainian operators for the supplied weapons systems.
25123	18	What actions will Russia take?
25123	20	In the coming days, we can expect an intensification of the fighting activities conducted by Russia mainly in eastern Ukraine. An important goal will be the actual overtaking of control over Mariupol, which means an increase in the number of land shootings of the Azovstal plants. Only after the occupation of the whole city will Russia be able to break a part of the units to fight in the Lugansk, Donetsk and Zaporsk districts. For the Russians, it will also be important to strengthen their positions in the Mikhailovsky, foreseeable and cruise directions. They will continue to strengthen their troops operating in the south-east and east of Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff indicates that to the border with Ukraine of the Belgorod district, the Russians moved two battalion tactical groups from the 76th desant-storm division. Given the increased activity of the Black Sea Fleet, further attacks on cities on the Black Sea coast can also be expected, but also on the critical infrastructure located in the west of Ukraine. The activity of the Russian aviation will also increase.
25123	22	What can we expect in the coming days?
25123	24	Given the importance of the date 9 May, when the Day of Victory is celebrated in Russia, it should be expected to intensify the Russian propaganda activities aimed at its own society, showing the legitimacy of the struggles conducted in Ukraine and indicating the “military plans” supported by NATO states of the Ukrainian side. It is not possible to exclude the activities of Russian services on the territory of Russia, e.g. fire or bombing of explosive goods, regardless of the actions carried out by the Ukrainian side in the Russian regions bordering with Ukraine. They will be accused of the Ukrainian dissent, which will increase the feeling of hatred to the Ukrainians.
25123	26	Further provocations, similar to the launch of two radio towers on April 26th, may also occur in Naddniestr. Considering that without additional support for its armed forces that are stationed in the region, Russia will not be able to carry out offenses on Ukraine from there, these provocations will be aimed at influencing the so-called. The separatist authorities of Naddniestr. Russia is concerned to give up the previous declarations of neutrality to the war in Ukraine, it also wants to create a psychological effect, showing Ukraine as an aggressive state, conducting action divergently not only in Russia.
25124	1	Putin is looking for two
25124	3	The flavor of the bottle on the bottom.
25124	5	If somewhere you can celebrate the holiday of the glass, it is of course in Russia. However, it’s not about the content of the dish, but a concrete model, which inspires the citizens of the Russian Federation with pride. These are the popular border glasses of the type of cup available in the IKEA stores. Many of you have such things at home. The Russians may have a problem with this because IKEA has withdrawn from their country. You can buy it, but not in the Ikea store. At least they know how to do it, and that’s something. This may not be a technique for the iPhone or other goods from the sudden West, but it meets the more basic needs of the average Russians than it meets with the tick-to-tick disconnections.
25124	7	There is no better time to tell about this glass than now, after the victory against Sweden and during the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
25124	9	Four Canadian
25124	11	The glasses are popular because they are cheap and practical. A large part of them is produced in the Russian factories, and the troopers of curiosity and the influence of Russian alcohol-technical thought on the history of the world claim that it was invented in Russia. The birthday is celebrated on September 11, but (or because it is not known to them recently) it has nothing to do with the terrorist attack. There is no doubt that a few Russian men after wrapping a few glasses will sometimes attack their spouse.
25124	13	The “Graniony stakan”, or “graniasta skanka”, had to appear in the world in the 17th century, during the time of Emperor Peter I. He wanted the fleet officers to drink wine in the west, from a glass, and not from wooden dishes like a dick. This glass was not then as common and cheap material as today, therefore it was necessary to submit how to avoid losses. One that is expensive, and two that is dried glass is the risk of scaling. The same problem, but the push to the Western civilization was stronger.
25124	15	The specific shape of the glass was to make it easier to drink on board the ship, because falling, it didn’t rotate on the tables and the floor as its round counterparts. It was also better to lie in the hands when the waves were laid, and the company didn’t necessarily maintain full psychomotor performance. The historic anecdote of the first producer of the glass is given to the Vladimír glassmaker Efrem Smolin, who was intended to present the rulers this immaculate alternative. Peter I had to look at the invention to throw the “stakanu byt”, thus signaling his approval. The circle of the emperor, however, heard a “bite” and broke the glasses for happiness. So here the prototype of the untouchable glass started his career broken into a small mak. 
25124	17	We broke
25124	19	The true and documented career of the border glass began in the times of the Soviet Socialist Union. There is no lack of legend and imagination. The author of the project of the glass in the form known to this day was to be according to the general opinion of Vera Muchin – a sculptor with many socialist works on account. Among the most recognizable are the “Robotnik i kolchoźnica” – a monumental sculpture depicting a pair of Soviet people with a mould and a mould in their hands – the symbol of the film studio Mosfilm. The artist who designed the glass was inspired by the ancient Greek columns, in addition to the spirit of practicality. The creation process was also attended by the painter Kazimierz Malewicz, the author of the famous “Black Quadrate on a White Background”.
25124	21	Very little is known about the real creators of the project. Getting big names adds a glass of splendor, but it probably has a pretty smooth connection to reality. Although nothing can be excluded: many artists chalture to have to do with the garna to put, and when the homeland calls and pays... especially when it is the Soviet homeland. Muchina designed a cup of beer, so why should she refuse to participate in the work on a glass of water? It is better to design a glass than to slide a Siberian glass.

25125	3	Horses, horses, horses, white-red-granate has garnitures.
25125	5	After the outbreak of the war, the awakened Polish society decided to punish the proklemlovsky merchandise and to carry out a consumer boycott. Based on the monitoring of card payments in the stores of those brands and companies that remained in Russia, the PKO BP bank found that sales in them fell. The consumer boycott, if applied massively, can actually work. This shows the withdrawal of another scared vision of losing too much of the revenue of big from Russia. At least for a moment or partially, as did Nestle – a group offering up to 2,000. A variety of products that can be boicoted, including the legendary Viniary mayonnaise.
25125	7	Global Village
25125	9	In the era of globalization, it might seem that truly ethical and beyond any suspicion is just what you cultivate yourself. But this statement, if we go deep into it, may be false. Nowadays, the consumer is immersed in a broken network of market connections. As a rule, it is not able to verify the source of the product on its own, so it must rely on the labels or words of the seller. The more conscious buyers buy from local producers, for example. on the rings. They prefer to pay more, but not to put their hands on unethical practices, environmental destruction, climate warming or – what is now on time – war crimes.
25125	11	The evil does not sleep. While everyone focused on the boycott of Auchan and Nestle, the fifth column of Putin took a more makiavelic form – a corn. 
25125	13	Russian field
25125	15	According to the greenhouse owners, the process has been on a long time and not even a war is scary to him. The Russian corns are brought by thirds to the Polish large companies, which pack them, attach the label and go on as their own, and most importantly for the consumer – our own. Folded Russian corns are sold to large markets, but also to small vegetables and retailers. They are imported so much that there is no room for local vegetables. The situation is so serious that the purchase of Polish garlic in Poland is practically impossible. Because all the fun is illegal.
25125	17	Putin's corners go to us on a circular road, mainly from Macedonia, with false papers.
25125	19	They had previously arrived from Lithuania and Latvia, but, as it turned out, these countries are more civilized than the IV RP – after learning about the matter, they began to carry out controls and the procedure was shortened.
25125	21	As angry farmers say, who, because of the fear of the corn mafia, prefer to remain anonymous, a certain Silesian company, which itself produces a little corn, will supply half of the country. Ukrainians are employed to pack vegetables, they are exported by Polish suppliers, and they are stored in refrigerators built for EU funds for the development of Polish agriculture. The expense on Russian corns is so large that on one transport you can earn from 80 to 100 thousand. The bad. Interestingly, Agrounia the situation of the agricultural resort, which probably stated that if it finds that the problem does not exist, it will magically disappear. I can’t even say that because of the imagery the government deliberately shuts the eye to the illegal, extremely immoral and enduring Polish farmers’ grape process, only to keep the prices lower.
25126	1	The heart, the heart, the mind
25126	3	In order for Ukraine to win, Putin must get a slay. The Poles are doing everything they can to make them laugh.
25126	5	“I am built that the initiative, which came out of Sandomier, found a positive reception in cities like Warsaw, Krakow, Rzeszov, Białystok and Plock. I believe that the hymn of Ukraine will rise instead of the heinals in other Polish cities,” the mayor of Sandomierza, Marcin Marzec, called for the citizens of the free world.
25126	7	In order for Putin to go to the fifth place and “in the framework of solidarity with Ukraine”, the Ukrainian flag was suspended on the Jarosławski ratus.
25126	9	“I urge libraries to join the ‘Heart for Ukraine’ campaign. Just lift your heart in a visible place (window, door, regails, at the boat, in the reading rooms) and post photos of blue-yellow hearts on Facebook with the hashtag #SolidarnizUkraina. Let’s create together a gallery of photos of “Serc for Ukraine” – she gave a camouflage to the victory over the aggressor of the library in the Middle East.
25126	11	The Warsaw Beer Festival also gave resistance to the Russian soldier. “In this difficult time, we need the help of the Ukrainians. I miss words, but not hope. The community associated with artistic beer rapidly responded to the current situation, creating special beer,” the organizers said.
25126	13	Since the whole Polish people are fighting against the Russian imperialism, there could not be a lack of tattooists in this struggle. The Wroclaw Chimera Tattoo all the money earned on the drawing of each Ukrainian flag was spent to help Ukraine. Jack Galan Art Studio from Szczecin – the same: the income for tattoos with the symbol of the yellow-blue heart was allocated to the collection. The minimum cost of a tattoo is $100. The humility of the tattooists did not allow them to tell how many Ukrainian hills were performed over a few days of action.
25126	15	The struggle with Putin is on the internet. “The illegal and unprovoked military actions of Russia in Ukraine” force internet users to boycott Russian products. To do this, social networks call to read the numbers on the chart code. If the first 3 numbers are 460-469, it means that the item has been produced in the Russian Federation and it is not allowed to be purchased. Unless the Russian company operates in the territory of another country. It will have a different pack, but it is not allowed to be purchased. Bensin from Orlen, produced from Russian oil, is of course a Polish product.
25126	17	More advanced internet users have jumped on the seat of an anti-Russian hacking cyber terrorism. Attacks, data leaks and the security breakdown itself, however, have made a crack not to Russian companies, but to the intelligence of different countries that have long been spying these databases. That’s why the goodwill hackers have appealed not to get stuck, because the entire long-term CIA and Mossad intelligence robot is going to be frightened by the invasion. Therefore, these appeals appeared on the pages for the Polish network hackers: “With grabbing in critical systems, you can hinder someone who already lives there and can a much greater effect than you have planned. Ukraine is undoubtedly receiving valuable intelligence information from NATO countries, and a lot of them probably comes from the cyber world. Don’t describe it.”
25126	19	Other Polish interlocutors who are not hackers thought they would do a bad thing to Putin by slowing down the Russian networks. They released, but not those officially censored by the Kremlin, but those that were used by Russian internet users who wanted to know more than that the Russian army is deeply striking the killing of its own civilians of the Nazis from Ukraine.
25129	1	Tensions on the Kosovo-Serbia border. Protest of Serbs. Two borders are closed.
25129	3	On Sunday, 31 July, the Kosovo authorities closed two border crossings with Serbia. The decision came after the northern Kosovo ethnic Serbs blocked the roads and shot the police. They protested against the order to exchange the Serbian car registration tables to Kosovo.
25129	5	Kosovo declared its independence 14 years ago. Nearly 50,000 Serbs living in northern Kosovo are still using the registration tables and documents issued by the Serbian authorities. They do not want to recognize the state documents in this way.
25129	7	in Kosovo. Government Closes Border Crossing with Serbia
25129	9	The Kosovo authorities have previously announced that from 1 August, the Serbs will have two months to exchange tables and documents. They also decided that from that day all the citizens of Serbia will have to obtain an additional document on the border that will allow them to enter Kosovo. The same principle is applied by the authorities in Belgrade to visiting Serbia citizens of Kosovo.
25129	11	"Protesters on Sunday, 31 July, blocked the roads that led to two border crossing and lifted baricades with trucks filled with rubber and other heavy equipment. The Kosovo police said they were shot ""in the direction of police units, but fortunately no one was injured."""
25129	13	Due to the protests on the border, the authorities decided to close both border crossing – Jarinje and Bernjak.
25129	15	Kosovo and Serbia. After the protests, the authorities delay the plan of exchanging car records
25129	16	In the night of July 31 to August 1, the authorities made the decision. The government in Pristina has postponed for a month the implementation of the plan that imposes on ethnic Serbs residing in northern Kosovo the exchange of car records from Serbs to Kosovo within 60 days. The new date is September 1.
25129	18	"At the same time, the government of Prime Minister Albino Kurtiho condemned the road blocks in the north of the country and ""the police shooting by armed persons."" The responsibility for “aggressive actions” was taken by the Serbian authorities."
25129	20	Serbia lost control over Kosovo after the NATO campaign in 1999. The state has refused to recognize the independence of its former province and since 2008, that is, since it has declared its independence. It also does not agree to use in its territory tables with Kosovo registration.
25129	22	The tensions between the two countries are the highest in the past few years. Serbia and Kosovo began a dialogue under the auspices of the European Union in 2013, but a significant agreement has not yet been reached.
2513	1	What happens if the Poles don’t get vaccinated? Dr. Afelt: We do harm ourselves on our own desire
2513	3	The COVID-19 pandemic continues. Scientists are advising to prepare for the next variants of the coronavirus. They also remind that vaccines are still the best weapon. Poland is one of the weakly vaccinated countries in the EU. Moreover, the desire for vaccination has fallen rapidly in us. I am not afraid of the epidemic. What can this end? “We’re doing harm to ourselves,” says Dr. Aneta Afelt. This is not just about health reasons.
2513	5	“The crisis does not end until it ends everywhere.”
2513	7	The world is in the third year of the fight against the coronavirus. And experts warn: let’s not expect Omikron to be the last option we have to deal with. “The crisis does not end until it ends everywhere,” The Economic Times said. Experts still remind that vaccines are the best weapon against SARS-CoV-2 we have.
2513	9	When we analyze the data about our society’s vaccine, we can say that we simply do not use this weapon. This was by Prof. Karolina Sieroń, head of the Covid Division of the MSWiA Hospital in Katowice. “(...) In the case of COVID-19, we have the free benefit of the vaccines, and only 57% of the vaccines have benefited. The Society. The vaccines are not an experiment, they will not kill us, there are no chips in them; they are so that we can live further,” she said.
2513	11	Less than 58 percent. The vaccinated population is still not enough. This result is also one of the weakest in the EU/European Economic Area (map above).
2513	13	Moreover, the daily number of vaccinations is decreasing, and among non-vaccinated, the percentage of people who do not intend to take immunization is increasing. According to the latest research agency Inquiry, up to 47 percent. The respondents said they would not be vaccinated. At the beginning of January it was 45%. More about this in the article: The desire to vaccinate is drastically decreasing. People are not afraid of the coronavirus.
2513	15	Are we really ready to risk the lives and health of our children?
2513	17	In the public space, the topic of vaccination seems to have gone to a slightly further plan. That more than protection against the coronavirus, we are interested in the question of lighting the shrimp. However – let’s repeat – taking a vaccine (bestly three doses) is still the most important thing we should take care of during a pandemic.
2513	19	Of course, among the Poles there are still people who cannot get vaccinated, even because of a reduced immunity (e.g. persons after transplantation) or with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy. Among us there are children who are too small to be able to benefit from the protection that the vaccine gives, says Dr. Aneta Afelt from the Ds Team. COVID-19 at the headquarters. Let us pay attention to what is happening now: we have a wave of infections among children and younger and the wave of PIMS, which is the echo of the autumn wave of infections as a Delta variant. Are we really ready to risk the lives and health of our children and refuse vaccination? A rhetoric expert.
2513	21	"Dr. Afelt indicates a certain correctness visible in any epidemic – including SARS-CoV-2. The new pathogen that enters the game relates to ""success"" in the colonization of humans either in a specific age group, or a group with a specific health condition. As a rule, children have a fairly effective immune system, so they are somehow the last ""client"". In 2021, there will be a growing number of diseases among the youngest. This means that the coronavirus has ""judged"" for the last element, he emphasizes."
2513	23	What happens if the Poles are not vaccinated against COVID-19?
2513	25	At this question, Dr. Aneta Afelt replies: The effects of this are already visible even in the decision to cut the quarantine. The number of people in the quarantine has already reached such a level that they have begun to lack hands to work.
2513	27	"If so many Poles will continue to be unvaccinated, if we will continue to allow the population to become infected naturally (which also happens because of the non-compliance with the sanitary regime), then we will simply have to deal with the next waves of infections and the next variants that colonize us freely. Looking from a scientific point of view and taking into account the calculation of probability, I don't think that Omikron is the last variant that is able to ""make"" in the epidemic reality - the expert assesses. “And here comes the question: are we, as a society, able to accept that every six months we will be excluded from the labour market for a few, even a few weeks, because we have been infected with the virus and as untransplanted the disease we are getting worse? If so, how do we think about the competitiveness of our economy?"
2513	29	"Dr. Afelt points out that this type of epidemic ""sicknesses"" shorten the life of the population, but also the quality of that life. Long covid complications will have their health consequences. Moreover, they are already beginning to be visible, among other things. As a society, we live less. In Poland, deaths that are clearly associated with the ongoing epidemic (whether the direct cause is SARS-CoV-2 or lack of access to medical assistance) begin at the age of 35. Statistically, our population aged 15+ has at least one chronic disease, starting from the age of 35."
2513	31	From the public health point of view, we are a society sick and sensitive to situations like the current epidemic. To be honest, we do ourselves harm, and more, it happens on our own desire, says Dr. Afelt.

25132	1	The coronavirus. In Wuhan again lockdown for millions of citizens. Four cases of infection
25132	3	China continues to reject the party’s “zero COVID” policy. Nearly a million inhabitants of the outskirts of Wuhan city again covered were locked. All about four people who were infected with coronavirus.
25132	5	Wuhan, from which, according to the researchers, the coronavirus pandemic began, was again covered by a partial lockdown. All about the detection of cases of non-symptomatic coronavirus infection in four inhabitants of Jiangxi district, BBC reports.
25132	7	of China. Wuhan again covered with lockdowns. Four cases of coronavirus infection
25132	8	Two days ago in Wuhan, a city of 12 million citizens, regular tests showed two non-symptomatic cases of coronavirus infection in residents of Jiangxia district. Therefore, citizens of the district were ordered to stay in their homes or apartments for three more days. During the checking of the contacts of the infected persons, the authorities found two more cases of non-symptomatic infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
25132	10	Wuhan became known worldwide at the breakthrough of 2019 and 2020 as the first place where scientists discovered a new coronavirus, as well as the first city that was subjected to severe restrictions related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
25132	12	China, satisfied with the effects of these lockdown, still applies the “zero COVID” strategy, which includes mass tests, as well as strict rules of isolation and lockdown. Through this, this highly populated country manages to maintain the pandemic in the reefs, and infections and deaths are relatively few. However, this strategy affects both the citizens themselves and the economy of China, which is burdened by high frequency and prolonged blockades.
25133	1	Joe Biden defeated the coronavirus. U.S. President Ends Strict Isolation and Returns to Work
25133	3	The White House that the 79-year-old U.S. President Joe Biden did not and almost no symptoms of COVID-19 and today is returning to normal work.

25133	7	The symptoms of the disease almost completely disappeared. “The antigen tests carried out yesterday evening and this morning gave negative results,” O’Connor wrote, adding that the U.S. President will end full isolation today, although for 10 days in the surroundings of other people he will be preventively wearing a mask.
25133	9	The presidential doctor explained this decision by the fact that after treatment with PAXLOVIDEM in some patients, the virus may be re-detected. The White House has announced that the President of the United States will be regularly tested on COVID-19.
25133	10	Joe Biden is returning to normal work and still today he will speak a short speech to the Americans.
25134	1	There is energy, there are pinguins.
25134	3	The German city of Lübbenau is located about 90 kilometers south of Berlin and 75 kilometers from the border with Poland. His latest history is not at least an example of success and the city rather seems to accept the fact that the best years are already over. However, he does it in an interesting and impressive way, among other things with the help of the pinguins.
25134	5	The population is about 16,000. residents and geographically belongs to the Spreewald region. This name refers to the Spreva river which, along with its wide channels, flows near this town. Once, in the Enerdovs, the energy industry and large residential settlements in the center near the station made that in 1981 the population reached 22 thousand. After the collapse of the socialist state and the closure of the majority of factories, the number of inhabitants decreased systematically and in 2021 it was only 15,200 people.
25134	7	The world’s largest coal power plant
25134	9	Lübbenau has a great history of coal energy; in 1959 the largest coal power plant in the world was built here. It had a power of 1.3 GW and employed 5,000 people. In the 1990s, after a systemic breakthrough, it was decided to close the power plant, which under capitalist conditions was already considered unpaid.
25134	11	Currently, the energy supply in Lübbenau is responsible for the Stadt- und Überlandwerke GmbH Luckau-Lübbenau (Süll), whose main shareholders are the city of Lübbenau and the nearby municipalities. Energy is generated mainly in gas blocks. The Lübbenau heating plant is currently installed with two top boilers (each with a thermal power of 20.5 MW) and two cogeneration modules (1,2 and 0.8 MWel). The plant is powered by group H natural gas from its own high-pressure network.
25134	13	Süll has a medium voltage transmission network through which electricity is distributed and its own city heat transmission network.
25134	15	On the ground between the railway station and located north of it the residential settlement is now located tzn. The “energy field” was formed by the cooperation of the city of Lübbenau, Switzerland’s Repower and Süll. This is the place available to everyone on which you can see the innovative wind turbines “Windpillar”. With winds above 10 meters per second, the turbine is able to produce 17 250 kWh per year. The German branch of Repower has since 2010 operated the nearby wind park Kittlitz, which was built on the ground of the former exploration mining with the same name.
25134	17	Swimming Pool with Pinguins
25134	19	Lübbenau attracts tourists with an unusual offer. It is a great pool with 31 pinguins. Guests can observe birds through thick shells or take part in educational courses that end with the slashing and feeding of the pinguins. Even before the pandemic explosion, more than 5 million guests visited the pingvin pool.
25134	21	Initially, in 2007, Spreewaldwelten GmbH acquired two urban swimming pools, from which, after many repairs, the present water resort was formed. “Spreewaldwelten GmbH belongs to the city of Lübbennau and the local housing company,” says Sabine, who is leading educational lessons with the pinguins. The housing company, which belongs to more than 4100 apartments in Lübbenau and Altdöbern, in an interview with Businessalert WIS confirmed the fact that it is a shareholder of Spreewalswelten Gmbh.
25134	23	In the 2019 balance sheet report, Spreewaldwelten was listed as the profitable company of this company, which due to the high number of guests and the completion of the hotel building, which belongs to the pool complex, positively surprised the mother company, generating profits. The profitability of the pool and related restaurants and hotels confirmed in a conversation with BusinessAlert.pl also the person conducting educational activities. The Spreewaldwelten company is still profitable and is funded by its own funds, although water heating in the pool is unreasonably energy-consuming. In the case of pinguins, there are also costs of cooling food for these animals – frozen fish is stored in a large refrigerator.
25134	25	At the editorial question concerning the high energy costs, neither Spreewaldwelten GmbH, neither WiS housing co-operation nor the local energy supplier Süll gave no answer.
25134	27	In Germany, many swimming pools decided, facing high gas prices and the possible lack of this raw material, to lower the water temperature. For example, in Stuttgart, the water temperature is up to 26 degrees, not 28, and in Detmold, it is up to 24 degrees. The other is in Munich, where the swimming pools put on geothermia. There you can still swim in the heat.25135
25135	3	It’s not bad in Poland, it’s amazingly bad. The puppy crossed the measure of the bird to another success. You should not deepen the topic, as the executor did not deepen the channel, so instead of ships there will be kayak swimming.
25135	5	"Political and strategic investment, according to the writers, even military, has turned into tourism. It’s easier to visit the area with a boat than a submarine. The barks had a channel to transport Bolshevik coal. Now you will be able to transport the air in well-pumped mattresses. Stanisław Tym, a cowboy from the ""Rejs"", fled by a vessel around the Ves. On its celebrated 85th birthday, it can go a lot further, through the Fairy Eagle in a new, not less absurd journey. As long as the Russians don’t get to sleep with the sappers, they’re swallowing behind the Bayraktar of Sierakovsky. As long as the writer's success will drain the land by the homeland, connecting the channel with the CPK. And it will not be a network of channelled meliorative roves, with a transition in Włoszczov, because Poland is unfortunately not meliorated, only by PiS zaorana. The work will hide Kaczynski by country. The president praises the channel and tells about the enemy torpedoing the CPK. He promises the rise of the airport in Baranova, as if he raised a claim against Poland's deceiving traitors. It would be easier for him in Modlin, the fortress is already there, the ground prepared for the expansion of the airport, no one protests, and the municipality is waiting for the investment. The problem that could be promised by the Baranov to the Chinese and our line to which they will sign the Trans-Siberian. Poland is perfectly suitable not for the central European communication port, but for the central shipping warehouse of Chinese badge. Per this is its historical fate under the government of the devils.25136"

25136	7	New technologies, old problems
25136	9	The famous Japanese car manufacturer has stopped the sale of one of the supernova models of electric cars – we read on the portal “Money.pl”. Those who have already bought it recommend not using the car. Factory cars failures are, of course, no sensation, but we were interested in the reason to withdraw cars from the sale. There are no faults in chips or errors in the software. The accident was caused by problems with the wheels fixing the wheels – they may fall off while driving. We don’t know how the problem will be solved, but we’re sure that the engineers responsible for the design will have a strongly drawn slope.

25136	14	The giant aircraft is not flying.
25136	16	World media and social media are broadly commenting on the film, showing the vision of the giant aircraft – the hotel of the future. The film was published by the Yemeni popularizer of science. The aircraft could take 5,000 guests on board, which would take advantage of swimming pools, supermarkets, cinemas and theatres. Powered by 20 air engines, the hotel would not have to land for a few years, because the vision assumes that it would be powered by nuclear energy. We have doubts about the possibility of realizing this vision. All this news reminds us a bit of the text from the old satirical radio audition Trójka: “News from the country: A group of engineers built a single-wheeled car. The car does not drive.”

25136	21	Ethics for Baker
25136	23	This can be a strong candidate for the title of the “Invasion of the Year”. One of the “Great Four” advisory companies will pay in the U.S. a $100 million fine. Why? It was revealed that the company’s employees – including the candidates for auditors – took the exams (and more specifically – shared each other’s keys to answer). Half the poor that they pulled. Worse, that unfair practices took place during the exam of... professional ethics. This is a good idea for independent auditors. Although, on the other hand, in the times of career pursuit, nothing will surprise us. Unless it will be a draw on the practical exam on a driving license.

25136	28	10 Years and Curiosity
25136	30	There is no end to the years of Warsaw Investment Group. The process, which concerns the loss of 250 million PLN (invested by 1,2 thousand people), lasted more than 10 years. It ended with the kidnapping of the leaders of the WGI in 2020. Now it will start again because the Court of Appeal has repealed the judgment, the media reports. Although the case is not fun for either the accused or the injured, it’s hard not to get the impression that the work of justice in this case resembles Monty Python’s kick with the Olympic finale of fun in the hidden. After the two players reached the same time – over 11 years – in search of the rival, the judges recognized that there was a remission and managed the drive.

25136	35	The Punishment of Influencers
25136	37	UOKiK imposed penalties (from a few to tens of thousands of dollars) on several well-known influencers for “the lack of cooperation with the office”. Let’s explain that this is the process conducted by UOKiK regarding m.in. the proper indication by them of advertising content in the materials placed on the Internet. As UOKiK reports, the punished persons did not want to provide information or provide the required documents. More interesting than the UOKiK decision itself is the response of the internet users. Let’s say that it is far from compassion. The comments clearly show that the influencer in the eyes of the Internet users is someone that no one likes, but everyone would like to be.

25136	42	Cannabis inflation
25136	44	The Polish man must now work more than an hour to eat in McDonald’s Big Maca, Money.pl reports on MoneyTransfers.com. Ten years ago, in Warsaw, the price of Big Maca was equivalent to 36 minutes of work. As a result, Poland is among the 11 countries where the sofa is the most expensive. How do we deal with that road? As we know, an excellent advice on the amount of meat consumed by less wealthy Poles is served by the owner of Comarchu.

25136	53	Venice has a lot of one-day tourists cheating the streets of the historic city and – worse – unable to earn the hotelers. It intends to introduce a fee for this category of visitors. The best way would be to first get to change the titles with the authors of the guides, most of which are “Venice in one day.”

25137	8	Whoever gives in time gives twice.
25137	10	It seems that not only the tax system will be changed twice a year. The government is considering a double increase in the minimum wage by 2023 – in January to 3350 PLN, and from July to 3500 PLN. We don’t want to trigger a wolf from the forest and remind that in 2019 the ruling party promised an increase in the minimum wage by the end of 2023 to the level of 4,000 PLN. As you can see, the fight against inflation is going on a full pair.

25137	15	Before the climate debate, we have to stop.
25137	17	The World Economic Forum begins in Davos. In the media, the dominant topic was of course the consequences of the war in Ukraine. However, it should be noted that the main issues of the forum should be among others. After the pandemic and climate change. A bit of controversy raised the approach of the participants especially to this second topic. On the internet, there were pictures of the cars that were on the road to the Swiss resort. The passengers of these cars, after arriving at the destination, probably discussed a lot about the limitation of fossil fuels.

25137	31	Increasing fuel prices are becoming a driving force. Maybe to comfort that “they have worse” Money.pl published an article about the cost of tanking aircraft. For example, riding under such a Airbus costs more than 200 thousand. The aircraft costs 23 thousand dollars. liters of fuel. We only add that the tank burns up to 500 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers. The container burns 20 tons. What kind of comfort.

25137	36	Flowers with a slurry
25137	38	You can delay with a lot of things but give flowers for a few days, for example. After an important Jubilee it is very heavy and may have many unpleasant consequences of fall. Therefore, one of the companies engaged in the supply of flowers can not count on a lot of compassion, which has fallen under UOKiK. Her customers complained that she did not deliver on time (or at all) ordered for important holiday flowers. Moreover, in the sales regulations, the company has put down a clause, which in some situations removes the responsibility for the lack of time flowers. UOKIK said that it was not permitted. And rightly. Giving flowers day after day is sometimes worse than not giving them at all.

25137	43	Polish investment in innovation would be enough for Samsung
25137	45	There is a lot to say in Poland about the need to increase the cost of innovation. In 2020, 32 billion zlotys were spent on research and development in our country, and the reports on this topic proudly emphasized that over the course of 10 years, more than ten times the growth was recorded in our country. We will enjoy such a high dynamic but like a cold water cube, the information works on us, like the one announced by the Samsung Group. By 2026 it plans to increase the investments in semiconductors and biotechnology to a level of about $360 billion.

25137	50	We enter the world through doors and windows. The Polish Institute of Economics writes about the successes of the Polish construction table industry. The total share of the industry in the world’s exports of this type of products amounted to 16.1%. Our specialty is m.in. In 2021, Poland was the world leader in the export of plastic and wooden windows, reaching 36.2% respectively. and 28 percent. participation in global exports. In addition, she was a vice leader – after China – in the export of aluminum windows and doors with a share of 9.2%. And the third, after China and Brazil, exports wood door with a share of 8.3%.

25138	10	“I love the smell of the napalm in the morning,” said William ‘Bill’ Kilgore, one of the heroes of the famous ‘Apocalypse Time’. The supporter would also feel good in the silvestrove evening (and a few days later) in Poland, where after a yearly show of artificial fire, the swelling of burned fireworks is taken into the air for a long time. Pandemic is not a pandemic – many Poles (with the disappointment of the owners of animals) love the canyon. This is also seen in EU statistics. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland, 11,000 tons of fireworks were imported from the EU to Poland in 2019. The leader is Germany, which brought up to 38 thousand tons.
25138	12	Weekend 2-3 January
25138	14	It is not good
25138	16	The Ministry of Finance has published on its pages information about tax changes in 2021. As we know, in addition to a few beneficial, this year, a number of new solutions have entered into force, which, by saying, are not business-friendly. The Department of Communications does everything to not call things by name. When writing about the taxation of the CIT, the commodity companies use the expression “disruptive regulations”. And informing about the introduction of the trade tax, he is convinced that this tax is not new at all, because it has been introduced a few years ago but only its entry into force has been rejected. The way is reason. So much that this equilibristic word, whose purpose is to avoid at any cost the expressions of “new taxes” resembles a bit the dilemma of a certain leader of the house of culture from the time of the PRL. He was preparing a punk concert. Unfortunately, according to the punk style at that time, the team had a vulgar name “Pr...e”. The talented manager, however, escaped from this unhappy situation and wrote on the poster that the team will play “It’s not good.”

25138	22	Not just sugar is harmful to health.
25138	24	“I don’t see anything wrong in it. Sugar is unhealthy, so it should be subject to greater tax,” said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who was asked about the tax introduced since January for some sugar-containing products. As we know, it has caused. Increased prices of sweetened beverages. Some manufacturers are already combining with reducing the volume of bottles so that consumers do not raise so strongly higher prices on the shops. The commentators emphasize that the Polish sugar tax is extremely high (third high in Europe, after the UK and Ireland) and that it has not contributed at all in other countries to the reduction of the problem for example. the obesity.  Going through this troupe, you should expect taxation of chips, milk, bakery, coffee, margarine and many other products that are described in popular health advice as having a negative effect on the body. These ideas appeared a few years ago. The prime minister can only be reminded that, according to some, the most harmful to health is stress. They can cause it, etc. Increasing prices and taxes in shops. How to tax it?

25138	30	In the EU Official Journal, what you have to do today, do yesterday
25138	32	“Prokrastination is the result of a competition between the limbic system and the prostate cornea” – so scientifically describes a characteristic known to many people that consists in delaying doing something for later, often for the last moment. Some people try to joke with it saying, “What you have to do today do tomorrow, you’ll have two days of vacation.” But it is not always laughing. This is especially important in the case of public procurement. Many executives do this even for a few minutes before the specified deadline which is the cause of huge stress. This time, it’s not the late offerers but the contractors have fallen into the cylinder of procrastination. This is due to the new year’s changes in the Public Procurement Act. According to the Journal of Law, 300 large proceedings may be conducted unlawfully. Why? The contractors – among which there were many offices – who wanted to reach before the new rules enter into force and implement orders according to the existing rules, in some cases announced the proceedings on 31 December. They took their hands and went to Sylvester. The problem is, as the journal reports, that in the case of orders above the so-called EU limits – decide not the date of sending the announcement to the Official Journal of the EU, but the date of its publication. This may happen a few days later. So was this time. The effect is that the orders signed at the end of the new year have been published in January and theoretically should be implemented according to new regulations. This is a good lesson for those who seem to be able to break the system.

25138	37	Better less than more
25138	38	The Polish Agency for Entrepreneurship Development has praised its last year’s infolinic activity. In 2020, more than 100,000 consultations were conducted through it (telephone, e-mail, chat). What was the most frequently concerned by the consultation? Not completely known. According to PARP, the infolinia has been contacted by entrepreneurs who are looking for opportunities to finance their ideas. It is the clear side of the medal. It is known, however, that the great praise of phones to PARP is a request for clarification of complicated mechanisms for example. Subsidies in the EU programmes. We appreciate the effort and commitment of consultants supporting the infoline of state institutions such as PARP, ZUS, or the National Treasury Administration. They have an ungrateful job. But more cautiously we would take to praise the huge number of consultations provided. Of course, through infolinia, a lot of valuable information is provided, but its intense work and often overload is also the result – and above all – of unclear regulations, which must be explained to hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs.

25138	46	What is true is the information in the industry media appeared in the end of the year, but in the economic media it was still on the beginning of January so we notice it because it shows an important, new trend in the design of computers. The famous fast food, along with the manufacturer of peanut butter, has created a computer in the form of a chicken cup. The computer is equipped with the heating function. This allows you to enjoy a warm meal without having to go out to the kitchen. The idea has little to do with promoting a healthy and active lifestyle, but many players and lovers of American chicken will be thrilled.

Its purpose is m.in. “the development of the native industry and the increase in its innovation, as well as the increased resilience of the economy to shocks, such as a global pandemic.” The idea is good and the previous information indicates that the new policy will take into account many KIG proposals, at the beginning of the pandemic and related to, among other things. Independence from suppliers from Asia or stronger inclusion of Polish companies into global supply chains.

Money.pl describes the serious problem of the rising price of baking, which begins to reflect on small bakers, which so far have competed with quality with the offer of supermarkets. The article encountered the live reaction of the internet users. One of them writes about the situation in his favourite bakery: “Bread costs £14.00, but it has been reduced although the sellers claim that it is the same weight. Because I always take the same bag, in which the bread was hardly placed and even out of the bag, so now the bread takes half of the bag.” A comment can be a clue for sellers not to reduce the size of the bochets because customers will quickly get in mind. The way can be to give smaller bags – bochens will make the impression increasingly bigger.

The situation was so serious that the Boeing 747 was used for the emergency transport of raw materials for the manufacture of frites. I wonder how the problem will be resolved in Taiwan.

25139	47	Sardinia is missing rich Russians.
25139	49	The residents of Sardinia are missing the wealthy Russians, says Money.pl calling “Washington Post”. The EU’s sanctions against the Russian oligarchs have caused hundreds of workers in the Italian Sardinian region to remain unemployed and unable to accept the pressures. We are not surprised at all. The rich Russians – as shown in the anecdote below – can solve many local problems with their generosity. “A rich Russian arrived at a small hotel, the receptionist left 50 euros, reserving that he will look at the object and if he likes it, he will stay and if he doesn’t, he will take his money. While the guest visited the hotel, the receptionist took the receiving 50 euros a minute ago and ran to the baker, which he owes exactly the same amount. The baker took the money, after which he went to the baker, with whom he had a debt – also 50 euros. The taxpayer was pleased to hide the money in his pocket, but he recalled that he had a 50 euro debt to the taxi driver. He called him and returned his debt. The taxi driver took the money and went quickly to the hotel – the same one who was just watching the rich Russians. In the hotel, the taxi driver met the receptionist and gave him 50 euros he was liable for a recent stay in the hotel. The receptionist took the money into his hand – at that moment a rich Russians appeared, who pulled 50 euros out of his hand saying that the hotel did not respond to him and took his money. The Russians left the city and they were all happy because they paid their debts.”

25142	5	In the Russian language, it is the concept of “three” things, which is acquired. Something that is stolen from the victims of the war, stolen from the enemies, is trophy, that is, as if morally justified, stolen “honestly”. It is not a steal, it is a steal, it is a steal.
25142	7	The times are changing, during World War II, they were mainly bicycles and clocks. Today they are computers and AGD devices. For kitchen mixers, laptops and tosters kill people and destroy cities. It seems, when the Russian soldiers controlled Buč, they couldn’t get out of admiration that the Ukrainians’ apartments had laptops and...nutella. It was a symbol of great luxury.
25142	9	Felietonist Christophe Vargas wrathed that the West should swallow those luxury goods, such as kitchen mixers, tablets or scooters on the fields of Far Russia, Buryacy and Siberia, then there would not be war. The Russian soldier, pushed by tossers and nutells, is already so willing not to fight. This is, of course, only a malignant satire, because Putin decides, not a series, and this already has other, broader horizons of negligence.
25142	11	The Putin team is about gold seats and yachts, diamond jacuzzi and palaces. Therefore, the war will last, and the theft of soldiers will grow like a ceiling. Unfortunately.
25144	1	Study of Green Madness
25144	3	Today I am sitting in the office, simulating work-like activities. Radio in the background, and in it lies the refren of a certain song “Let go, paint my world, on yellow and blue...” and I begin to wonder if it’s still Poland or already Ukraine...
25144	5	However, I am removed from these thoughts by the uncle of Facebook, who suggests that today there is another protest of the residents on the Rzeszov market. The protest “to the expansion of the space of green areas in Rzeszov” is striking.
25144	7	This is a good news for anyone looking forward to interesting performances.
25144	9	Ultimately, when our president wanted to talk to the inhabitants about how wonderful and completely lacking of the overwhelming ideas of study for the city of Rzesov, he was even screamed. So by the way, you can congratulate him with the company that was very quickly evacuated from his surroundings as soon as it turned out that people didn’t come there to beat the tribes before the Majestate of the Office. Anyway, the protest under the windows of his rescue will surely rejoice the President – in the end it is worth being close to the voters.
25144	11	The current form of study will soon lead to a domestic war. Between the inhabitants, officials and developers, but I am something I think that someone in Ratus has stated that time to retire – and has proposed to leave what they have in this form. But it’s not so stupid, people scream what they don’t want, experts engaged by organizations for free will correct the errors and then the right people will collect it to the cup (some cup of sure) and voilà! Through the test of fire we will get ready solutions! And the voters are now screaming, and in a year few will remember what this whole scream was about.
25144	13	Please do so
25144	15	Well, unless on the way something else can be “successful” with the plans to restore our wonderful City. But it is impossible, right?
25144	17	So the study and the whole raban related to it is not the gift that Konrad Fijołek counted on the anniversary of his election to President Rzesov. It is on June 13. Well, although there are still culturalia on the way – you will be able to show up with a company of young, energetic people. Every “matenting” will say that it warms the image.
25144	19	It may not be like walking in dresses to the European Parliament, but it’s always something.
25144	21	Although the forecasts show to the inauguration of the cultural halls storms. However, it may not be sick a little. Well, but for students themselves it will not be a problem, although they wash the youth can move the mountains.
25144	23	Anna checked the weather on the wrong side. It rarely falls in Dubai.
25144	25	And so with a little different chap (this is not like a felieton, in which you can fight about everything and nothing) – I highly respect the pages with weather forecasts, because – unlike all others, especially those with information – they don’t steal each other content. Weather is always different in different places.
25144	27	In the end, I usually have an optimistic point. If you haven’t heard of it yet, another “matenting” genius has invented 500 plus for marriages. It’s good to know that in 37 years I’ll be waiting for a couple of extra hundred (which value until that time will fall to the rubber-ball area). And from completely unrelated news, the hears walk (How can the hears walk? The question to philosophers and my psychiatrists) that some gas stations set price pylons with four seats at prices. I don’t understand why the fuel prices will be given with accuracy up to 3 seats.
25144	29	Well, as TVP Info reports, it’s bad in the Norwegian state, because the gas is 13 PLN/litre. I hope that a country where the average monthly wage in 2022 is less than 23 000 PLN will somehow manage it. And we can always send them to the rescue of the Minister Sasina.
25145	1	You will no longer touch the sky.
25145	3	Today we celebrate the Day of the Child – as everybody is someone’s child, I wish everybody the best, the fulfillment of the dreams, and that Putin may dissolve this stupid river. Do not thank. 
25145	5	June 1 has always been associated with me with genuine sinfulness, colors, fun and such genuine childhood that everyone should experience. Of course, with age, teenagers begin to treat this more as an opportunity for a day free from school classes. Always something. But after school time to study – and entry into adult life.
25145	7	Beton for children
25145	9	So it happens that a few days ago (very) celebrated Minister Przemysław Czarnek wrapped in front of the rebuilt building of the rectorate of the University of Rzeszovsky. As a graduate of this first university, I decided to go under this building and I have to admit that it perfectly fits in how the entry of young Poles into adult life in our country looks.
25145	11	Grey, concrete clay, almost without windows, resembling a court or prison clay. Anyone who will study in such a place will feel the joy of living in Poland. When I studied at the UR, I always felt that I missed something – I thought it was about the modern equipment of the halls and the normal hours of classes. I was wrong, it was about concrete in the main building.
25145	13	In order not to be made too concrete, it is worth mentioning that a new tree appeared quite quickly on the rash market. Maybe it looks pretty modest – especially like a plant for a few tens of thousands of dollars – but I guess they won’t exaggerate the tree in the flowering. In the next year, there will be a lot of fun and fun.
25145	15	Where did the parasols go?
25145	17	A propos entertainment on our market – as a result of the nationwide CBSP campaign, some Go-Go clubs, including the Touch the Sky, were closed. I could write something about the untouched loss (and those “righteous parasols”...) but nature does not suffer emptiness and someone will surely fill that hole.
25145	19	For this, no one will rather fill the hole in our portfolios, as Tusk believes, continuously raising prices at the gas stations. You can always go on a walk to react, it will be cheaper. Only not in the top – recently on the German portal Zeit.de you could read the article pt. Right Wanderlust (Right Wanderlust) In this article he says that if you like mountain tourism, then you are probably a fascist. People learn something every day.
25145	21	And the person from whom each of us can learn something is Senator Stanisław Karcewski, who earns modest 37 thousand. It works for the idea every month, on Saturday and Sunday. This is a great way to follow by our children. Another person whose words are worth knowing is Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin – also known as Polish Midas – in a conversation with Polish Radio who said “carbon will not be missing. In the autumn this coal will surely be available to individual customers.” Now we know what to expect. And the certainty about the future is very important when inflation reaches 14% and begins to taste like good wine.
25145	23	But it is also worth adding that despite the small difficulties in life in Poland, in the West is worse, what TVP Info perfectly presents – for example in France we have the highest inflation since 1985. Not to jealousy.
25145	25	Total of 5.2%. Indeed, not to jealousy.
25146	1	Moravian Prime Minister is so antisemitic as the Ukrainian Nazis
25146	3	The peaceful French dog recovered the harshness and swallowed. No, Putin, he can only complaint with him. “Mateus Morawiecki is an extremely right-wing anti-Semit who excludes LGBT people,” Emmanuel Macron said in Le Parisien. This caused a slight consternation of the Polish opposition, because Macron scarified her most radical statements, because the idea to accuse the prime minister of anti-Semitism did not even fall. And the most important thing: not now! But covering a French dog is a valuable event, because it shows what the whole campaign for the dictatorship in Poland was. Yes, what Ambassador Mosbacher recently suggested: part of the same campaign, what the calling of the Ukrainians by the Nazis – writes for the portal Independent.pl Piotr Lisiewicz.
25146	5	You have wondered over the past few years, why is Poland called a dictatorship, although the ruling party gets a mandate from the Poles in the next elections? Why do people argue about the lack of freedom of speech in Poland, although most media support the opposition? Why is the attempt to build a dimension of justice not loaded by political judgments from the times of communism, the tossing of affairs and the extremely pathological arrangements, negatively assessed by the Poles, someone can call it a struggle with the rule of law? 
25146	7	Why did they fall when they were called black white? When the majority of the Poles listened to them, they fell into their heads.  The answer is as simple as scary. It would be possible to bomb Polish cities. They were warned Poland so that no one wanted to defend it, to help it. And if it fails to bomb, it is even because its position does not count after the attack on Ukraine. Because it was known that Poland will stand, it will force other countries to realize what the Polish Prime Minister well defined: “Sanktions are to bring peace to Ukraine, not peace to the unclean conscience of Europe. The sanctions are to stop Putin. If this does not happen, it means that the sanctions do not work.”
25146	9	“It’s time to say this loudly – when it comes to the problems with the rule of law, much of what came to the West was the result of Russian dezinformation,” Ms. Mosbacher wrote. I have to say more. The press on the dictatorship in Poland was part of the campaign that made the Ukrainians Nazi. And the participation of German media and foundation was not accidental. It’s enough to track the sources of this dezinformation and everything is seen as on your hand.
25146	11	The “totality” of the opposition came from the fact that PiS’s dispute with the opposition is not similar to the competition between Republicans and Democrats or the CDU and the SPD. Not the amount of taxes the usual issues are the most important in it. It is primarily a dispute between the possibility of Poland’s independence and the alliance of the Middle East states cooperating with the United States. And the Russian-German lobby, within which Russia is capable of the worst bestials and genocides.
25146	13	And so above all: whoever sympathized with the actions of the Fighting Solidarity, hears in those days in the words of Matthew Morawiecki the echo of the words of Kornel Morawiecki, who proclaims the ideas of the brotherhood of nations and of solidarity. The Son carries out the work designed by the Father, as well as the Autonomous Department of Eastern Fighting Solidarity, led by Jadwiga Chmielowska and Peter Hlebowicz.
25146	15	"Matthew Morawiecki in his master's work on Struggling Solidarity wrote: ""Solidarity in concrete manifestations of social life, life for everyday life should be a realization of Christian ideas of neighbor's love. “Solidarity is a form of the way of society towards (...) a new (...) system, which will undoubtedly contain the main values brought by the Union – i.e. democracy and actual (...) social love.” The idea of solidarity is an attempt to transfer the principles of respect, understanding and love between individuals into relations between national, social or political groups. Solidarity was indeed a challenge for the individualist, usual, western capitalism, but it was, above all, a counterproposal for the unhuman communist system.”"
25146	17	That’s what the Polish anti-Semitists do not know, of course, Emmanuel Macron.
25147	1	Nazi Razi
25147	3	The first pages of the newspapers, popular “single”, should attract the attention of the readers. The most unpleasant uniforms.
25147	6	Years ago, the Weekly “In the Network” called on journalists to stop the “historic campaign of hate”, in the “temate” of pedophilia among priests. And the illustrative cover was found by the chief editor of “Newsweek” Tomasz Lis, presented in the uniform of the SS soldier with the signature: “H like Goebbels.”
25147	9	We don’t miss Goebbels. Even the head of the “No” weekly magazine has been worried after the courts for a few years for the “Goebbel’s state of war.”
25147	12	We are pleased to quote for that. Recently winning opposition journalist Waldemar Kuczinsky, threw into the network of consideration: “Why does this ‘democratic’ press, dependent on foreign centers, not see how wonderfully we are changing the country? Why can’t he see how much social programs give, how we restore morality after the plague created by the predecessors?” It was a quote, and how, from Joseph Goebbles in 1934.
25147	15	After years, however, Jacek Karnowski and the “Sets” have to apologize for the photo of Thomas Lisa in the Nazi uniform. After eight years of publication, the justice has overwhelmed the reports.
25147	18	In all this, it is surprising how often we like references to history. Not the latest anymore. Hitler came to power in 1933, and it was a little bit over. Historyists also remind that Adolf appeared on the Time Week on January 2, 1939, because he was awarded the title of the Man of the Year in 1938. The war ended seven decades ago. But this topic is still up to date. Only in the last period, the head of the Wrocław IPN was appointed a lacking historian. The bestseller was Mein Kampf. They are making another touch.
25147	21	Something is on things. At the same time, The Facto said: “We love the literature of the fact. Unfortunately, the Polish publisher’s offer in this segment is poor – except books dedicated to the biography of Adolf Hitler, the women of Hitler, Hitler’s fighters, Hitler’s generals, Hitler’s agents, Hitler’s architects, Hitler’s dogs, Hitler’s bunker, Hitler’s diet, Hitler’s attacks, Hitler’s allies, Hitler’s tanks, Hitler’s secret weapons, Hitler’s doctors, and Goering’s clothes. There is no doubt Hitler-amateur has something to dress in. Worse with a reader who would like to relax from the struggles and struggles on the east front.”
25147	24	The press reader cannot rest, however, and it breaks it, he calls the chart.
25147	27	More modern Germans, they will not leave the comparisons to brownness. The weekly “Stern” showed President Trump in the Nazi poem. Angela Merkel on the “Der Spiegel” cover? There is no matter. Macron is like Hitler. Please very much. The Le Monde newspaper took care of this and accelerated with such a cover. What about the Czech Republic, should it be worse? In the popular “Refleks” weekly, the face of the leader was placed with a coat, to this black, with a boiling afro cheek.
25147	30	"The weekly “Right” is the palm of Hitler’s priority. Title: The German Trojan Horse. And on her Erika Steinbach in a well-known uniform, sitting on Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. The only ""Heil Lepper"" with the chairman of the Self-Defense in the main role, had to excite Andrei Lepper, who demanded even a million zlotys of compensation. “They want to oversee Poland again,” and in front of the new edition of the week, European politicians are hanging over the map. Merkel in the leadership. This is a reference to the famous picture of Hitler and the generals on the staff maps."
25147	33	The newspaper also didn’t want to be there. Graphics with Donald Tusk in Nazi uniform. Do you not agree with whom? very difficult. The Bingo. with Angela Merkel. They left the tram with the inscription “nur für Deutsche”. What other one should you go out of? the independence? Christophe Stanowski tweeted:
25147	36	“1 Take attention to the Polish disappearance camps in the media. Support the photomontage of the former Prime Minister of the Republic of Germany in the German uniform from the 2nd World Cup. The logic?”
25147	39	Back to Thomas Lisa. The publisher and chief editor, contrary to the judgment of the topic, apologize but do not intend. There is no longer a “network” day. The “net” is. There is no such city in London. It is land. The land.
25147	42	I don’t know what the lawyers are doing.
25147	45	But please imagine the situation that you were in the house of “U Zdzicha” and were stuck there with yellow salad or eggs in mayonnaise. They wanted compensation for gastrointestinal disorders. The independent court recognized it. But attention. The Lord “U Zhrcha” has changed its name to “Zdzisek” and you can jump to us. to the shock.
25147	48	or on a war topic. Germany could not pay war compensation. However, the losses and damages caused by armed actions, did not RFN only III Reich. This is obvious, right?
25149	1	The storm around the Neo-Nova has not yet drowned. 
25149	3	It has been a week of discussion about the Neo-Nova sketch, which has caused emotions among the Poles. The opinion was shared by Monika Olejnik.
25149	5	For a week, Poland has been discussing the cabaret of Neo-Novka. It was a huge excitement among the Poles. First, a storm on the internet exploded, which in the following stages caught politicians and political scientists.
25149	7	Today there is no more to hide that the scene from the life of the Poles presented by the Neo-Nowka has become a pure policy. It is not excluded that the motivation will be used by any of the parties seeking to place the middle of political dispute in the upcoming election campaign.
25149	9	But it was politized by PiS spokesman Radoslav Fogiel, who rather wants to go to war with the members of the cabinet than to turn the whole situation into a joke. This even more warmed the political context of Noah-Nova's Cossal's speech, and the politicians and the cabinet began to respond to Fogl. The spokesman breathed a ball, which is already a snowball.
25149	11	Monika Olejnik shared her observations in her latest felieton for “The Electoral Gazette”. As the journalist emphasizes, the Cossalin audience was daring to dissolve at the accompaniment of the oklasks.
25149	13	Vulgarianism may not fit with some, but this cabinet is the whole truth about our reality. No one has lost the staff for the ballaganian work, no one has lost the staff for the fact that we pay penalties every day. The enemy is Tusk, not Zbigniew Ziobro, through which Poland does not receive billions of gold – we read.
25149	15	Then Monika Olejnik compares the country's departure by the politicians of the power camp to the cabinet.
25149	17	President Kaczynski attacked the country, attacking the Germans, the same does Mateusz Morawiecki. Like in the cabinet. They are looking for enemies as in the Gomula times, when for everything it was possible to blame Germany – he writes on the “Voting” page.
25149	19	A genius appearance, though how to think that after a foolish change you will have to turn off all these inserts from your knees.. then the willingness to laugh passes – commented one of the readers of “The Electoral Gazette”.
2515	2	Law on Compulsory Vaccinations
2515	4	Our proposal for mandatory vaccines against COVID-19 is a attempt to force the government to act, which wants to anticipate the pandemic, said Lewica club chairman Krzysztof Gawkowski.
2515	6	“We need to introduce the vaccination obligation, so that people are healthy, so that they don’t die, so that we don’t have such a mortality rate,” Gawkowski told TVN 24. “Open, wise, responsible party, like the Lewica, wants to submit proposals, not to wait; the government wants to anticipate the pandemic. “There is no consent,” he said.
2515	8	“European solutions show that if we have different types of restrictions, they affect the fact that there are more vaccinations,” he added.
2515	10	"Gawkowski alleged that ""health ministers and government coalition abdicated the pandemic fight""; he also noted that last week health minister Adam Niedzielski did not participate in ""three important health debates"" in the Sejm."
2515	12	He also stressed that vaccinations against certain diseases are also currently mandatory in Poland, and parents who do not vaccinate their children are threatened with penalties. According to Gawkowski, in case of introduction of a vaccination obligation against COVID-19 the penalty for avoiding it should be - just as in case of avoiding the vaccination obligation for children - several hundred zlotys.
2515	14	The announcement of the draft law on this matter the head of the club of Lewica justified by the fact that the proposal to regulate this by the regulation remained unanswered.
2515	16	On Sunday, Lewica presented a draft law on the obligation to vaccinate against COVID-19 for adults; non-vaccinated persons would be subject to a fine. The leaders of the party have called on other formations to support this solution.
2515	18	PSL: Vaccination obligation is based on the Ministry of Health Regulation
2515	20	Kosiniak-Kamysz was asked at Rp.pl if the coalition of Poland-PSL would support the Lewica project if it came to the Sejm. “The obligation to vaccinate is not stipulated in the law, it is only based on the Ministry of Health’s regulations,” he said.
2515	22	"""We have 14 diseases that are covered by mandatory vaccines against it: membrane, cartilage, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis B,"" PSL leader said. “It really works well, and the health minister has the best knowledge, it should have, if it is competent, effective, responsible – that’s how it happens and that’s how it then includes a certain disease on the list of mandatory vaccines,” he added. “This is in the direction of the Minister (Adama) Sunday. I expect a statement from him. It is expected to fulfill the recommendations of the Medical Council, to hear the doctors, not the surveys,” he said."
2515	24	"Asked whether COVID-19 should be the fifth disease that is included in the list of mandatory vaccines, Kosiniak-Kamysz replied: ""It is a infectious disease, spreading in such uncontrolled way, is an effective vaccine."" “There is no more tested vaccine than vaccines against COVID-19, there is no larger fields of research than now on vaccines against COVIDU, because there are millions, dozens, hundreds of millions of people already vaccinated around the world, so it gives the enormous safety value of this vaccine,” he added."
2515	26	“This is the decision of the Minister of Health,” said Kosiniak-Kamysz. “If the government’s analysis of the Center for Strategic Analysis shows that it should be introduced, then let the Minister of Health take this decision as soon as possible,” he added.
2515	28	Asked whether he would be a health minister or whether he would make such a decision, the people’s leader replied: “As we will co-govern, we will make decisions.” “Today the opposition is not from that because there is no such knowledge to dismiss the rulers,” he added.
2515	30	Kosiniak-Kamysz pointed out that a serious approach to vaccination obligation should be taken against doctors, DPS employees and teachers.
2515	32	Levica Ambassador Adrian Zandberg said on Sunday that to restore control over the healthcare situation, mandatory vaccines, covid passports and restrictions are needed for non-vaccinated persons. Employees should be entitled to refuse to perform their duties in a situation where they do not have an epidemic safety at work.
2515	34	Ministry of Health: Volunteering
2515	36	“Since the beginning of the pandemic, I think that there should be volunteering that everyone should decide about his life and health. Certain restrictions are necessary. But if it’s just forced to vaccinate, I’d think about it,” said Vice-President Waldemar Kraska.
2515	38	"He said the government could consider ""forced vaccination of certain professional groups, we are talking here about medical staff."" “The new data we have is the level of vaccination of doctors at 92 percent and 81 percent. the nurses. Here we can get better resistance,” Kraska said."
2515	40	The Ministry of Health said that on the next meeting of the Council on 8-9 December, the draft law on the Compensation Fund will be processed.
2515	42	Kraska was also asked for a suggestion of the health department before Christmas. A year ago, representatives of the government, the Ministry of Health called on to limit the excursions for Christmas and to meet only in the group of the nearest few people.
2515	44	“The most important thing is to get vaccinated. This day will be warmer and safer. I wish this to all the Poles that we meet on Christmas as people vaccinated,” the deputy deputy said.
2515	46	He said, “This is not the way.”
2515	48	The journalists asked the deputy chairman of the PO, Thomas Siemoniak, on Monday if he could support this law. “I’m a supporter of vaccines, I’m alone after the third dose, I’m taking others,” said Vice-President of the PO Tomasz Siemoniak. “By appreciating the good intentions of the designers, I think this is not the way. It’s not a coincidence that only in one country, and it’s only since February, such a system of compulsory vaccines is introduced,” he added.
2515	50	According to him, the government, which does the vaccine campaign without conviction, should do much more. “To force someone is the end, especially that it will lead to the flowering of the grey zone. We already hear about false certificates,” he said. He also noted that such a obligation does not require a law, but a regulation, and such a regulation can be issued by the Minister of Health.
2515	52	“Let’s look for positive solutions,” Siemoniak called. “But we’ll see when the project is ready, what solutions will be there,” he said.
2515	54	For now, as he added, the government does very little, the government’s commissioner ds. The vaccination has disappeared, there is no cooperation with the Church, and the booklets to the boxes are sent on Polish Lada, not on vaccines. He added that in Portugal, which is culturally and materially close to Poland, there are about 90 percent of the vaccines.
25150	1	Not Black, not Najman, and Anna-Maria Zhukowska. Winner of an unusual competition
25150	3	Anna Maria-Zhukowska from Lewica won this year’s competition for the “Biological Blur of the Year”. “There are situations that a biological man is giving birth to a child.”
25150	5	Not every nomination for a different type of plebiscite is a reason for pride. There are competitions in which the presence among the nominated is not what we would like to praise on a family meal or a evening meeting with friends. This was the case with Anna-Maria Zhukovskaya.
25150	7	23 per cent. Internet users have decided that this year’s award for the “Biological Blur of the Year” will be in the hands of the members of the Lewica. “There are situations that a biological man is giving birth to a child.” The quote comes from one of the programs on the TVP Info antenna. What is this morality? It can be said that it is better not to appear in the TVP.
25150	9	It has left a strong competition. On the stage of the contest were Jan Duda and his theory of homosexuality that can be infected, as well as Marcin Najman, who in the vaccines of AstraZeneka and Johnson & Johnson found the cells of the killed child. Following the fate of Nayman's career, this lack of victory should not exactly surprise anyone.
25150	11	Last year, Kaja Godek won for saying that “there is nothing like orientation.” There is no such city as London. In his way, the pro-life activist could take this plebiscite an honorary patronate.
25151	1	Silver for Sunday (for silence is gold)
25151	3	France will pay
25151	5	"National Union leader Marine Le Pen, who arrived in Poland at the Warsaw Summit, the meeting of the leaders of 13 European right-wing parties, referred to the actions of the Polish government in the dispute with Brussels in an interview for the ""Rzeczpospolitej"". Moreover, she declared that: “TSUE has imposed a million euros a day penalty on Poland for violating the rule of law. France will pay the penalty for Poland. We are a net payer to the EU budget and we will take away those costs from our surplus.” Mr. Le Pen is on the presidential election in his country. I wonder if its voters have already learned about the interview and what they think about paying the bills for PiS. I have an unclear disappointment that from such statements the slopes of support for the golden Marine strongly will not increase..."
25151	7	Warsaw in Budapest? pleasantly!
25151	9	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who also visited the Warsaw Summit in Warsaw, failed in trying to appeal the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union to the Hungarian Constitutional Court. The EU has issued a judgment against Hungary in December 2020 in connection with the European Commission’s complaint that their asylum regulations violate EU law. The Orban Government has submitted the TSUE judgment to the Hungarian Constitutional Court. Unfortunately, it turned out that the Hungarian Constitutional Court ruled that: “It is unable to suspect the judgments of the TSUE or to examine the superiority of EU law.” We advise Prime Minister Orban to go to Warsaw in the event of a further dispute with the TSUE. There already Mrs. Julia Priłębska will not only make the judgment after his thought, but also make a delicious gourmet cooking...
25151	11	Experimental horror
25151	13	Vice-Ministry of Infrastructure Marcin Horaela, and at the same time Head of the Central National Shepherd, spoke about vaccines against COVID-19 in the “Express Biedrzycka” program. He said that they were “experimental” because: “Normally, the research on vaccines lasted many years, and in this case there was no time to do so.” Moreover, Mr. Horala stated that: “Of course, the limitation of the development of the epidemic and the protection of human health and life are important, but values such as personal freedom and the right to be responsible for themselves are also extremely important and protected by constitution.” How much love for the constitution and what kind of love for freedom is in the heart of Mr. Vice-Ministry... I wonder, has he already swallowed himself within a civil attitude?
25151	15	Christmas break
25151	17	Deputy Minister of Sport Lukas Mejza, according to Virtual Poland, founded the Vinci NeoClinic Company in 2020. The company offered m.in. Treatment of unhealing by modern medicine of cancer and neurological diseases. She was also supposed to help with autism, stroke, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, disturbance, muscle disappearance. For such an extensive offer, she demanded a $80,000 increase. Mr. Mejza, instead of resigning after such a scandal, took a curious defense through an attack on independent media and the opposition. Then, as obviously he didn’t convince anyone, he wrecked himself from the light and went on a vacation. He wrote on Facebook: “As a result of the unforgivable media attack on me on a political background, on Wednesday’s briefing I announced the submission of dozens of lawsuits/proclamations, which I have realized and I continue to realize. In order to fully dedicate myself to the struggle for my good name, truth and justice in the coming weeks, I will suspend my participation in the work of the Ministry of Sports and Tourism. I also went to the Seymour marshals for a vacation from the performance of my ministerial duties.” Hmmm, but if the Minister of Mejza is aware that in order to defend a good name, you must first have it...
25151	19	Roman Untouched
25151	21	Roman Giertych has been preparing a lawsuit to the Hague Court against the U.S. government for several weeks. However, he was recently called again to the prosecutor's office in connection with an investigation on the withdrawal of money from the stock company. In order to supplement the accusations. Indeed, the court has already issued a ruling that there is no basis for the proceedings and arrest of Mr. Roman and the use of other preventive measures. However, the prosecutor has stated that if the lawyer does not appear before the investigators again, he intends to request a temporary arrest. In response to the position of the Prosecutor’s Office, Giertych recalled that the courts ruled no basis for his arrest and declared that he would not continue to put on calls. It’s hard, but I’m going to bet on the roman!
25151	23	Walls for Mundurem
25151	25	Jacek Kurski, chairman of TVP, came to a great idea. To support the soldiers serving at the border, he decided to organize a concert “Murem for the Polish Mundure”. This patriotic party for soldiers, which is on the ground 23. The Tactical Aviation Base in Minsk Mazowieckim, has become one of the most expensive stations in history. President Kurski didn’t save on a concert for soldiers, so he spent a fortune even greater than he planned for this year’s Sylvester at TVP. Foreign stars (which is a bit forgotten), such as Oceana or Loona, did not admire the viewers who were dismissed by the choice of a dance repertoire for a patriotical occasion. However, they received 100,000 for the performance, although they sang from the playback. The situation was not saved by even the immortal Edita Górniak, who belonged to those few who dared to sing alive. Good TVP!

25152	3	Richard Henry
25152	5	Ryszard Czarnecki is undoubtedly very profitable and preventive, especially in financial matters. So last year, in addition to the salary from the European Parliament, paid in euros, he also receives transfers from the Polish Football Association, where he is vice president of the European Parliament. International since April 2018. He declared that he would work there charitatively, with pure love for the network, but as they give him 10 thousand dollars a month, he will not refuse. In addition, PZPS can also be rushed to kilometers, so it would be bad not to use it. Ryszarda Czarneck's car trips cost Polish Union of Siatkova at least 75 thousand zlotys, and according to the documents, only in the period between mid-November last year and the end of May 2021, the European man tanked at the expense of PZPS almost 100 times and put into the bag of his service Citroën C5 Aircross more than 3,5 thousand liters of diesel. If you believe the results of the combustion tests of this model of the car, the politician could pass about 55 thousand kilometers in a half year. It would turn around the Earth along the equation and begin a new circle.

So PAD stated that it is uncertain whether observing the recent decrease in the number of infections: “We can really enjoy that it is the effect of vaccination, or that it is simply the effect of that we have such and not other weather conditions.” And he continued in the same spirit: “Can we talk about the fact that if the number of diseases in my country, in Poland, has fallen at this moment to the level daily as we noted exactly a year ago, that is between 200 and 400 cases every day, then can we really enjoy that it is the effect of vaccination, or is it simply the effect that such and not other we have atmospheric, weather conditions, [that] this is the time of the year? We had no vaccines last year, and the cases were the same.” Antibacterians beat Andrzej Dudze bravo.

25152	13	Monika Olejnik invited to “Kropki nad i” the senator, Tomasz Grodzki and during the conversation asked him about the case of the attack on the mailbox of the Minister of State. Marshalek said: “This is a very serious matter and at least those who have exposed the security of the state should consider whether to stop their activities in the government. “If we add that the Vice-President for Security (Jarosław Kaczynski) on a secret session of the Sejm speaks about the plans of Russia’s invasion of Poland, then I don’t imagine that the President would not call the National Security Council in an urgent manner.” The journalist asked the question: “Is Jaroslav Kaczynski an outstanding politician?”Marsalek said after a short thought: “Some people use their intelligence for a bad purpose.” The exchange of views on President Andrzej Dudy has no sense to add.

The results of the survey are also intended for scientific research. In an open letter to the Malopolitan curator rector UJ Professor Jacek Popiel wrote that knowing her earlier statements, he does not expect apologies for the words expressed in the members of the academic community.
25152	19	Although she wanted it, she did not get it.
25152	21	The Senators in majority voted against the PiS supported candidate Lydia Staroń for Civil Rights Attorney. Unfortunately, the result was affected by her regrettable speech before the vote and the lack of answers to the questions of the senators. Asked by the journalists, Senator said, “I’m not sorry, I’m very pleased to be a candidate.” And asked about the causes of the failure, she said, “As it is fighting for people, and not in one party or another, that’s what it is.” Well, if the main motivation of the candidature was the fact that he “will very much”, then there is no wonder.

25153	9	The article published by the scientific magazine “The Lancet” shows that Dutch scientists have managed to determine exactly how many patients still suffer from chronic disease after the disease. The UMC staff conducted a survey of 13,000 people. The population of the Netherlands is 12.7 percent. Patients still suffered from disorders within three to five months after infection.
25153	11	“These included mainly chest pain, loss of moisture and taste, fatigue and muscle pain,” said Professor Judith Rosmalen, head of the team, who conducted the study.

25156	1	Our generosity knows no boundaries. More than $26 billion to help Ukrainians
25156	3	About 10 billion zlotys is the estimated value of the private expenditure of the Poles for aid to refugees from Ukraine in the first months of the war, according to a report from the Polish Economic Institute. Public expenditure is estimated at about 15.9 billion. Public, or paid from our pockets.
25156	5	“The estimated total annual expenditure of the public authorities to help refugees along with the amount of private expenditure of the Poles incurred for this purpose only during the first three months of the war is a total of 25.4 billion PLN,” said Piotr Arak, director of the PIE. He added that this corresponds to 0.97%. Polish GDP in 2021.
25156	7	In terms of public expenses related to ensuring refugees access to benefits and social assistance, as well as the possibility of healthcare and education, it is approximately 15.9 billion PLN.
25156	9	Relationship and money transfers
25156	11	According to PIE, in the first few months, 70 percent of the aid activities were involved. Adults, and half were engaged in helping refugees in a consistent way, i.e. both at the beginning of the war and in the following weeks of armed activities.
25156	13	The most popular forms of support – as the Polish Economic Institute expert Agnieszka Wincewicz-Price indicated – were case assistance and money transfers. According to the report, 59 percent. The researchers were involved in the purchase of the necessary items, and 53 percent. They paid money to the refugees. “The less frequently used forms of support were the assistance to deal with different types of refugee affairs (20 percent). Volunteering and Volunteering (17 percent) and examined). In turn 7 percent. The researchers said they had made their own apartment available to the refugees,” Wincewicz-Price said.
25156	15	According to the study, the Poles spent 9-10 billion PLN on refugees. It is also noted that this is more than charitable expenditure throughout 2021.
25156	17	Commitment quite common, regardless of earnings
25156	19	It is estimated that among people with the highest income (more than 5,000). The percentage of people who provided the highest aid to refugees was three times higher than those with the lowest income (less than 2,000). The ZL. It was also noted that even among those who earn net less than 2,000. The number of people involved in the aid was quite common, and only 26 percent. People from this group did not help in any way. It was also noted that the level of educational assistance was important. People with higher education were more involved in the aid (about 10 points. and proc. more compared to other people).
25156	21	It was shown that with a strong commitment to helping the Ukrainians the association also had factors such as: experience in pre-war charitable activities, direct contact with foreigners (including especially Ukrainians) before the war and regular tracking media information about the war activities and the fate of refugees. Interestingly, women are engaged more often than men in helping refugees. The total lack of involvement in aid describes 28%. Men, with only 19 percent. the women. In turn, taking into account the age, it turns out that among the younger people there was the most strongly engaged, but also the most unhelpful – 27 percent. People aged 20-34 did not help refugees at all (but up to 18 percent). They can be qualified as strongly engaged in bringing assistance.” – it is written.
25156	23	Now we have to deal with them.
25156	25	The report’s authors pointed out that over time the number of people actively engaged in refuge aid has decreased. In April and May, 57 percent. The respondents declared participation in some form of aid actions (in the beginning of the conflict it was 70 percent. of adults). It is noted that up to 50 percent. It indicated the involvement both at the beginning of the war and in the later period when the investigation was carried out.
25156	27	It was also noted that the aid of the Polish society in the first days and weeks of the war was not only material but largely symbolic, because in many cases it preceded institutional aid and significantly influenced the formation of public opinion in other countries. “In the next phase, defined by the authors of the report as adaptation, the constant role of the state is crucial, as it was necessary to integrate refugees into the socio-state system by enabling access to public and social infrastructure and providing institutional support,” the report said.
25156	29	In the next stage of integration, it will be necessary to ensure social cohesion, to mitigate social tensions between the new immigration and the Polish society, and to enable smooth integration in schools, public institutions, workplaces and everywhere there is intense contact between refugees and Polish citizens.
25157	1	Ukrainians make up 8% of Poland’s population, in Wroclaw – 28%
25157	3	Although the number of Ukrainians in Poland fell to 3.37 million in May, they still make up 8 percent. The people of the country – on Monday the Journal of Law. The DGP was based on the results of the latest report submitted by the Union of Polish Metropolities (UMP), an organization gathering the 12 largest cities of the country.
25157	5	Data based on the analysis of information from smartphones and the PESEL number register (a list of numbers obtained by the Ukrainians since the Russian invasion on February 24) give an image of both the Ukrainian immigrants before the war and the last wave of refugees.
25157	7	According to the data, in most of the cities surveyed, the number of Ukrainians fell after the February summit, with two exceptions – Wroclaw and Warsaw. The UMP report also shows which cities are proportionally the most Ukrainians.
25157	9	On the bottom of the ranking is Bydgoszcz and Lodž, where Ukrainians make up 10 percent. the residents. In the case of Wroclaw it is 28 percent, and in Warsaw it is 16 percent, although in absolute values the highest number is in the capital.
25157	11	The highest percentage of Ukrainians compared to the population is in Rzeszov (37 percent).“It is possible to wonder how much Rzeszov and its surroundings are just a stop on the route to other places in Poland and Europe, and how much it is where Ukrainian refugees are inclined to return relatively quickly to their country.”
25158	1	A controversial opinion of the German government. “Not only Russia, but the United States is evil.”
25158	3	The Transport Minister of Baden-Württemberg Winfried Hermann from the Green Party has placed a rather controversial opinion in his work dedicated to the war. He says that in connection with the war in Ukraine, the roles of Russia and the West are too unilaterally perceived. According to him, not only Russia is “warfare” and “bad”, and U.S. interventions have brought a lot of destruction instead of peace and democracy.
25158	5	“The armed conflicts and war involvement over the past 30 years do not justify the image that only Russia is a warrior and a evil in repeated investigation of its interests through military force,” Hermann wrote in the dedicated labor war, which the DPA agency met. “Specific U.S. interventions have brought a lot of destruction instead of peace and democracy,” the author said.
25158	7	“The United States has violated international law.
25158	9	Since the end of the Soviet Union, Russia has carried out brutal wars with violations of international law, with proven war crimes in the alleged areas of Russia’s interests, for example in Chechnya, Georgia and Syria. However, the United States – supported by NATO countries such as France, Britain and Germany – intervened in the same period “with a concentrated military force and partially also with a violation of international law in Iraq, Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, etc.“”
25158	11	Hermann also criticized “unused opportunities for peace” after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty. The opportunity for a new “control and disarmament security architecture that also takes into account the interests of former Soviet states and Russia” has been overlooked for NATO’s expansion to the east.
25158	13	Reply of the Ukrainian diplomat 
25158	15	Former Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, commented the comments on Twitter: “Instead of relativizing the disgraceful war crimes of Russia in Ukraine, you should rather worry about overwhelmed regional trains.”
25159	1	The French government decided. The Ambassador Ds. LGBT+ rights
25159	3	French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne has announced his appointment as ambassador to France. LGBT+ rights and a fund of €3 million for the creation of new LGBT+ centers. Moreover, the French government does not exclude the granting of compensation to persons previously persecuted for sexual orientation.
25159	5	The position of the ambassador. LGBT+ is expected to be created by the end of the year. There will be 10 new LGBT+ centers, besides 35 already existing.
25159	7	Borne announced her decision on Thursday during a visit to the LGBT+ center in Orlean on the 40th anniversary of the abolition of discriminating homosexual relations against the heterosexual codes introduced by the Vichy regime.
25159	9	According to the Prime Minister, the ambassador will “coordinate the activities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protect against discrimination and promote LGBT+ rights and will bring the voice of France in the world”, in particular speaking for the “universal depenalization of homosexuality and transgender identification”.
25159	11	On the other hand, the draft law presented by the socialist senator Hussein Bourgeois requires compensation for persons convicted of homosexuality between 1942 and 1982. Borne warned that he would look at the document. Treating the wounds that could have been assigned by discrimination is not an easy topic, she added.
25159	13	In 1942, the Vichy regime introduced a law that recognizes homosexual relations with people under 21 years of age as a crime. At the same time, the permission age for heteroseksual persons was 15 years. In 1974, the age of consent for homosexuals was raised to the age of 18. In 1982, it was equated to the limit for heterosexual relationships.
2516	2	Thomas Pietryga: The Case of Sylvia Spurek
2516	4	The behavior of the eurodeputate shows well that ecophanatism can lead to the dehumanization of the world view.
2516	6	Sylvia Spurek, a former deputy spokesman for civil rights, just before the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where about 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, were killed, allowed to post on social media the painting of the artist Jo Frederik showing the cows in the camps, with stars on the chest, carried on scenes. He says, “It gives you the mind to think, it opens your eyes to how we treat animals.” “It’s time for a serious discussion about the treatment of animals, the conditions in which they live, how we kill them...”
2516	8	The group has an unreliable attitude in this matter. In the course of a year, the domestic violence victims’ rights activist passed into an ecologist who took the animal defense standards. The famous recording in which she protested during a campaign to the European Parliament against the “violence” of mammals, and several statements in a similar tone, seemed to be an extreme approach. However, it is clear that the tendency to extremism of the European Parliament has no boundaries.
2516	10	You can understand the arguments of ecologists who often call drastic examples to move human conscience. It is always a matter of balance and proportion. The Holocaust is the worst material for such comparisons. There are spheres from which happeners should stay away. Respect for the importance of these events. These issues seem to be obvious to civilized people. But not for everyone. The policy of comparing livestock animals to people treated as sheep is not understood.
2516	12	Its attitude not only violates the importance of the Holocaust, but also damages the ecological movement. and Poland as well. He is a representative of our country. Such statements seem to join the orchestra of Putin playing on the node of Polish anti-Semitism.
25160	1	The fourth wave of heat in France. Temperatures will reach 40 degrees C.
25160	3	In many cities in France, the temperature will exceed 35 degrees Celsius from Monday and will reach 40 degrees Celsius in the next few days. The fourth heat wave, according to meteorologists, will last longer than the previous; it will last at least until 15 August.
25160	5	Due to the forecast forecasts in the various departments of France, weather alerts will be announced, which are already in force in Gard and Vaucluse.
25160	7	In Bordeaux, in the southwest of the country, the temperature will reach 35 degrees on Monday, and between Tuesday and Friday it will reach 37 degrees, according to Meteo-France. Local temperatures in these areas will reach up to 40 degrees. The night will also be very hot; in Bordeaux from Tuesday to Friday evening the temperature is expected to be 25-26 degrees Celsius.
25160	9	The appearance of the fourth wave of heat is interpreted by the weather conditions observed above the European continent. A powerful anticyclone associated with the dry and burning weather is now located above the British Islands, and through Portugal the hot air stream from the Sahara reaches France, experts say.
25160	11	The fourth wave of heat deepens the country’s dry and fire threat for several weeks, the meteorological services warn. The top of the previous high temperature wave took place in France on August 3.
25161	1	Our Way by Antoni Macierewicz. It costs $500 more per day than other members.
25161	3	Antoni Macierewicz, as one of the few series members, enjoys the privileges worthy of the minister. It is fully protected by the state. Although specific data is unknown, it may, according to professionals, cost up to $600 a day. 
25161	5	Mariusz Błaszczak, who 4,5 years ago replaced Antonio Macierevich as defense minister. One of the first decisions he made was to establish for his predecessor the protection of the Military Gendarmery. He made a special decision. 
25161	7	"The opposition, though according to the reports of the ""Fact"", tried to find out how this protection generates costs, refused from the wall. The Ministry of Internal Affairs applies to the law on the protection of disclosed information and the security of persons protected. However, he pointed out that protection is within the scope of the military gendarmery’s duties, therefore “there is no risk to the state’s treasures for additional expenses.” Officials performing the service could perform other duties during the time of the protection of the ""usual"" deputy, so as Monika Rosa of Modern arguments, ""it is a serious treatment of citizens and budgetary funds, because everyone is paying for it."""
25161	9	Antoni Macierewicz is still silent on this issue. 
25161	11	According to Jerzy Devulski, the cost of such protection should be estimated at a few hundred zlotys per day (about 500 - 600 zlotys). This is a basic protection consisting of two persons. Not counted in. used car. 
25163	1	Sunday: The infection of the monkey is not high
25163	3	When it comes to action against the monkey ospa, we first and foremost see that the transmission mechanisms are not so sensitive, and the infection is not large, said on Monday in an interview with the Ministry of Health Adam Niedzielski.
25163	5	The minister, asked by the Interia about the actions that were taken in connection with the monkeys, replied that the Polish services worked perfectly.
25163	7	“A visit to a doctor, a preliminary diagnosis of a possible infection with a monkey cough, immediate isolation, rapid epidemiological interview, conversation with people from the circle exposed to infection, their supervision, and, in the meantime, the transmission of genetic material to the NIZP-PZH and the examination – all worked as appropriate,” he explained. He added that the patient feels well, and people around him don’t have any symptoms of this disease.
25163	9	The head of the health department said there are other suspects of infection, but everyone is waiting in the hospital in isolation for the results of the study. The persons who have been in contact with them are identified by the sanitary inspection.
25163	11	“There’s nothing to worry, though there’s probably more cases in Poland. However, I recommend peace and distance to any pessimistic vision,” said Sunday.
25163	13	He estimated that over the past two years work has been carried out aiming at improving both the operation of the hospital and the sanitary inspection. In addition, as he explained, Poland is prepared for the equipment needed to treat a large number of people.

25163	17	The serpent is a rare, reflecting viral disease. It is usually found in Western and Central Africa. The symptoms include fever, headache and skin outbreak, which starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Infections with the monkey ospa virus have been recorded recently. in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, the UK, Austria and Sweden. 
25164	1	The party Together asks the government about the atom. “There is no real will”
25164	3	The Party Together filed an interpellation to the Prime Minister on the nuclear project. It contains questions on key issues related to the implementation of this project.
25164	5	A group of politicians of the party Together in the composition of Maciej Konjeczny, Magdalena Biejat, Daria Gosek-Popiołek, Paulina Matysiak, Adrian Zandberg, Marcelina Zawisza sent to the prime minister an interpellation on the Polish nuclear project. The Polish Nuclear Energy Program is one of the largest infrastructure projects in Poland, necessary to carry out energy transformation and leaving fossil fuels. Its efficient implementation, along with the development of renewable energy sources, is necessary for the Poles and Poles to provide cheap electricity and to reduce Poland’s dependence on the import of energy carriers. At the same time, despite its unalternativity, it seems that there is no real will to implement it. It can be questioned whether it is conducted in a thoughtful and planned manner at all,” the parliamentarians write.
25164	7	“It is possible to observe an alarming chaos within the Council of Ministers, the lack of cooperation between the Ministry of Climate and the Environment and the government official on strategic energy infrastructure and the underlying company Polskie Elektrovne Nukrowe sp. “As well as attempts to launch by the Ministry of State Assets a competitive reactor construction plan with regard to the Polish Nuclear Energy Program, based on unbuilt structures anywhere in the world,” they add.
25164	9	Parliamentarians raise in question a number of questions about the implementation of the nuclear project. “Why was not a competitive process of selection of the supplier of nuclear blocks in the form of e.g. the demand of the supplier with specific conditions, only instead it was seen as unbinding and in the absence of guidelines, incomparable offers from the suppliers? What are the risks of the European Commission’s approval for public aid? Why the environmental impact report, submitted to the General Directorate of Environmental Protection, and developed by the company Polskie Elektrrowe sp. from O.O. for the location Lubiatovo-Kopalino and Žarnoviec is based exclusively on the Westinghouse AP1000 technology, although the supplier has not yet been selected?” - this is just some of the total 14 issues that have been moved by the Party Together.
25165	1	The Different Frontiers of One War
25165	3	Another Russian crime in Ukraine is accompanied by actions aimed at provoking a deep economic crisis in Europe. Russia is hoping that this will be a way to win the war.
25165	6	The situation on the Russian-Ukrainian front in recent days is the easiest to summarize with the statement: “There are no big changes.” Russia is still unable to control the entire Donbass, although it continues to attack. Ukraine begins forced evacuation of the population of a part of the Donetsk district and simultaneously sends signs of preparation for the counter-defence toward Cherson, although it still lacks more western weapons.
25165	8	At the same time, Russian attacks on civilian objects have become everyday, and a particular routine of the crimes committed by the Russians makes many Western media inform only of the most horrible. One of the latest examples was an attack on a bark for Ukrainian prisoners in Olenivka, resulting in at least 40 of them killed and 130 were injured. The Russian propaganda immediately stated that the explosion was caused by the Ukrainian side.
25165	10	The Kremlin has a long tradition of murdering prisoners, and this time it may have been about hiding the bestial torture over them. In recent days, recordings have come to the network showing how the Russians barbarily treat Ukrainian prisoners taken to prison. In the Ukrainian society, this causes not as much defetism as Moscow would, which increases the will of resistance and strengthens the belief that it is a war for physical survival.
25165	12	On this background, a positive signal could be the conclusion of the agreement on July 22 to unlock three Ukrainian ports over the Black Sea, which is intended to allow the renewal of the exports of Ukrainian grain. The document was able to be negotiated with the United Nations, and its acouser became Turkey. The first transportation departed from Odessa on August 1, but the key is the question of the durability of the agreement and its compliance by Russia. The blockade of food exports from Ukraine was intended in the Kremlin calculations not only to deepen the problems of the Ukrainian economy, but also to trigger a food crisis in the countries of the global South, whose consequences would hit the West. Therefore, it would seem that Russia is not interested in removing blocks from Ukrainian ports. Unless the price for this will be the real pollution of some Western sanctions. There is no doubt that Moscow can at any time restore the blockade, accusing Kiev of intended provocations. In the absurdity of lies, the Kremlin is still battling its own records.
25165	14	As of now, Russia has focused on the energy front, reducing the supply of the Nord Stream 1 by 80 percent. Even the strongest believers in the rationality of Russia as a supplier of raw materials have dismissed the illusions – the Kremlin is aiming to boost energy prices to heavenly sizes to deepen the economic problems of the European Union. If anyone has not yet looked at it, Moscow still reminds us that it has declared us an energy war to destroy. The Russian bills are simple – a wealthy and comfortable Europe, facing the prospect of a cold winter, the need to exclude part of the industry, high inflation and mass dissatisfaction of the voters, will proceed “pragmatically”, i.e. remove part of the sanctions and force Kiev to withdraw.
25165	16	Moscow is not here completely without a chance, since even the head of Ukrainian diplomacy Dmitry Kuleba had to publicly note: “Under the pretext of the need to improve the [gas] situation before the winter, some of our Western partners are trying to negotiate with Russia. We will calmly explain to them why their hopes for the constructive position of Russia are incompatible with reality.”
25165	18	However, it is more likely that the Kremlin will a reverse effect – Europe will survive the winter without Russian gas, which will force it to accelerate (although extremely expensive) derusification of its energy sectors. In a war on many fronts, the winner is the one who keeps more consequences and resistance. Whoever fails first will lose.
25166	1	Interview with Kashmir. “Our enemies wanted primitive Poland, and that’s what Tusk builds.”
25166	3	"Donald Tusk is implementing a ""foreign order"", that is, it supports German politics, says Jarosław Kaczyński in a recent interview with the ""Site"" weekly magazine. The PiS leader also assessed that the PO chairman decided to “extreme brutalization of public life.”"
25166	5	"Already in his first speeches he talked about the division of good and evil, he claimed that it was enough to hit stronger and encouraged to do so. Now he decides to the already extreme brutalization and animation of public life,"" Jarosław Kaczyński said in a conversation with Mikhail Karnowski. I write it into a tradition. Our enemies always wanted Poland a primitive, vulgar and rejecting culture. This is what Tusk builds on a foreign order, he said."
25166	7	"Kaczynski then assessed that ""foreign order"" is the implementation of German policy. He added that in his assessment our Western neighbors want “domination over the whole of Europe.”"
25166	9	"Michael Karnowski asked about the question of the introduction of the euro in Poland. Karnowski said that this could lead to the ""acceptance"" of the National Bank of Poland. He added to a recent interview on the networks with NBP President Adam Glapiński, who, in turn, talked about “the crazy attacks on the institution he directs.”"
25166	11	In order to introduce the euro, it is necessary to change the constitution, which they have no chance to do. That’s why they would want to this by the Constitutional Court, they were, who would decide, what the currency in Poland is clearly recorded there, and does not mean what it means. Such votes have already appeared, the politician said in response.
25166	13	Kaczynski about Donald Tusk
25166	15	"In an interview with Jaroslav Kaczynski, Donald Tusk's wing appears also during the discussion of the defence and development of the Polish army. PiS President said that Donald Tusk only ""washed the Polish army"" and he himself entered the government to ""implement a radical plan to strengthen Polish defence."""
25168	1	Kim Jong Un wants to support Putin’s army. This is what equipment Korea has.
25168	3	North Korea can help Russia by sending its troops to Donbass. In the framework of the proposal submitted to Putin by Kim Jong-un, the pro-Kremlin self-government republics in Ukraine should reach up to 100,000. The Soldiers. It would be a serious support for Putin, whose army has increasingly problems with the recruitment of volunteers. Let’s see what capabilities and equipment the Korean Army has.
25168	5	According to media reports, Kim Jong-un has submitted a proposal to Putin, in the framework of which full Korea. Send to the so-called The Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic not only their employees, but also up to 100 thousand. The Soldiers. It is a serious force that can theoretically be a serious problem for the Ukrainian army fighting in the east of its country. In exchange for the transfer of its units to Donbass. It is expected to receive grain and energy from Russia.
25168	7	However, Russia may depend not only on human forces, but also on the artillery systems owned by the Koreans from the north. For years, Pyongyang has invested huge funds in its missile batteries and tanks, including hypersonic structures, using them to intimidate its neighbors and provoke the United States. He does this unfortunately at the expense of his inhabitants, neglecting other industries than military.
25168	9	If the Russians receive support from North Korea, then unfortunately the Ukrainians may have serious problems with the potential reflection of self-reliance pro-Kremlin republics. It is unclear whether North Korean soldiers would be able to take an active part in the offensive operations and occupation of the territory of Ukraine, or whether they may be limited to shooters using their artillery.
25168	11	And the North Korean artillery itself is really powerful, which you will be convinced by looking at the list of weapons that North Korea currently has.

25169	3	Small opposition parties will be driven by Donald Tusk's actions. Fake news and fake news. The presence of mercury.
25169	5	This is by the portal wprost.pl. “Small opposition parties are angry at Donald Tusk that he has broken into a narrative about an elevated level of mercury in Odra, even if it was already known that research has not confirmed it,” we read on the page.

25169	9	"“Healthy voters may not like it,” the opposition spokesman said. According to him, Tusk is working in the mind of a strategy once formulated by Thomas Lis, saying that ""everyone has his own facts."""
25169	12	“The Iron voter of PiS believes that the Germans have contaminated Odra. And the hard sympathy of the Civil Platform believes in mercury, even if research does not confirm it. Only that the iron electors themselves do not win the elections – we read.

25169	16	"Chairman of the Civil Platform Donald Tusk, criticizing the rulers, wrote on social media that ""not only fish in Odra are shrinked, the whole state is shrinked under the Kaczynski rule"", and ""PiS is like a mercury.""

2517	6	I am glad that it depends so much on our votes, because thanks to this I am able to introduce laws that I would never be able to introduce myself in my life,” Kukiz said, noting that the ruling majority, among other things. The vote on the budget depends on the votes of the members of the Kukiz'15.
2517	8	In return, I received an anti-corruption law, which has already been signed by the president. Amendments to the WS Regulation. the norek.

2517	10	We got direct sales to farmers, the judges of the peace are already under the ceremonies of the Sejm, he added.
2517	12	I’m not threatening – so Kukiz answered the question why in that case, if the cooperation with PiS is so well arranged to him, he threatens the ruling party that he won’t vote with her if the Deputy Minister of Sport will remain Lukas Mejza. This is not a threat, it is not a threat, it is not a threat, it is not a threat, it is not a threat, it is not a threat. I talked with President Jaroslav Kaczynski and at some point I said that the President should not deal with that issue that I will immediately move, in political, but in ethical, moral terms. There is no such option to indirectly vote for a government in which a person with low transparency is sitting. It’s not going to get rid of it and that’s all, he added.
2517	14	It does not satisfy me that Lukas Mejza was suspended – Kukiz stressed adding that Mejza de facto went on vacation. You can’t hide, you can hide.

25170	1	"Tusk grims about the ""dirty state"": PiS is like a mercury"
25170	3	“There are not only fish in Odra, the whole state is slaughtered under the Kaczynski rule. It’s like a mercury,” Donald Tusk wrote on Twitter.
25170	5	"The environmental catastrophe in Odra Tusk also referred to on Thursday, during a meeting with the inhabitants of Jaktorova in Mazowsz. The situation related to the deaths of fish and other animals in Odra is ""one of the biggest ecological scandals of recent years."""
25170	7	"As Donald Tusk added in Jaktorov, since July 26, when the first signals appeared in the case, the rulers ""to date de facto have not sent information to people that the water is poisoned."" “We are all a bit like those fish in Odrze,” he added."
25170	9	“Territorials will help”
25170	11	The head of the PO also reminded that the information on this matter appeared in the Lower Silesia already at the end of July. On July 26, it was already known that Odra is in danger of an environmental disaster, already at that time hundreds of kilograms of drowned fish flowed through Odra. On the 3th of August, a parliamentary interpellation, one of the leaders of the Green Party, from our coalition, filed an interpellation, (...). Today we find out that Mr. Błaszczak sends soldiers there, when Odra is actually poisoned throughout the course, he said.
25170	13	On Thursday, National Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak announced on Twitter that the soldiers will be directed to the Odra region. “Territorials and operational troops will help remove pollution on the river,” Błaszczak wrote. “They will also be ready to carry out other tasks,” he added.
25170	15	"On Thursday afternoon, the rbb24 portal that laboratory staff in Berlin-Brandenburg found high concentrations of mercury in water samples. The flood of fish in Odrze on the section from Oławy down has been observed since mid-July. The fishing fish was also observed. in the vicinity of Wroclaw. Wojewódzki Inspectorat of Environmental Protection in Wrocław also on Thursday that in any of the samples taken from Odra in the province of Dolnośląski after 1 August was not found the presence of mezitylene and that ""in all the samples studied starting from 28 July microscopic biological analysis showed the presence of typical organisms for the river Odra."""
25172	1	Moravia is unpleasant. “Oda is as contaminated with mercury as Tusk is truthful.”
25172	3	Matthew Morawiecki did not leave a dry niche on Donald Tusk. This time there was an ecological disaster. The Prime Minister, not wrapping in words, compared the river contamination to... the truthfulness of the PO leader.
25172	5	The whole country is in a dramatic situation. So far, firefighters and fishermen have caught more than 100 tons of drowned fish from the river. An alarming signal was observed for the first time in late July in Oław pod Wrocław, and in mid-August contaminated water arrived in Szczecin. Experts are talking about a huge ecological catastrophe, after which the ecosystem will decline for years.
25172	7	The authorities have been trying for many days to determine what has caused the mass extinction of fish. Initially, studies showed an increased oxygen level and high absorption, and later the media revealed sensational reports of mercury Odry contamination. The presence of this element was intended to prove the studies conducted by the Germans, but later it was found that it was a translation error, and the German services were talking about a high pH in water.
25172	9	Moravecki without compassion for Tusk
25172	11	"Before this information was cleared, the news of the alleged mercury in the Polish river was caught by the press, and the Polish authorities were scattered. For the lack of rapid action on water pollution, the government pointed out, among others. by Donald Tusk. ""There are not only fish in Odra drowned, the whole state is drowned under Kaczynski's rule"" and ""Pis is like a mercury,"" he wrote on Twitter."
25172	13	For the words of the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister has been dismissed. The Friday Conference in Smolayna (Woj. Matthew Morawiecki reminded in a boring and unclear way that “some insinuated some contamination of Odra with chemicals, contamination of Odra with mercury.”
25172	15	So I wanted to say that Odra is as contaminated with chemicals, as contaminated with mercury as Donald Tusk is contaminated with truthfulness, i.e. at all.
25172	17	The latest research has allowed the Prime Minister to issue such a strong judgment on the river. On the same day, the climate minister Anna Moscow said that water controls did not show any illegal activity in the river. The government is now guilty of the disaster in unidentified algae and high water supply, which could be contributed to the waste of water from the mines.
25174	1	Russians without permission for work and residence. “It is about the security of the country.”
25174	3	Remember: we informed about the rejection to the citizens of Russia at the beginning of August. Now we know more details.
25174	5	According to the information provided by the Navy of Gdańsk, since February 24 (i.e. from the day the Russian armies illegally attacked Ukraine) 78 negative decisions have been made for Russian citizens who were seeking temporary residence or work.
25174	7	A total of 548 such applications were submitted from February to June 30. However, it is not known what their status is currently.
25174	9	It is not excluded that they are still being analyzed by officials. However, the scale of refusal may be even greater. This is the legal basis that was founded in the negative decisions already made.
25174	11	As we were able to find out, art was shown. 100 mouths. 1 paragraph 4 of the Law of 12 December 2013 on Foreigners. In accordance with this provision:
25174	13	“The landlord is refused to be granted permission for temporary residence if it is required for the reasons of defence or security of the state or the protection of security and public order or the obligation arising from the provisions of ratified international agreements applicable to the Polish Republic.”
25174	15	Hundreds of Russians Working in the Sea
25174	17	In this place it is worth noting that the citizens of Russia are one of the largest groups of foreigners employed in the Navy.
25174	19	According to the latest ZUS data, among the social insurance applicants in the branches in Gdańsk and Słupsk, foreigners are dominated by Ukrainians. By the end of March there were more than 42.5 thousand. This is an increase of more than 2.5 thousand. compared to December 2021.
25174	21	The second group is about 5,000. Citizens of Belarus (a growth of 500 people).
25174	23	The first five were closed by passengers: Georgia (1524), Russia (1203) and Moldova (1072).
25174	25	Europe is increasingly closed to Russia
25174	27	However, we have informally heard that the decision to refuse Russian workers to work and stay is related to the recommendations of the Internal Security Agency.
25174	29	However, the actions of the Polish services should not be surprised, especially in the context of much more prudent and official statements of the border countries with Russia.
25174	31	The U.S. agency Associated Press in recent days the proposals of the leaders of Estonia and Finland. The authorities of these countries demand the cessation of the issuance of tourist visas to Russians.
25174	33	The citizens of this country should not have the opportunity to spend their holidays in Europe, while the Russian government is fighting the war in Ukraine.
25174	35	The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for According to the report, 3668 civilians were killed in Ukraine from February 24 to May 15. 3,896 people were injured. There are also evidence of war crimes committed by Russian soldiers.
25174	37	In turn, the Russian news agency TASS that according to a survey conducted on May 10-15 on the test 1,600. Russian citizens trust Vladimir Putin is 81 percent. However, it should be noted that the credibility of the pro-Kremlin survey and agency is relatively small.
25175	1	The Owsiak responds to Dudze's words about the border. “The wheels fall from your mouth.”
25175	3	Jurek Owsiak in his social media decided to refer to the words of Andrei Dudy, which the president spoke during a speech on the occasion of the Holy Day of the Polish Army. “God’s words that such behavior is stupidity and betrayal, are the next breeds that fall from the mouths of the Lord,” the head of the WHO said.
25175	5	Andrzej Duda during his speech on the occasion of the Holy Day of the Polish Army. on the Polish-Belarusian border. 
25175	7	"First of all, the president thanked the soldiers who defend the border against migrants. ""Thanks to the position of the Polish soldiers and officials, thanks to your position, we showed this determination to the whole world, defending the Polish border, defending the borders of the European Union, defending the borders of the Schengen zone,"" Duda said. “Through different types of attacks, different dwarfs and traitors, different people irresponsible, the Polish soldier stood at the height of the task, he resisted,” he added."
25175	9	Help for Migrants
25175	11	Andrzej Dudy’s words were obviously harassed by Jurka Owsiaka, who decided to refer to them on his Facebook profile. “Mr President. You once again gave a signal from the planet on which you live – but it’s far from Poland and the Poles, who have their simple clear and citizen code of conduct!” He started. 
25175	13	"Owsiak recalled that for more than three years his foundation has been teaching ""small children and young people the principles of giving first aid - three million people have completed our courses by the exam they submitted."" “The basic principle of our courses is the principle of a good Samaritan who teaches us to provide assistance to the person in need, and the same principle may bring legal consequences to us who do not provide such assistance,” he continued. "
25175	15	He mentioned that volunteers opened a humanitarian point in Mikhailov near the Polish-Belarusian border. “We’ve seen how many people of good will help people exhausted and exhausted. Not everyone has survived these terrible days for them, and by today the people on this piece of earth suffer,” Owsiak wrote. 
25175	17	Eggs to Dudy: the next breeds that fall from your mouth
25175	19	The head of the WHO later did not hide that Dudy's words annoyed him. He accused the president of saying that his words were “bad.”
25175	21	Jurek Owsiak also said that the help he and his foundation will not end. “Nadal, when it is necessary, we will help, and we do it according to the principle of the good Samaritan, and the thoughts and actions of the Lord, which I often shame, will never stop me and my friends, our friends, from fair and humanitarian actions above all religions and colors.” 
25175	23	“With tremendous optimism in my heart I read a lot of comments on your words, which, like me, disagree with them and show us, Poles, as people who will always in extreme situations be bringing help to their neighbors!” The Owsiak ended. 
25177	1	Elections in Italy: Leader of the extreme right Georgia Meloni on the wave of support
25177	3	Italian politician Georgia Meloni flows on the wave of support, thanks to which she can become the first female prime minister in the country and the first extreme right-wing leader since World War II.
25177	5	Although her Italian Brothers party has neo-fascist roots and promotes the message of Christianity, patriotism, maternity and traditional family values, Meloni tries to dissolve the fears related to her inheritance, saying that voters are tired of such discussions.
25177	7	However, there are still signs that such a shell cannot be so easily destroyed: in the symbol of its party is a picture of a three-colored flame, borrowed from the neo-Fascist party formed shortly after the end of the war.
25177	9	If the Italian Brothers win the elections on 25 September, and the 45-year-old Meloni becomes the prime minister, it will take almost 100 years after the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini came to power in October 1922.
25177	11	Meloni proudly presented Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, the lawyer of the dictatorship, as one of his candidates for the European Parliament in 2019, although he eventually lost.
25177	13	For most Italian voters, questions about anti-fascism and neo-fascism are not “the key engine to vote,” said Lorenzo Pregliasco, head of the survey company YouTrend. “They don’t see it as a part of the present. They see it as a part of the past.”
25177	15	Read more about: defeat victory of extreme right in French elections
25177	17	Nevertheless, Meloni is sensitive to international analyses about her possible premiere and wants to define conservative rather than extreme right to describe her party.
25177	19	"She recently recorded video news in English, French and Spanish, in which it was stated that the Italian right ""for decades has transmitted fascism to history, clearly condemning the oppression of democracy and the shameful anti-Jewish laws."""
25177	21	It was a reference to the laws of 1938 that prohibited a small Italian Jewish community from engaging in business, education and other aspects of everyday life. The regulations shut the way to deport many Italian Jews to Nazi disappearance camps during the German occupation of Rome at the end of World War II.
25177	23	However, keeping a three-colored flame in the logo of his party, he “symbolically enjoys this heritage,” said David Art, a professor of political science at Tufts University, who explores the extreme right of Europe. “But then he wants to say ‘we’. You are not a racist.”
25177	25	Who is Giorgia Meloni?
25177	27	She apologized for the “ton,” but not for the content of the scary speech she spoke in June in Spain to gain support for the extreme right-wing Vox party.
25177	29	“They will say that we are dangerous, extremists, racists, fascists, deniers and homofobists,” Meloni said, obviously referring to the deniers of the Holocaust. She ended a crescendo of screaming passwords: “Yes for natural families! Not for the LGBT lobby. for sexual identity. Not for gender ideology!”
25177	31	Meloni arrested “the bureaucrates in Brussels” and “climate fundamentalism.” Meloni, who has a young daughter, said that “the most censored” return is “woman and maternity.”
25177	33	Abortion has not appeared as a topic of a campaign in Italy, where it is legal. But Meloni condemned the declining birth rate in Italy, which would be even lower if not immigrants were giving birth to children.
25177	35	At the eve of the right-wing supporters in Rome in 2019 Meloni raised a ring of approval, screaming in a staccato rate: “I’m Giorgia! I am a woman. I am a mother. I am a Christian and I am a Christian. You can’t take it from me!”
25177	37	In a few days, her proclamation became a food for the texts of the rap song. While some perceived it as a parody, Meloni loved it, and even sang a few tactus in the state radio show.
25177	39	According to her memories “I am Giorgia” of 2021, a significant part of her identity was shaped by growing up in the working district of Garbatella in Rome.
25177	41	At the age of 15, she joined the youth division of the Italian Social Movement, a neo-Fascist party with the symbol of the flame and covered with political posters in the capital.
25177	43	When she was 31 years old, Berlusconi appointed her as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The youth in his third and last government. She was the co-founder of Brothers of Italy in 2012.
25177	45	Both Salvini and Meloni claim to protect what they call the Christian identity of Europe. Salvini kisses whispering roses and wears a big cross on her often shed breasts, while Meloni's small cross sometimes stands out above her loose blues.
25177	47	Her party strongly supported Draghi's move to send weapons to Ukraine, although Salvini and Berlusconi, the open fans of Russian President Vladimir Putin, gave only a cool support. Meloni also defends the NATO alliance established by the United States, a country belonging to the Seven Group. However, it often sees the EU rules as a violation of Italy’s sovereignty.
25177	49	If Meloni’s extreme right-wing forces dominate the next Italian government, there is fear of the support that Italy will give to the right-wing governments in Hungary and Poland “for their deeply conservative programs” among the fears of a “democratic deviation” in the EU, Art said. .
25177	51	Meloni said he would “do not stand against any anti-democratic threat.”
25177	53	What is the creation of the Italian Brothers Party?
25177	55	Even five years ago, the Brothers of Italy – a name inspired by the original words of the national hymn – were seen as a marginal force, gaining 4.4% of the votes. Currently, surveys indicate that in September it could take the first place and gain up to 24% support, just before the Central-Levic Democratic Party led by former Prime Minister Enrico Letta.
25177	57	In a complex, partially proportional electoral system in Italy, electoral coalitions are what makes the party leaders get to the prime minister, and not just the votes. Right-wing politicians have done much better work this year than Democrats, building widespread electoral partnerships.
25177	59	Meloni allied with the right-wing League party led by Matteo Salvini, who, like her, promotes the dealing with illegal migration. Its second electoral ally is the center-right Forza Italia party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
25177	61	Last year, her party was the only one to refuse to join the Italian national coalition of pandemic unity led by Prime Minister Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank. Draghi’s government collapsed last month, suddenly abandoned by Salvin, Berlusconi and the 5-star leader Giuseppe Conte, who are busy with the falling fortunes of their party in polls and local elections.
25177	63	Meloni’s opinion studies “prove a consistent and coherent approach to politics. It hasn’t come to a compromise,” said Lorenzo Pregliasco from YouTrend, adding that he’s also seen as “a leader who has clear ideas – of course not everyone agrees with them.”
25178	1	As a shameful billionaire intends to “happy everyone.” Silvio Berlusconi Returns to Political Halls
25178	3	The 85-year-old former Italian Prime Minister has a chance to become the main player in the upcoming elections. This could lead to another five years of political influence. The career of Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire, a real estate market potent, a media magnate and a three-time Italian prime minister, has been on decades, but recently his popularity has been significantly weakened.
25178	5	Berlusconi is sick. Nevertheless, he does not let him forget. At party parties it appears rather through a video link. In addition, after being sentenced for tax fraud, he was sentenced to a four-year ban on public functions in Italy.
25178	7	But now, when he is 85 years old, and most people in his age rather already rely on the sofa, the former Italian prime minister decided to run in the elections. “This is how everyone will be happy,” he told the radio with his unmistakable certainty.
25178	9	If no miracle happens, the election of September 25 will bring the triumph of the right-wing coalition, in which Berlusconi will be the leading player, which will provide him with influence for the next five years.
25178	11	"The return is the result of his feeling of ""obligation,"" said POLITICO in written answers to our questions. Italy needs values that only its party represents to improve the economy, he said. “My parents taught me that when I feel a strong sense of duty, I have to find the courage to do it.”"
25178	13	The Rise
25178	15	Although he has dominated Italian politics and the media for more than two decades, even recently it seemed that Berlusconi’s political career was already behind him.
25178	17	His image is so called. Affer bunga bunga, in which witnesses described the orgie in his displayed villa under Milan. In 2011, the growing national debt crisis and the fears that Italy may not fulfill its obligations forced him to transfer power to the technocrat Mario Monti. He had to face numerous accusations until he was eventually removed from the senate after sentenced for tax fraud in 2013.
25178	19	However, the unexpected outbreak of nationalist populism in the last decade has given Berlusconi a chance to turn himself into the role of a responsible, pro-union, moderate politician. He was elected to the European Parliament in 2019, but he rarely participates in voting.
25178	21	Last year, his rehabilitation seemed complete when he joined a large coalition led by the former President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, the edge of European institutions.
25178	23	"Last month, apparently feeling a change in political winds, he joined other coalition partners, withdrawing support for the government of Draghi, which forced the conduct of accelerated elections that the right has a chance to win. Three ministers of his government resigned from membership in the Forza Italia party, claiming that it is ""unresponsible"" and presents party interests over the good of the country."
25178	25	"Berlusconi refuses any responsibility for the fall of the government, claiming that ""we would like the government of Draghi to last until the natural end of its mandate with the elections in 2023. There was no other solution than asking the citizens.”"
25178	27	A weak partner, but not so weak
25178	29	The support for Berlusconi, a minor partner in the right-wing alliance with the hard-right Italian Brothers Giorgio Meloni and the anti-immigration League of Matteo Salvini, is much lower than in the glory times in 2008, when his party gained 37 percent. in elections. Currently, its records are around 8%. However, the total right-wing parties are expected to get about 45 percent. The vote is sufficient to get a majority in the parliament.
25178	31	However, the right must convince not only Italian voters, but also international investors, rating agencies, European governments and institutions who fear that the most right-wing government in the postwar history of Italy could be a threat to the democracy and allies of Italy in the Union and NATO.
25178	33	If international institutions are not convinced that strongly debt Italy will be in safe hands, the loans costs will rapidly rise, and the field of government maneuver will be seriously limited.
25178	35	Return to Putin
25178	37	One of the reasons for these concerns was the warm relations of some members of the alliance with extreme-right parties in other countries, such as the Spanish Vox, as well as with autocrats, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán or Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
25178	39	The League signed a cooperation agreement with the Putin party in 2017 and Salvini tried to carry out a peace mission in Moscow at the beginning of this year, but it was revealed that it was paid by the Russian embassy. Berlusconi himself Putin's long friendship and even spent his holidays in his daches, and now he was forced to deny the media reports that he contacted the Russian ambassador in Rome and sympathized with the position of Russia.
25178	41	"So far, his criticism of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has been stunned. But in a statement to POLITICO Berlusconi clearly condemned his former friend: ""Today Russia, attacking Ukraine, violated international law and brought a painful war into the heart of Europe."""
25178	43	"Speaking of the times when he was Prime Minister, Berlusconi says he was only working on improving relations between Russia and the West. The 2002 NATO-Russia Agreement in Rome ""may have been the beginning of an era in which Russia has become a partner and a trusted interlocutor."" He said he was “deep disappointed” by Putin."
25178	45	"Berlusconi denied that any party in the right-wing alliance has an extremist character, claiming that the coalition is a central-right and added that ""this has nothing to do with extremist movements in other countries."""
25178	47	“We are pro-European, pro-Western, pronounced, with liberal democracy as our only reference point,” Berlusconi wrote, adding that “he would not participate in any government” if he was not absolutely sure of its “democratic correctness, the sense of responsibility and loyalty to Europe and the West.”
25178	49	According to Berlusconi, the loyalty of the central-left is doubtful because the coalition is part of the extreme-left party that voted against Sweden and Finland’s membership in the NATO.
25178	51	The Second Life of Berlusconi
25178	53	Despite the lowest popularity today, Berlusconi is still able to cause confusion. Last week, during the discussion of the proposed reform of the presidential system, he suggested that President Sergio Mattarella, if this reform passes, will have to resign.
25178	55	This statement was taken as an attack on Mattarella, the guarantor of Italian democratic balance and the most popular policy in the country. The opponents of Berlusconi accused the right man of a record aimed at dismantling the Italian democratic system and said that Berlusconi wanted that role for himself. Berlusconi refused to be president.
25178	57	Berlusconi could aspire to the second highest position in Italy – the chairman of the Senate, but it would be a very controversial choice, and his allies have not so far supported him.
25178	59	Secret people say the election campaign has revived him. His campaign, based on videos posted on Facebook, uses nostalgia for the 1990s and proven promises of tax cuts and retirement increases.
25178	61	Even without a formal position, as long as he gathers the votes expected, Berlusconi will have significant influences in the next government.
25178	63	If you get 7 to 8 percent. Votes, as we expect, can mean a difference between a clear right-wing victory and an unresolved result,” said Daniele Albertazzi, a professor of politics at the University of Surrey. It would be crucial for the coalition. And you can think that will make it feel to your allies.
25178	65	Ideologically, there is a broad agreement between the right-wing alliance on the electoral program of tax cuts and immigration restrictions, and the extreme right-wing parties look unlikely to deal with their more extremist supporters.
25178	67	However, Berlusconi can, if he wishes, designate a lot of red lines. The position of Forza Italia in the center means that it is the only party that can theoretically move to support a leftist or technocratic government, without paying a high price to the voters.
25178	69	He is necessary. There can be a lot of games in the center,” Albertazi said. It may remain important for the next five years.
25179	1	“Teflon Marek” is the longest prime minister in the history of the Netherlands. Who is Mark Rutte?
25179	3	He had to stop in front of the extreme right under the figure of the dangerous Geert Wilders. And he did that. Unfortunately, he took part in the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the opponent. During his term, all attempts to reform the EU were blocked by the Netherlands.
25179	5	The financial crisis, the refugee crisis, the pandemic crisis and finally the crisis caused by the war in Ukraine – with many challenges the Netherlands have faced over the past 12 years, but every time with the same person at the forefront. Rutte's political longevity is something unique in Western Europe, but dark clouds are gathering over the head of the government in Hague and it is unknown if this time he will be able to disperse them.
25179	7	It is the year 2010. Barack Obama has only recently been the president, France is governed by Nicholas Sarkozy, Italy is the prime minister of Silvio Berlusconi, and Poland is the first term of Donald Tusk's government. In the Netherlands – then called the Netherlands – the elections were won by the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), and the head of the government was its chairman Mark Rutte.
25179	9	At the beginning of August, exactly 4,310 days have passed since Rutte's conviction, making him a record in the length of his office as Prime Minister. He belonged to the Chadeque of Ruuda Lubbers, who ruled the country between 1982 and 1994. Rutte as Prime Minister survived three national elections, more than a hundred parliamentary attempts to withdraw him from office and several political crises. All this led the Dutch to give him the “teflon Mark” assumption – no dirty to him does. Among the leaders of the European Union, only Viktor Orban accompanied him at the beginning of his first term. Hungary with authoritarian tendons is nonewhere, and what about Rutt?
25179	11	Hot water and bicycle in the garage
25179	13	The head of the Dutch government does not borrow 12 years in the position of his charisma or the kidnapping of the Dutch ambitious visions. As he once said, parafrating Helmut Schmidt, if someone is looking for a vision, then he should go to the eye scientist, not to him. The VVD guide suggests peace, stability and warm water in the crane instead. And to the voters, this discouragement seems to speak. A lot has changed in the Dutch politics over the past few years, but not the person of the prime minister. It may not be taken away, but it seems to manage the state well.
25179	15	With the image of a modest manager, Rutte is famous for getting to work on a bicycle, has a old car and a small house. He also carefully adheres to the law: in the times when many politicians are overwhelmed by scandals related to the breakdown of covid blocks, Rutte did not visit the hospital of the dying mother because it would be incompatible with the current restrictions. Through its way very controversial and triggering sharp protests, so the hypocrisy of the rulers will not slam them. The Teflon Marek remained clean.
25179	17	However, it cannot be forgotten that the Dutch Prime Minister is also an extremely skillful politician, capable of lavirating between different political options and making difficult compromises. These skills are necessary in a country where the actual electoral threshold is 0.67%. There are usually ten or more parties in the parliament, and almost every government requires a coalition of at least a few of them. During Rutte's mandate, the VVD only once had more than 40 members in the 150 seats of the House of Representatives (Tweede Camera). In order to remain in power, the prime minister entered the most diverse coalitions, through which he was sometimes passed by a cameleon.
25179	19	Rutte’s Partners – From National Populists to Social Democrats
25179	21	The VVD leader has long been treated as a prisoner in front of the extreme right, so he rarely remembers that it with her help for the first time became a prime minister. In 2010, the Freedom Party of Geert Wilders granted support to Ruth and his Chadean coalitionists, which lasted until 2012, when pre-term elections came as a result of the lack of parliamentary majority for the policy of budget cuts. The next partner of VVD was the Social Democratic Labour Party (PvdA), so the government took a more central direction.
25179	23	In the next elections in 2017 Rutte has already appeared as a guarantor of stability and a pro-European liberal, whose goal is to stop the dangerous Wilders. And indeed he did that, but he himself accepted an anti-immigrant rhetoric, along with many demands of the extreme right. Let’s add that Rutte’s “pro-Europeanity” leads to the defence of his neoliberal and technocratic form, and during his term, all attempts to reform the Union were undermined by the Netherlands, which has recently become evident when the EU planned a rescue fund after a pandemic. Rutte was from the beginning one of the biggest supporters of the betting and also opposed too ambitious plans in EU budgets discussions.
25179	25	After the elections in 2017 and 2021, central-right government coalitions were formed consisting of the same parties: VVD, Social Liberal Democrats 66 and two Chadic groups (CDA and CU). In both cases, achieving an agreement was not easy, but Rutte proved its flexibility and the ability to build inter-party compromise. And despite the appearance of various candidates for the prime minister, no one was able to set up an alternative coalition.
25179	27	Fatigue, angry farmers, political rival – what will defeat Rutte?
25179	29	After twelve years in the position, it’s hard to keep the initial enthusiasm, and critics are increasingly pointing out to Rutte’s visible fatigue. He himself learns it, but if the rivals once compared him to the rabbit Duracella because of its energy and workforce, then now even the VVD activists informally mention the shooting of the prime minister and the need to find a successor. The circumstances do not save Rutte, because he recently had to deal with large protests against covid sharpnesses, and now, in turn, cities and roads are blocked by the tractors of angry farmers.
25179	31	Despite its small territory, the Netherlands is the largest meat exporter on the continent. However, the preservation of millions of livestock and other animals causes enormous environmental costs and due to pollution the government has announced a plan to reduce the living inventory by 50 percent. by 2030. This naturally irritated farmers and started their protests. It’s not the only pain of the Dutch – Rutte provided really warm water to the crane, but he did little to solve the country’s structural problems. For international corporations, the Netherlands is a tax paradise, but citizens have experienced a decrease in social benefits over the past few years. The housing crisis is ongoing and in the face of the state’s inactivity the local authorities are trying to fight it. Finally, there is a climate disaster, especially dangerous for the country, whose majority is depressed.
25179	33	In favour of Rutte, weakness of the opposition speaks. What is true in the wave of protests the support is gained by the Farmers-Civil Movement (BBB), but this is probably a temporary phenomenon. For this reason the Labour Party cannot withdraw from the time it joined the VVD coalition. We are talking about the possible association of the PvdA with the Green Left, but although according to the polls such a leftist coalition could fight even for election victory, it is still lacking specifics. The Socialist Party, on its turn, the last of the major progressive parties, is immersed in internal disputes between less and more radical activists, thus the electorate slowly escapes from it. On the other side of the political scene, on the extreme right, there is a competition between several parties and even the strongest of them can not now threaten VVD.
25179	35	There is also a chadec CDA in the crisis, but if you are looking for someone who would end Rutte's domination in politics, then he may be the former politician of that party, Peter Omtzigt. It led to the fall of the government shortly before the last elections, revealing that the Dutch treasury, very gentle to the corporations, unfairly deprived tens of thousands of parents of child benefits – many of them were also subjected to giant penalties for alleged fraud. Rutte survived this scandal, but it was one of the greatest hits he received in his political career. On the other hand, Omtzigt has quickly become one of the most popular politicians in the Netherlands, so it is speculated that it is he in the next elections that can release the teflon Mark of the next term, unless Rutte himself decides to retire in advance.
25180	1	"Discovered the ""weak point"" of the major variants of coronavirus"
25180	3	The researchers have discovered an important gap in all major variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the recently created Omikron subvariants. “Now, when we’ve been able to describe their structure in detail, a completely new treatment opportunity has opened to us,” the researchers say. In the publication they also explain why antibodies therapy for COVID-19 was not effective at key moments.
25180	5	The detected weakness could potentially use neutralizing antibodies, turning the path to therapies that would be effective against all the variants of coronavirus, researchers from the University of British Columbia emphasize.
25180	7	The team led by Dr. Srirama Subramaniama used the cryo-EM microscopy to reveal at the atomic level the structure of the sensitive place on the protein of the cortex of the virus. This fragment is called an epitope. At the same time, the scientists described the antibody VH Ab6, whose fragment is capable of joining the virus’s epithope and its total neutralization.
25180	10	The virus is adapting quickly.
25180	12	"""SARS-CoV-2 is a highly adaptative virus that in the process of evolution learned to avoid most existing antibodies therapy, as well as a large portion of the immunity provided by vaccines and natural infection,"" says Dr. Subramaniam. Our study reveals its weakness, which is largely unchanged in all variants and can be easily neutralized by an antibody fragment."
25180	14	“This is a good ground for the design of a variety of therapies and procedures that can potentially help many people in danger,” he emphasizes.
25180	16	Antibodies are molecules naturally produced by our body to fight infections, but they can also be produced in the laboratory and later administered to patients. Although several antibodies have already been developed for COVID-19, their effectiveness has always dropped strongly in the face of new, highly muted variants, such as Omikron.
25180	18	How do the antibodies work?
25180	20	- The antibodies attach to the virus in a very specific way; they fit to it as a key to the lock. When the virus mutates, the key doesn’t fit anymore, says Subramaniam. We are looking for universal keys. These antibodies neutralize the virus even after large mutations.
25180	22	Such a universal key identified in the described study was a fragment of the VH Ab6 antibodies. Experiments have confirmed its effectiveness against the variants Alfa, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, Epsilon and Omikron. The fragment neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by connecting to the epithop on the gall protein and blocking the virus before it penetrates into human cells.
25180	24	- The epitop that we describe in this publication is not covered by the so-called hot points of mutation, therefore it isined in a very similar or unchanged form in different variants, says the author of the study. Now that we’ve been able to describe its structure in detail, a completely new possibility of treatment has opened to us.
25180	26	"According to Dr. Subramaniama, this kind of ""pete achilles"" virus can be used by pharmaceutical manufacturers not only to create effective remedies against current dominant variants, but also those that will appear in some time."
25180	28	We have a full picture of this sensitive place. We know every interaction in which coli protein can enter with the antibodies in this region. So we can develop a lot of different antibodies therapies – summarizes Subramaniam. 
25180	30	"""And having widely effective, working on various variants of drugs, would completely change the rules of the game in a continuing pandemic,"" he predicts."
25182	1	There is no climate threat
25182	3	This is what the World Climate Declaration says, the content of which was published 18.08. In 2022, it was signed by more than 1,100 scientists from all over the world, including several Nobel Prize winners.
25182	5	The comments that have appeared around the world on this topic range from enthusiasm to a skeptical assessment of the possibility of practical use of it.
25182	7	The first states that the existing political fiction that people are causing the majority or all of the climate change, and the claim that the science behind this concept is “stopped,” was brutally hit by the World Climate Declaration (WCD) publication signed by more than 1,100 scientists and professionals.
25182	9	There is no climate crisis, says authors from all over the world and the declarations have been developed under the guidance of Norwegian Nobel Prize laureate in physics, Professor Ivar Giaever. This declaration claims that climate science has turned into a discussion based on beliefs, not a healthy self-critical science.
25182	11	The commentators of this report cite its conclusions that we should get rid of the naive belief in unmatched climate models, and in the future climate research must put much greater emphasis on empirical science. The gap between the real world and the modeled world tells us that we are far from understanding climate change.
25182	13	The declaration further states that the Earth’s climate has changed since the existence of the planet, with natural periods of cold and heat. It is not surprising that we are in a warming period. It is said that climate models have many disadvantages and are not even a bit reliable as a tool for global policy.
25182	15	These models expose the action of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, but ignore any beneficial effects. The report states that CO2 is not a pollution. It is essential for all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial to nature by greening the Earth; additional CO2 in the air contributes to the growth of the plant biomass in the world. It is also good for agriculture, increasing crops and providing more food.
25182	17	These are just the selected fragments of this declaration that burns the whole bubble of the climate warming theory. Sceptics notice that although this statement is an event of great importance, it will be ignored by the main media. But this is not the first time that prominent scientists call for greater realism in climate sciences. Of course, green extremists in the academic, political and journalistic environment will continue to argue for the desired implementation of the Net Zero policy.
25183	1	Will Putin take advantage of Dugin’s death? “Kreml can stimulate its society”
25183	3	After the death of Daria Dugina, the daughter of the Russian ideologist, experts are convinced that Russian propaganda will use the mysterious event to raise anti-Ukrainian moods and interests in war in Ukraine. On the other hand, the Kremlin will not be interested in the mythology of Alexander Dugin and his ultra-nationalist views. We are waiting for a further internal service game in the Kremlin. They will first use the attack to move on to the agenda later, experts say.
25183	5	Remember, on Saturday evening in a car explosion on the highway under Moscow died Daria Dugin, daughter of Alexander Dugin, one of the main ideologists of the Kremlin, a supporter of Russian imperialism and the invasion of Ukraine. Dugin had to ride the car, but at the last moment he moved to another vehicle. According to the Russian Security Service (FSB), the attack was organized and carried out by a Ukrainian citizen. However, it was quickly revealed that the evidence of her guilt was spread. The Ukrainian authorities have strictly dismissed the incident.
25183	8	"At the same time, in Russia – according to the independent portal Meduza – the interest in war is falling. The Russians are getting tired of the topics related to the ""special operation"" in Ukraine."
25183	10	As the portal reports, the results of the research carried out by the private holding company Romir also indicate this. “Their results show that the viewability of the most important federal channels has decreased by at least eight percent. Most of the antenna time on Russian television is now occupied by political talk shows, where hosts and participants talk about Ukraine and “the enemy countries of the West” – we read in the analysis.
25183	12	“Kreml will stimulate society”
25183	14	Will the Russian propaganda then use the attack on the daughter of a Russian ideologist to re-interest war? Will it build the Dugin myth on the basis of a mysterious event? According to experts, with whom Virtual Poland talked, due to the internal struggles for power in the Kremlin, the topic of the attack will be short-term.
25183	16	It seems that the Russian society is actually getting tired of information about the war in Ukraine. The Russians are ceasing to respond to the events on the front, in the same degree as at the beginning of the conflict, says Michael Marek, an expert on the virtual Poland. Dezinformation in Russia, the chairman of the Foundation Center for Research on Modern Security Environment.
25183	18	"As he emphasizes, this is why “any event that can stimulate emotions in connection with the war is beneficial from the perspective of the Kremlin.” The murder of Daria Dugina is likely to play this role now. But in the long run, even this ""mithic"", the issue of the attack will not be translated into the mood of the Russians. They will go to everyday affairs, and the topic will be forgotten, adds."
25183	20	And as he emphasizes, the Russian propaganda centers are using the attack for one purpose. Heating anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western emotions. The main narrative is the blame of Ukraine, but there is also a blame of responsibility of the Western services. As a mantra, the slogan is repeated that it is a war between Russia and NATO. The Kremlin is building continuous support for further actions in Ukraine, says Michael Marek.
25183	22	Professor Daniel Boćkowski from the Department of Security of the International University in Belarus. “The Kremlin after the attack can encourage society to re-interest war. The Russians are unhappy in this, but they are also painfully predictive. Dugin is indeed a pro-Kremlowski ideologist, but that’s more his daughter was in Russia on top. She appeared very frequently in propaganda materials, calling for hatred against the West and Ukraine. It was identified with the system. The Kremlin may want to take advantage of this, says Prof. Daniel Boćkowski.
25183	24	"""Dugin is not a guru in Russia"""
25183	26	"According to him, the attack on Dugina ""not resonates to a great extent"" in Russia itself. “Maybe only among the ultra-nationalists calling for revenge in Ukraine. The Kremlin will not mythologize the daughter of Dugin, because the myth would become Dugin himself. It was a reflection of his ideology. Ultranacionalism is good in Russia for extremely pro-war politicians and businessmen who make money on the conflict. But it doesn’t have to be in the interests of the oligarchs who lost their wealth, their yachts and the possibility of traveling around the world, says Prof. Daniel Boćkowski."
25183	28	"As wrote in a comment for the weekly ""The Spectator"" Professor Mark Galeotti, the author of books about Russia, although many people in the West consider Dugin as ""Putin's brain"" or ""Putin's Rasputin"", however, he is not, and has never been, especially influential and has no personal ties with the Russian president."
25183	30	According to the scientist, Dugin is one of a whole series of “political entrepreneurs” who try to present to the Kremlin their plans and doctrines.
25183	32	"""For a moment, in 2014, he was on a wave because his claims about the civilizational purpose of Russia and the status of the Eurasian nation were convenient in the rationalization of the landslide in Donbass. But later, Dugin has ceased to be useful,” says Mark Galeotti."
25183	34	Ideology for the Kremlin
25183	36	According to Prof. Daniel Boćkowski, Dugin was functioning in the Russian political system thanks to the fact that it was paid by the Kremlin. The system paid Dugin, the authorities used it as a tool. His concepts, the vision of the world, the views – were once less needed, another time more. Moreover, it flows on the mouth. As less, it circulated in the environment of its ultra-nationalists and no one disturbed him. And his daughter glowed with a bright light, without having a special idea what to do, signing his philosophical analyses with the pseudonym Daria Płatonowa, says WP Prof. Daniel Boćkowski.
25183	38	According to our speaker, behind the attack continued internal games in Russia. No Russian national army or Ukrainian service. But Putin has not decided about it either. We must stop idealizing the Russian dictator. For the last 10 years we have in Russia a propaganda project that Putin is all-powerful. And it is not. He does not decide everything. Putin is not a god. Even if he wants, he is not even Stalin. It is part of the system. We don’t know if it was he who made it for himself or others who made it for himself. Let us remember that war is business. In the conflict, some groups in Russia do interests, and others lose. Here I would more seek to unleash the mystery of the assassination, says Prof. Daniel Boćkowski.
25183	40	In turn, Michael Marek from the Foundation of the Center for Research on Modern Security Environment predicts that similar attacks – such as those on Dugina – may continue.
25183	42	But not immediately. The current event will be shut down, and later we can be witnessing more, similar explosions. For the attack on Dugina, the services were as well able to stand as well as the Kremlin factions. In the case of the murder of the daughter of the Russian ideologist, the case is very unclear. However, it is worth paying attention to one confusion. It was that the body was found burned in the car. The photographs and recordings show that the body of Dugina was, however, outside the car, thrown on the ride. So we can assume that there was someone else in the car, which the Russian side does not report. So the question is: was this Dugina the real target of the attackers? — asks Michael Marek.
25184	1	Ziemkiewicz: The government is doing bamboo again
25184	3	“Mrs. Von der Leyen sets institutional rules in Poland,” says Rafał Ziemkiewicz, publisher “To Things”.
25184	5	"In a recent interview with the ""Journal of Law"" Ursula von der Leyen assessed that the Upper Court Act amendment, which came into force in mid-July, does not guarantee judges the possibility of questioning the status of other judges without the risk that they will be attracted to disciplinary responsibility."
25184	7	This issue must be resolved in order to meet the conditions for the allocation of funds from the National Restoration Plan (i.e. Stones of Miles (Red) and allowing the Commission to initiate the first payment, she emphasized. And she added that Poland must also fully comply with the ruling of the Court of Justice, which has not yet occurred.
25184	9	“In particular, suspended judges have not been returned to judgment and the daily financial punishment remains in force,” the Chairman said. Her speech is widely commented in the media and the topic of loan to the Polish KPO without interruption is one of the dominant topics that politicians and media talk about.
25184	11	Ziemkiewicz: The government makes it in bamboo
25184	13	“Mrs. Von der Leyen establishes institutional rules in Poland,” said Rafał Ziemkiewicz at Television Republic. A publicist asked about the request of the European Commission to divide the functions of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice in Poland said that the solution itself can be discussed, but it is not Brussels should decide on the form of the Polish justice dimension.
25184	15	The issue of organizing justice in a country is not a matter that the European Commission has the right to decide. European treaties are already a pure maculature, that’s a long time behind us, no one takes care of them,” he said. It is the fifth time that the government is doing bamboo. This is repeated every time. How many times this can be done, the publicist added.
25184	17	Ziemkiewicz said that the European Commission is concerned not merely with the exchange of governments in Poland, but with the paralysis of the whole country. The judge has the right to undertake the judgment of another judge.
25184	19	It is like a liberum veto. This demand for further changes in the jurisdiction is simply the paralysis of the state. Any fool can underweight the judgment and underweight the judge because he does not like it. The judge “Lugańsk”, which we have, can recognize a judge as a... non-judge. If Poland is paralyzed, it is a judge state in the state. Under the protection of the Union, Germany. I repeat, the lawyer Lugansk is doing so – said the publicist “To Things”.
25185	1	Texas knows what to do with illegal immigrants. He sent them to New York and Washington.
25185	3	On Sunday, a second bus with immigrants passed the southern border to New York. The Republican Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, claimed that he was testing the involvement of the city, which itself called the “sancture” for these residents.
25185	5	Due to the crisis caused by the ideological governments of the Biden-Harris administration, the southern border of the United States is crossed by countless intrusions, including associated with Mexican drug cartels, criminals, dealers and persons responsible for numerous crimes in the territory of the United States.
25185	7	While the left-wing authorities in Washington consistently refuse to resolve this crisis and finish the border wall, most of which was built by Donald Trump, the conservative governor of Texas decided to try pro-immigrant ruling statements from the Democratic Party.
25185	9	The second bus with immigrants arrived in New York on Sunday, where they were welcomed in Manhattan by mayor Eric Adams. The politician attacked the Catholic Governor Greg Abbott, claiming that he “users” immigrants for political games.
25185	11	The New York Post remarked that Abbott has sent more than 6100 migrants to Washington since April “in response to the policy of open borders of the U.S. Democratic administration, Joe Biden, which oppresses the Texas community.”
25185	13	The local radio 1010 WINS noted that New York taxi drivers transported newly arrived refugees for free to special shelters.
25187	1	President Andrzej Duda signs carbon supplement bill
25187	3	President Andrzej Duda has signed a carbon supplement bill, which imposes a payment of 3,000 dollars. All household farms are heated with carbon, the PAP on Thursday evening at the President's Office.
25187	5	In accordance with the law to receive a coal supplement of 3,000. You will have to submit a request for payment to the municipality by 30 November. The company will have a maximum of 30 days to pay for it. It will also be exempt from the tax and the possibility of employment. The condition for receiving a coal supplement will be the entry or reporting the heating source to the Central Building Emission Registry.
25187	7	In addition, the law provides that the BGK will be able to draw loans and issue bonds on the domestic and foreign markets, from which the funds will be used to create a credit line for energy enterprises. This is intended to ensure the continuity of the heat supply to the recipients for housing or public utility purposes, in particular for the purchase and billing of carbon. The maximum amount of the loan is 20 million.
25187	9	The new legislation provides that the maximum limit of coal supplements expenditure will be 11.5 billion PLN, and the funding source will be the COVID-19. The law provides that the NBP will transfer to that Fund a portion of its profits as long as it is greater than it is established in the budget law. According to the IMF, the NBP will be about 9.5 billion zlotys. In addition, the law provided 2 billion zlotys for guarantees for the credit line that BGK is planning to create for heating companies.

25188	15	The percentage of respondents claiming back-to-back restrictions due to the epidemic in people aged 70+ is lower and is 58%. 15 per cent. Definitely yes, 43 percent. Or rather so).
25188	17	Electoral voters are supporting strengthening
25188	19	The voters of Law and Justice are the largest group that supports the return to the constraints. 66% agree with this idea. surveyed (13 per cent) Definitely yes, 53 percent. Or rather so). The opposite views are mainly made by those who vote for the Confederation. No one of them supported the restoration of exacerbations due to the increasing number of coronavirus infections in Poland.
25188	21	The United Surveys survey was conducted on July 29-31 at a representative 1000 Poles test using the CAWI method.
25189	1	Is there another wave of shrinking?
25189	3	At the end of July, the Minister of Health Adam Niedzielski stated that the summit of the summer wave of the Covid-19 epidemic is expected in the “rounds of mid-August.” In this context, more and more reports appear in the media about the restoration of sanitary stricts, which were eliminated just a few months ago.
25189	5	These forecasts raise a lot of concern and anxiety in society. In 2021, Poland took the first place in the number of excessive deaths in Europe. Our lawyers know perfectly what drama the Polish families were facing at the time. Until today, we represent the family of the man who died of a heart attack before the prosecution authorities, because health workers have mistakenly interpreted the symptoms of the infarction as the symptoms of Covid-19 and have not given him the necessary assistance in time, showing the patient and his family a lot of negligence and indifference. 
25189	7	We also defend a physiotherapist who was released from the hospital only because he did not want to vaccinate against Covid-19 and a physician who will be responsible before a disciplinary medical court for the signing of an open letter by a physician calling for a fair scientific debate on the pandemic strategy.
25189	9	A series of actions taken and planned by Ordo Iuris aims to make the reactions to this and other disease rational and to be based on reliable scientific debate rather than emotions, censorship of public debate and uncritical follow-up of the recommendations of international agencies such as the WHO and the EU institutions.
25189	11	With a team of experts since the autumn of last year we have worked on the wider scientific monography in Poland on the legal, medical and economic effects of sanitary aggravations of the pandemic period. The conclusion of the work and the publication of the book is perfectly matched in the moment when epidemic regulations are considered again.
25189	13	It is time to replace the emotions with a reliable and scientific approach that will allow to take an effective and rational response to the next wave of coronavirus infections, combining the care of the health of the Poles with respect for their rights and freedoms and the economic consciousness of the consequences of the decisions taken.
25189	15	Soon there will also be a post-conference publication of the Symposium “About the Pandemic” organized at the Academy of Social and Media Culture in Toronto. The document contains an article in which we have clearly demonstrated that the fight against Covid-19 transmission cannot lead to deterioration of medical care over patients suffering from other diseases.
25189	17	We are also developing a draft law that guarantees the constitutional rights of believers, preventing the rulers from re-closing churches as part of pandemic restrictions. The project will ensure the strengthening of rights and freedoms, confirming clear criteria for the assessment of pandemic aggravations.
25189	19	Since the first days of the pandemic, Ordo Iuris’ lawyers with reason and delicacy have helped all those affected by the complicated problems of the pandemic period. Advice, legal interventions, further advisors for the parish, chapelers, entrepreneurs, doctors. Always with the emphasis on the necessary rationality of the actions of the state and its services. Today is time for systemic initiatives that summarize this period and draw out conclusions for the future. With the involvement of our experts and donors, we can help build an emotional and panic-resistant system based on a rational, real risk assessment. Although this means costs, we know that no one except us will do this.
2519	2	Transparent “Vaccine makes free” is not an accident at work. The Confederation has a epidemic.
2519	4	Transparent connected to the Auschwitz camp has been one of the favourite vaccine accessories of Gregor Braun for months. The rest of the Confederates claim that they are not anti-vaccinators, but are pleasantly exploiting the social refusal to vaccinations and exacerbations.
2519	6	On Tuesday, December 14, 2021, the Confederation and anti-vaccinators organized a demonstration in the Sejm against “the compulsory vaccination, covid passports and illegal accidents.” This was not the first of this kind of meeting of the extreme right – they are held in the same place quite regularly. This time, the meeting gained a sound for the banner “Vaccine makes free” styled on the label “Arbeit macht frei”.
2519	8	Spontaneously and accidentally.
2519	10	Transparent sharply criticized the Auschwitz Museum and government and opposition politicians, which made the Confederates begin to distant from the show before the Sejm.
2519	12	“This transparent should not appear in our demonstration. This is truth. As the organizers informed, they asked the owners of this transparency. My grandfather was also in a concentration camp, so I’m not very pleased with such events,” Michael Ubraniak tweeted. In a similar tone, Artur Dziambor spoke in a conversation with the “Rzeczpospolita”:
2519	14	“The situation was very simple. We organized a picket, this photo, was taken before. The man who held this transparent was expelled from the front of the event. Instead, the fact that someone with such a transparent appeared, invited to such a picket, is the emotion that is awakened in the crowd by the segregation policy.”
2519	16	On the available recordings, however, it is seen that politicians for a long time spoke on the background of the writing, calling for photos with it. The banner did not appear anywhere – it was brought by a group of anti-vaccin activists Justina Socha, the head association “STOP NOP”, the former candidate of the Confederation to the European Parliament, and above all – the social assistant Gregor Braun.
2519	18	For the first time, it was heard of them in December 2020, when a march of people dressed in camps passages passed through the boats. It is also a “vaccination makes it free.” The meeting was organized by Piotr Jawornik, also the social assistant Gregor Braun.
2519	20	Norimberga 2.0: “You’ll be hopeful”
2519	22	Gregor Braun himself is an anti-vaccinator and a promoter of historical analogues. “Norymberga 2.0” – another of the transparents that appeared on Tuesday under the Sejm – is his authorship program of the documentation of “human murder” managed by Sunday, Dworczyk, Morawiecki and the subordinate services and state bodies. For months, Braun has been traveling throughout Poland and speaks on the ages of conspiracy theories about the epidemic and promises the settlement of the ruling elites.
2519	24	These are the people who have committed in the past almost two years a variety of crimes against the health, life, the property of the Poles, the security, the defence of the Polish State. These are criminals in the criminal sense, people who have on the conscience of cases and deaths attributed to the fashionable and prompted in this season,” Braun said on August 2 in Jaśle. And he reminded that in Nuremberg the criminals were sent to the saft. 
2519	26	On the 16th of September, he told the minister on Sunday that he would suspend, for which he was financed. Shortly after that, he launched on the portal zrzutka.pl a collection for the project “Norymberga 2.0”. So far, he has been able to collect about half a million dollars.
2519	28	Are they working or are they not working?
2519	30	While Gregor Braun’s position on vaccines against COVID-19 is clear – the politician actually does not describe them differently than as “medical experiment” and “human murder”, so the rest of the Confederation politicians tried to dismiss them, using a slightly milder rhetoric.
2519	32	“The goal of the Confederation is not to vaccinate as many Poles as possible. The aim is to give Poles a vaccine that is safe, tested, ensuring that Poles will not be damaged. There is no such situation at the moment. The vaccines that are given are the preparations weakly tested, quickly tested. Preparations that simply don’t give security guarantees,” said Michael Wawer, a member of the Confederation and the National Movement, during a summit in January 2021.
2519	34	The official profile of the Confederation also publishes anytime on social media data that is supposed to indicate the inefficiency of vaccines. The last edition comes from December 11:
2519	36	Of course, the more people vaccinated in the population, the more infections and deaths among vaccinated. If all were vaccinated, these data would look even worse to the disadvantage of the vaccinated – because only they would be in these tables. These data also do not take into account the key indicator, i.e. the participation of people vaccinated in hospitalizations. Finally, even the numbers presented in this way indicate the effectiveness of the vaccines, which has scattered the Confederation of a number of Twitter users.
2519	38	Soon later Janusz Korwin-Mikke announced that the vaccines, however, are already safe and for a while also effective. Vaccination is suggested to older people who are most likely to die as a result of infection. Children should not be vaccinated, because, according to the policy, it is better for them to be infected and gain natural immunity. For according to Korwin-Mick, they are threatened by this “only” PIMS, a multinational inflammatory syndrome.
2519	40	Similarly, a few months ago, the position on vaccines was formulated by Krzysztof Bosak, saying that “persons who think this is a good solution for them should vaccinate against the coronavirus.”
2519	42	I am not an anti-vaccinator, but...
2519	44	It is true that most of the leading politicians of the Confederation are not anti-vaccinators. The career on the internet has been made for a few days by the 2019 record, on which deputy Dziambor during the meeting with the voters in Sosnowc in December 2019 says as follows:
2519	46	“I am not an anti-vaccinator. I did not join that movement. I'm a doctor's son, I have a little child I'm vaccinating. I can’t imagine a struggle for everyone to do what they want. I can’t be a freelance [...]
2519	48	I just think it is necessary to be responsible, and I see responsibility in such a way that I listen to people who are wiser than me in specific areas. For some reason, all doctors vaccinate their children, and people who are not doctors and don’t know about it try not to vaccinate them.”
2519	50	Diambor's statements come before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but it's hard to not notice contradictions in his current attitude to the appeals of doctors to lead to vaccination as much as the population can. His actions are going in the opposite direction.
2519	52	Confederates simply see how large reaches can be achieved by skillfully playing on the “resistance gene” and using the fire of the anti-vaccinated environments and how great the mobilization potential of this topic is. Thus, although they are not anti-vaccinators, they take the example and engage in the fanatic anti-vaccination actions of Gregory Braun. The famous “Congress of Confederation” – alongside Jews, gay, abortions, taxes and the EU – was joined by vaccines.
2519	54	And so that there is nothing
2519	56	In August, Braun, claiming that he was carrying out business inspections, appealed to the Headquarters of the Registering Office of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Products and Biochemical Products and asked his head, Gregor Cessak, “to review the clinical trials of populations under the age of 12.” He accompanied M.I. Extremely right-wing blogger Marcin Rola, former TVP presentator Jan Pospieszalski and authority of pandemio-sceptics, Dr. Katarzyna Ratkowska.
2519	58	In December, the deputy tried to make a similar unprecedented and inaccurate, but for this transmitted, parliamentary intervention in the Ministry of Health. This time he was accompanied by the Deputy of the Confederation and National Movement Robert Winnicki.
2519	60	In 2020, Braun was repeatedly excluded from the ceremony and punished for lack of a mask at the plenary hall. At some point, another member of the Confederation, Jacob Kules, began to engage regularly in his action of “possical disobedience.” Kulesza also celebrated in recent days with an announcement that he is participating in the Seymour ceremonies as a carrier of the coronavirus. “The joke” was that the deputy gave patterns of low pathogenic coronavirus, responsible for seasonal, mildly passing respiratory infections.
2519	62	On the 15th of December, the Health Commission had to work on the long-published draft law on covid safety principles in the workplaces. But there were too many members – the entire Confederation club and their guests – all without masks. The meeting was blocked.
2519	64	The case is so absurd that PiS, in fear of its own “anti-vacciners” in the coalition, overturned the tooth law. The new rules lead to the fact that entrepreneurs will be able from time to time to ask their employees to perform an antigen test.
2519	66	However, it turns out that the tests are not in the taste of the Confederation politicians, because – as Artur Dziambor announced on Twitter – putting a patch into the nose is very unpleasant.
2519	68	The Confederation can afford to hunt the pandemic right-wing elektorate, the populist program in the style of Christoph Kononovich – “Let’s be nothing.” No lockdown, no shrinking, no masks, passports, covid divisions, vaccines. They will not bear political responsibility for the deadly disaster, and if they have been swallowed themselves – as their numerous statements indicate – they will not bear any personal responsibility for theories and postulates they have proclaimed.
25190	1	The more OZE, the easier we can do without gas and oil from Russia. The government should wake up.
25190	3	The war in Russia has caused an energy crisis. Everyone accelerates the development of OZE. The desire of Polish entrepreneurs and residents to invest in these cheap energy sources is enormous, but it blocks the energy networks that have not been invested for years and the legal barriers with which the government delays its elimination.
25190	5	Renewable sources have a huge potential to lower energy prices and independent economies from fossil fuels. Especially the Russian. With the development of new technologies and the increasing scale of investment in OECD, the cost of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines has decreased by several decades, while increasing their efficiency and durability.
25190	7	OZEs are no longer expensive and subsidized, only cheap and competitive in relation to coal and gas power plants.
25190	9	In Poland, the power installed in renewable sources is already close to 20 GW, which corresponds to one-third of the total power installed in the electricity system.
25190	11	According to the Bloomberg NEF analysts, the single cost of producing electricity (LCOE) from photovoltaics, otherwise the limit price indicator of energy guaranteeing investment profitability, is currently lower by 86%. compared to 2010.
25190	13	For wind turbines, the LCOE decrease is 46%. This is the fact that the costs of raw materials, production and transport have increased over the past few months.
25190	15	New land wind farms and large solar power plants are around 40 percent in the world. Cheaper than new coal and gas power plants – reports Bloomberg NEF.
25190	17	The decade cost reduction trend has been reversed in the past year, but the cost distance between OECD and fossil fuels continues to rise due to the even faster rise in gas, coal prices and expensive CO2 emissions on the EU market. Investments in cheaper and cleaner sources of energy are accelerating almost all over the world, and China is leading here first.
25190	19	Last year, almost 295 GW of new power came to the world, this year the International Energy Agency expects 320 GW, which is an increase of 8%, higher than last year.
25190	21	The first place is photovoltaic, the cheapest, most common, ready to be used in large-scale solar farms, as well as small, household installations that are used by prosumens.
25190	23	Importantly, Poland is in the world’s leading countries where solar energy is developing the fastest, which is mainly responsible for the owners of single-time houses, who in recent years have massively invested in microinstallations. This is changing now.
25190	25	The Miracle of the Sun
25190	27	Looking only at the outcome of solar energy, you can estimate that Poland is in the avant-garde of energy changes. Last year there were 3.8 GW of new solar power in our country, a 56% increase. year to year. In the Solar Power Europe set, for the first time, Poland appeared among the market leaders, ranking third in the European Union, after Germany and Spain, and 10th in the world.
25190	29	“This is a positive surprise that most solar market analysts did not expect,” the organization said.
25190	31	What is worth emphasizing, the Polish government also did not plan such a rapid development of solar energy. The strategic document “Polish Energy Policy to 2040” (PEP 2040) predicted that at the end of this decade in Poland will be about 5-7 GW of solar power, while in May this year this power already exceeded 10 GW.
25190	33	In the last seven years, there has been a sharp increase in power in photovoltaics in Poland.
25190	35	for almost 80 percent. These investments correspond to microinstallations up to 50 kW, mainly on the roofs of Polish houses, but also in supermarkets, offices, warehouses, production halls.
25190	37	Clean profits from the sun
25190	39	The success of photovoltaics was determined, among other things, by the system of calculation of the energy produced by prosument in microinstallations, subsidies from the “My Power” program, the calculation of the expenditures for photovoltaics as part of the thermomodernization relief and the decline in the prices of photovoltaic panels.
25190	41	Subsidy up to 5,000. The PLN from the “My Power” program, initially funded from the revenues of the state budget from the sale on CO2 auctions, generated about 20,000. Investment on the prosumer side. No other technology in energy could praise such fast and spectacular effects.
25190	43	The government did not foresee such a large investment breakthrough for the Poles, which eventually led to the initial reduction of the subsidies in the “My Power” program, and eventually to change this year the system of prosument billing to less favorable.
25190	45	While the future of roof microinstallations remains uncertain, the segment of large-scale solar farms flourishes. As a result of the last year’s auctions, 6.5 GW of new power has been contracted in solar farms, which are able to meet the country’s energy needs in a short time.
25190	47	With current high electricity prices, the return from the investment in a solar power plant is made within 5 years, after which the investor can already count on a net profit. On the way of investors to the solar eldorada is now only one, but behind it a huge, obstacle – obtaining the conditions of connection to the electricity network.
25190	49	Without the network there will be no
25190	51	The distribution network operators have been overwhelmed by requests from investors who want to connect mainly photovoltaic farms to the network, because – unlike wind farms – they do not face significant regulatory barriers. Most of the proposals are rejected.
25190	53	“There are reasons to close the network because the conditionMilstone under the wind
25190	55	There is no chance for rapid development of wind energy. In Poland, it supplies the cheapest energy, which is due to geographical conditions and the maturity of the technology itself, however, the projects of new wind farms have rapidly stopped one law, introduced in 2016 by the United Right Government, baptized as the “anti-ventilation” law.
25190	57	He introduced the so-called The 10H rule prohibits the construction of wind turbines at a distance of less than 10 times the height of the wind turbine from buildings and protected areas. In practice, it excludes 99 percent from wind energy. territories of the country. As a result of the winnings in the last years of the auction, projects of wind farms are implemented, which have been approved before the anti-ventilation law has entered into force.
25190	59	New ones are no longer emerging and many indicate that they will not be emerging in the coming years.
25190	61	The wind industry has been trying to liberalize the 10H rule for years, but the project of such a change
25191	1	Definition of Standards
25191	3	Good that there is no device in the world to measure hypocrisy. If it existed, the scale would unfortunately have to be adjusted on the Village Street in Warsaw. It’s hard to imagine that we could fall down. I transfer?
25191	5	Well, I inform you that the expert of the Campus of Poland from the height was Barbara Kurdej-Satan, who wrapped in Poland the vulgar call of the Border Guard. A little? This might be the impression that Donald Tusk will make, who laughs with... the discourse and obsession of Jaroslav Kaczynski. What will be the next? Richard Kalisz laughing at someone that he was stumbling? Franek Sterczewski is angry on drunk cyclists? Or Sylvia Spurek eating wool kebab? Everything is probably already possible, because it turns out that politicians are changing their views more and more often, requiring stability only from political opponents. They do not see their defects. And so, Donald Tusk, who will not correctly pronounce the name “rabar”, will laugh at the expression of the President of PiS, and Barbara Kurdej-Satan, who starts his expression from “k...wa”, will teach about the heath. And then, of course, everyone is surprised that Poles politics is linked to the shambes, and the electoral frequency we have at the bottom level. Very strange, right?
25193	1	Elon Musk about women. Korwin-Mikke replied: I’ve always said about it
25193	3	The popular and excentric billionaire Elon Musk posted a short post about women. It was made by Janus Korwin-Mikke.
25193	5	The opinion of women that joined Korwin-Mick and Musk will not like feminists. The attention of the American billionaire is, of course, increasingly rarely heard in the so-called The main drop.
25193	7	What did Musk say? For women, it is just as important as a career to be a mother.
25193	9	“Being a mother is as important as any career,” Musk wrote in his very short, but boring posts.
25193	11	The same answer was given by Janusz Korwin-Mikke. “Lightly! I have always talked about it! The most important are women!” wrote the monster of the Polish liberals.
25193	13	Although many women in the comments admit Musk right and share their testimony, it does not lack the opinion that this is the prejudice of women that the world has changed and is no longer the way Musk sees him. Even after Korwin-Mick's response, there were a few voices that suggested that for the Confederation policy women are not the most important, because he would prefer to lock them at home, bring them into the role of the housewife and ban them from working.
25193	15	How did Korwin-Mikke respond to this kind of argument? “There’s a time when men were scratching women, and now you’re sitting behind a desk, watching a newspaper, and four ladies are scratching around the office like a dwarf and working. And these feminists still seem that it’s good that it’s in their favour,” he said in one of the interviews.
25193	17	“Women don’t want to move these boxes in Biedronca, but if they want to paint, for example, let them paint. Maria Skłodowska-Curie, in the times when there was no feminism, was great. No one prohibits women from doing what they want, just so that it does not ruin the logic of social life,” said Korwin-Mikke.
252	1	"Is Nord Stream 2 a ""reparation formula"", a ""compensation"" for Hitler's crimes in Russia? What the German President said?"
252	3	Polish politicians – Prime Minister, Minister at the office of the President, Vice-Chairman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs – criticized the President of Germany for the fact that he seemed to suggest in an interview that the Nord Stream 2 is a form of compensation for the German crimes committed in the Soviet Union during World War II. Such statements did not fall in the interview.
252	5	"The interview with German President Frank Walter Steinmeier, which appeared on February 6 in the journal ""Rheinische Post"" (is also available on the RFN president's website), caused a reaction of Polish politicians. The discussion was mainly dedicated to the course of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany, but at the end fell two questions about the assessment of the German-Russian relations. PiS politicians believe that Frank Walter Steinmeier's response opens discussion on compensation for Poland for war losses. For the President of Germany had to say that the Nord Stream 2 is a form of compensation for the horrors that the Germans issued to the Russians during World War II."
252	7	Only the Polish politicians refer to the words that did not fall in the interview - and appeared only in the interpretations of the conversation.
252	9	“For us, Germans, it has a completely different dimension.”
252	10	"The first of the questions on German-Russian relations asked to President Steinmeier was about the arrest and condemnation of the Russian oppositionist Alexey Navalny. The president replied: ""It is completely cynical to imprison someone who has just come to himself after the poison he has been subjected to in his home country. Russia violates the obligations that the country has undertaken in national and international law in order to protect human rights. The arrest and conviction of Alexey Navalny has nothing to do with the rule of law.”"
252	12	He added: “We need to take into account a broader picture of the EU-Russia relations. In our criticism of the internal political situation in Russia, we must be clear and unclear – and continue to look for the striking points in foreign policy again to transform the bad present into a better future.”
252	14	The second question concerned the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which after the Baltic days will be shipped from Russia to Germany – with the omission of Poland, but also Ukraine.
252	16	"""What do you think about the completion of the Nord Stream 2 construction? Are the German interests more in energy security or in loyalty to the United States?” He was told by the journalist “Rheinische Post”."
252	18	The President replied:
252	20	"“If it was so simple. But first, the dialogue with the new U.S. government on this issue has not yet begun. Moreover, it should be thought: after the continued deterioration of relations in recent years, the energy relations are almost the last bridge between Russia and Europe. Both sides should consider whether this bridge should be destroyed irrevocably and without anything in place. I think smoking bridges is not a sign of strength. How do we have an impact on the state of things that are unacceptable to us when we overtake the last flags? For us, the Germans, this has a completely different dimension: we look back to our very bitter history with Russia. There were periods of fruitful partnership, but even more periods of terrible bloodshed. June 22 is the 80th anniversary of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. More than 20 million people of the Soviet Union were victims of the war. This does not justify any wrong actions of today’s Russian policy, but we cannot lose the wider picture of the situation. Yes, we live in the present of a difficult relationship, but there is the past before and the future after."""
252	22	First Reactions Abroad
252	24	The interview was addressed by the Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin, Andrij Melnyk. The day after the appearance of the interview, February 7, Melnyk said in a statement that “the statements of President Steinmeier agreed deeply in our hearts, because Nord Stream 2 remains a geopolitical project of Russian President Vladimir Putin, contrary to the Ukrainian interests. Therefore, cynicism is to invoke in this debate the horrors of national-socialist terror and, in addition, to attribute millions of Soviet victims of the German war to the destruction and slavery of Russia alone.” Ambassador Melnyk criticized Steinmeier that he would not directly mention the many millions of victims of the Nazis in Ukraine that was then part of the Soviet Union.
252	26	"Also, some German commentators criticized the words of the President of Germany. Clemens Wergin, the ""Die Welt"" commentator, wrote on February 9 that the defense of the Nord Stream 2 by Steinmeier is a ""preaching of history."" “The German president claims that Germany has special obligations to Russia as a result of the crimes of the Nazi regime. As if other countries of the former Soviet Union did not suffer the same, and even more,” the German journalist emphasizes."
252	28	"On February 9, the British newspaper ""The Times"" described the interview of President Steinmeier and the protest of the Ukrainian ambassador in an article entitled ""We are guilty of Russia's Nord Stream gas pipeline in connection with the cruelty of the Nazis, says the President of Germany."" “German President Steinmeier has scattered Ukraine, defending the project of the Russian pipeline by the argument that his country is liable to Moscow for the cruelty of World War II,” the Times wrote."
252	30	Polish media and Polish politicians react
252	32	"With German and British comments, the discussions of the interview with the President of Germany, which appeared in some Polish media, were coerent. 10 February (on the hour) 17.06) the portal inPolityce.pl describes the interview with Frank Walter Steinmeier and the reaction of the Ukrainian ambassador titled: ""Nord Stream 2 as a compensation for Russia for Hitler's attack?! Scandalous words of the President of Germany in one of the interviews."""
252	34	"A few minutes later, Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz said in an interview with the state television that the words of the President of the Russian Federation show that Germany is ready to negotiate war repairs. “As we heard today of the President of Germany who says that the Nord Stream 2 is a form of repairs or debt repayment for the horrors made by Germany to the Russians during World War II, I have to say that it gets a new meaning. If this project should be treated in this way, then the Germans are ready to discuss the repairs,"" Dodac said."
252	36	"In a morning interview with the Polish Radio on February 11, another Vice-President of the MSZ, Simon Szynkowski vel Sęk, stated that ""speaking about the Nord Stream 2 gas station is the worst possible way of speaking about any compensation to Russia."""
252	38	"On the same day afternoon, Krzysztof Szczerski, the Secretary of State at the Office of the President of the Republic of Congo, said that on the order of the President Andrei Dudy he had a conversation with the head of the Office of the President of Germany Stephan Steinlein. As he wrote on Twitter: ""In the conversation I expressed our strongly critical position regarding the construction of the Nord Stream2 gas pipeline and the deepening of Europe's dependence on Russian gas imports."""
252	40	"At 4:00 p.m. on the ""Worksheet"" portal appeared the text. “Nord Stream 2 is a remuneration for Russia for Hitler’s invasion. In Poland and Ukraine.” The author stated: ""German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, defending the Russian gas station Nord Stream 2, suggested that it was a compensation for Russia for Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union. Such suggestions have caused flooding in Poland and Ukraine.”"
252	42	"At the same time, the portal Dziennik.pl published an article with a similar title: ""President of Germany: NS2 is compensation for crimes."" In the text it was written: ""The British newspaper (""The Times"" - red.) She said on Wednesday that Steinmeier will estimate that because of Nazi crimes Germany has a debt to Russia, and the Nord Stream 2 is one of the last'mosts' between Europe and Russia."
252	44	On February 11 on Facebook Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki wrote: “Nord Stream 2 is the worst possible form of compensation. Its implementation will not match any historical accounts – it will only improve the balance sheet on the current bank accounts of the project’s shareholders. It is an investment that is harmful to European solidarity. It is a threat to the security of Europe and one of its largest neighbors – Ukraine.”
252	46	"On February 12 in Radio Maria, PiS Joachim Brudziński asked: ""If today the head of the German state says that the Nord Stream has sense, because it is a sort of compensation toward Russia, then we must ask: What about compensation toward the Poles?“”"
252	48	“So that President Steinmeier didn’t say...”
252	50	"The historian, a scientist of Polish-German relations, Professor Stanisław Žerko from the Western Institute in Poznań, in several tweets commenting the statements of PiS politicians emphasized: ""So that President Steinmeier did not say that NS2 is a compensation for German crimes in the USSR."""
252	52	Witold Yuras, the chairman of the Center for Strategic Analysis, commented on February 12 in a text for Onet.pl that “the President, Prime Minister and Deputy Chief of Diplomacy, referring to the words of the President of Germany, referred to words that didn’t fall and based on media reports, which – obviously – were not checked at all either in the President’s Office, or in the Prime Minister’s Office, or in the MSZ.”
252	54	"Journalist Ewa Wanat in a Facebook post on February 13 noted: ""From the left to the right Polish media reports with anger that the President of Germany has suggested in an interview with the Rheinische Post that Nordstream 2 is a compensation for Russia for war losses. More Moravian and Consortes. Even Electoral. One Witold Jura in Oneta wrote how it is. Steinmeier did not say anything like that. He didn’t even suggest, as GW suggests.” And Wanat quoted the words of the German president."
252	56	Andrzej Byrt, former Polish ambassador to Germany, in a comment for Konkret24 states that nothing indicates that
252	57	The German president combines the issue of building a gas station with compensation for Russia for its war losses.
252	59	“This is an absurd accusation made by someone who has not read this interview,” said Ambassador Byrt. “There’s no irony between the construction of the Nord Stream and the compensation for the deaths of 20 million Russians. President Steinmeier says only, although more accurate, the need for solidarity with the victims of the war. From his words, it is also impossible to conclude that Germany opens a field for discussions on compensation for Poland for the losses our country suffered in the Second World War. This issue is played for internal use by people on the right side of the political scene, who, using an interview with the President of Germany, want to warm up the topic of repairs, says Andrzej Byrt.
2520	2	Covid certificates: I am not a supporter
2520	4	"The decision to vaccinate is an individual matter for each Poles, the Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, said in the morning of the Catholic Voice ""Seventh-Ninth"". “We are facing a problem of legal, ethical, constitutional nature, which cannot be easily solved,” he added."
2520	6	The head of the justice department was asked on Friday for a proposal to impose the obligation to show a test certificate or escape against COVID-19 when entering the restaurant or the church. “I’m not a supporter of such solutions because I’m a supporter of freedom,” Zbigniew Ziobro said.
2520	8	He said he personally was a vaccine. I have been vaccinated and encouraged everyone to get vaccinated. I have the experience — unfortunately sad — from the Ministry of Justice that a few people, including young people, have died, all untransplanted, which seems to confirm the thesis that vaccination increases the chance of survival in the event of a disease (...) No matter how my view of vaccination was, I see the problem of the constitutional nature in this matter” — said the guest Moranka “Sedma9”.
2520	10	There is no debate on the benefits and risks of vaccination. “I think there is no full use of the potential to reach the awareness of the Poles and tend them to make such decisions that will be the best in their belief for the health and life of themselves and their neighbors,” he said.
2520	12	Ziobro also referred to the Ministry of Health’s decision to block the wider access to amantadine. “These are such incomprehensible communications to the public that can cause unnecessary emotions, suspicions and diverse speculations that do not serve to a credible explanation of the matter and encourage the Poles to make a rational decision from their point of view,” the minister said.
2521	2	The Covid-19. European countries strengthen vaccination rules
2521	4	No one is surprised by the government decrees introducing vaccination obligations for specific social groups. They appear even in those countries where the percentage of vaccination is high.
2521	6	In a certain sense, the implementation of compulsory vaccines was inevitable, and at least long awaited. This scenario was predicted by all the participants in the pandemic dispute. Opponents, from the first days of the infection accusing governments of “sanitary fascism”, a popular term especially in the first half of 2020, have warned that politicians will be forced to injection in the final act of suppression of civil freedoms. Their supporters, in turn, supposed that even when the covid vaccine becomes publicly available, there will be a large group of those who will refuse to take it voluntarily. From the side of which not to look at the vaccination obligations introduced in Europe, it will always be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
2521	8	Vaccinations Save Hospitals
2521	10	The vaccine prohibition is also announced, and above all, in the countries where the preparation on its own will has received the relatively most inhabitants. This is the case in Italy, where 87 percent have been vaccinated. citizens over the age of 12. This country is the first, since in October last year, it also introduced the obligation to have a covid passport at workplaces in all sectors of the economy. Since April, under the threat of suspension and suspension of payments, vaccines are mandatory for medical workers and pharmacists, and on 15 December this rule has been extended to teachers and representatives of uniform services. On January 5th, a new law came into force, this time provisioning the injection to all inhabitants over the age of 50.
2521	12	Mario Draghi's government members argued they wanted to prevent the worsening of the situation in this group of society whose virus is most threatened. Although Italy, like other countries in Europe, is now observing a significant increase in infections, the next wave does not burden health services as much as in the previous two years – just thanks to vaccines. The authorities introduce mandatory vaccines in the risk groups mainly in fear of unknown variants of the virus. The fact that the omicron mildly flooded with the society does not mean that further mutations will be equally harmless, so the immunity must be strengthened with all available means. In the Italian case, accurately, this order largely sanctiones the existing state of things. Unvaccinated citizens after fifty are few, and two doses of the preparation have already taken more than 91 percent. Italians over the age of 60.
2521	14	Austria has mandates
2521	16	The first country to be vaccinated by any citizen will be Austria. On 1 February the law enters into force, according to which anyone who refuses must count on the consequences: first a reminder, from the middle of March a fine. Anti-vaccinators can be punished by a mandate of up to 3,6 thousand. the euro.
2521	18	However, the level of vaccination in Austria is 72%. – less than in Italy or Portugal, but still above the EU average – the government does not intend to apply relief tariffs. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg has even stated publicly that only the acceptance of the vaccine by all citizens can bring the country out of the endless spiral of lockdown, quarantine and fear of new variants. It is also not afraid of the protests, which are organized in Vienna and other cities almost every week. Because although loud and effective, they don’t gather the crowd. At least not enough to influence Schallenberg’s policy.
2521	20	Greece is fighting false certificates
2521	22	100 euros per month for non-vaccination will be paid by Greece residents aged 60 or more. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has been fighting anti-vacciners for several months. In October, he introduced a vaccine obligation for all medical workers, including private clinics. It also systematically reduces the possibility of participation in public life to those who do not have valid covid certificates.
2521	24	Now, as in Italy, the oldest people are forced to vaccinate. The argument is simple – up to 90 percent. The deaths in Greece are in this age group. In addition, the country grows the plague of false evidence of vaccines. According to Euronews, there are more than 100,000. Citizens may have a false certificate. In the black market, their price ranges from 400 euros in cities to just 50 euros in the poorest parts of the country. That’s why Mitsotakis imposed one of the highest penalties for pandemic fraud. Having a false certificate alone threatens a mandate of 5,000. The euro, and for its production, will come to pay up to ten times more.
2521	26	Vaccination is not enough.
2521	28	How is it in other regions of Europe? From September, the vaccine will be mandatory for French doctors, but also for people employed in transport and public communications. The Minister of Health, Olivier Véran, said that there will be no universal vaccination obligation, but it is possible to put a thesis that it would not be necessary. President Emmanuel Macron systematically limits the field to describe the vaccines, excluding them from participating in the next segments of public life. In addition, the vaccine action is going much better than expected. This is the same idea for the UK’s strategy. The government does not have the obligation, because the preparation has approved more than 90 percent. the residents.
2521	30	In combination with a clear, determined and consistent policy, this gives measurable effects. It must be emphasized that the duty of vaccination, even strictly executed and bound by severe penalties, the virus itself will not overcome. The exam is only when it is one of the many public policy instruments. Vaccinations in combination with restrictions on non-vaccinated, universal access to tests and most importantly effective information campaign really save lives – but only those who actually receive them.

2522	4	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in the number of deaths in Poland. According to data published by the World Health Organization, 19% of people died in Poland. More people than in previous years.
