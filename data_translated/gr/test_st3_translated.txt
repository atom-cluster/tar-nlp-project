381	1	Great Reset: Hunger, energy poverty and economic recession are the reward for the New Order of Things
381	3	How much are the peoples willing to sacrifice for the “future of the liberal New World Order of Things” which tends to be imposed as a new form of globalization?
381	5	The Biden government is trying to convince the whole world that the support of the “Liberal World Order” is much more important than any short-term financial pain we are experiencing at the moment.
381	7	So are people willing to pay high gas prices for the visible future and suffer from a very serious economic recession to put pressure on Vladimir Putin and Russia?
381	9	And of course to impose a (inappropriate) version of a monopoly post-war world.
381	11	Some citizens in the United States and elsewhere in the world would be willing to do so, but most would not.
381	13	In the wrong direction
381	15	On Friday, July 1, 2022, the data were released that the U.S. economy is moving in the wrong direction much faster than most “specialists” of established SMEs expected.
381	17	The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model currently predicts that economic growth for the second quarter of 2022 will be negative 2.1%.
381	19	The estimate of the GDPNow model for the growth of real GDP (periodically adjusted annual rate) in the second quarter of 2022 is -2,1 percent on 1 July, decreased from -1,0 percent on 30 June.
381	21	Expenses and investments
381	23	According to the Manufacturing ISM On Business Report by the Institute for Supply the current records of the increase in the real personal consumption expenditure in the second quarter and the increase in the real gross domestic investments had decreased from 1.7% and -13,2%, to 0.8% and -15,2%, respectively.
381	25	We are in recession.
381	27	The rate of U.S. GDP growth was negative in the first quarter and if the rate of GDP growth is again negative in the second quarter, this will mean that we are already in recession at the moment.
381	29	Negative developments in the labour market – Zuckerberg’s intervention
381	31	If it is confirmed later this month that we are already in a recession, it will not be exactly a surprise, but the good news is that so far this new economic recession is not so serious.
381	33	Unfortunately, we continue to see more signs that things will soon become much worse.
381	35	The rate of dismissals is actually beginning to accelerate, and this is true in the technology industry.
381	37	At this point, even Facebook is trying to reduce employment in classrooms.
381	39	In addition to freezing the recruits, Mark Zuckerberg also noted that the company left empty positions and plans to remove staff who are unable to respond to specific efficiency indicators.
381	41	“Realistically speaking, there are probably a lot of people in the company that shouldn’t be here,” Zuckerberg said, adding, “A part of my hope and just raising a bit of tension is that I think some of you can decide that this ecstasy environment is not for you and that your choice I accept it.”
381	43	Reduction of consumer expenditure even for food
381	45	Meanwhile, citizens cut their consumption spending at a scary pace.
381	47	In fact, a recent survey found that 83% of all Americans have “broken their personal spending due to the rising prices.”
381	49	Provident Bank found that 83% of respondents reduced their personal spending due to the rising food and petrol prices, with 23% saying they had to make “active changes” in their spending for economic survival.
381	51	According to the results of the 600 adult survey, 10.5% of respondents rejected all non-basic purchases and 72% said they made at least some changes in their personal travel habits.
381	53	The worst half of Wall since 1970
381	55	The first half of 2022 was the worst first half of the year for S&P 500 since 1970 and the index has now drowned into the area of the bear market.
381	57	All of this came a day after S&P 500 saw a quarterly loss of more than 16% – its biggest decline in a quarter since March 2020.
381	59	For the first half, the wider market index saw a fall of 20.6% for its biggest fall in the first half since 1970. It also fell to bear market, with a fall of more than 21% from the high record in early January.
381	61	It is necessary – a long-term struggle
381	63	The Biden government openly acknowledges that there is greater financial pain but they say it is necessary.
381	65	On Wednesday, June 29, 2022, CNN received an interview from Joe Biden’s key economic adviser, Brian Deese, and what he said during this interview becomes a first page worldwide.
381	67	CNN spokesman Victor Blackwell received an interview from Deese on Thursday 30 June and that Director of the National Intelligence Service Avril Haines said the war between Russia and Ukraine could be long-term and devastating,
381	69	Blackwell said, “I think everyone understands why this happens, but is it sustainable?
381	71	What do you say to those families who say, hear, we don’t have the luxury to pay $4.85 per gallon for months, if not years?
381	73	“This is not sustainable.”
381	75	Deese – who was a former BlackRock manager – replied: “What we heard from President (Biden) today was about the issue.
381	77	This is about the future of the liberal World Order of Things and we must remain stable.”
381	79	Previously they called it “new world order”, but this phrase now has so many negative manifestations that they decided to find something new.
381	81	Is the “liberal world order” even worse?
381	83	Why is it needed?
381	85	Firstly, why should we have a “world order”?
381	87	Why can we not simply try to go well with everyone instead of trying to impose our distorted values on the whole planet?
381	89	I really wish the US and Russia had just left Ukraine alone and allowed them to determine their fate.
381	91	The Pioneer and the Skies
381	93	The U.S. and Russia have been involved in a terrible proxy war and countless Ukrainians are sacrificed as pioneers in a ski – we’ll see if others will follow it.
381	95	If both sides continue to escalate this conflict, it could eventually bring us to the edge of the nuclear war.
381	97	Many are unbelievably warning about where all this stupidity will eventually lead us, but most of the world does not want to hear.
381	99	Unfortunately, many will just continue to support the “built truth” regardless of the consequences.
381	101	The first half of 2022 was full of surprises, but global events are expected to accelerate even more in the second half of this year.
3810	1	The rich prime minister appears to live a lifetime... salary conservation
3810	3	Competitions for Kyriakos and Mareva Mitosotaki with debt, luxury life, travel and increased deposits
3810	5	Do you have any doubts about the luxurious life that both the Prime Minister Kiriak Mitosotaki and Marevas Grabofsky and the predicated members of the crowded government live? They then spend a lot of money studying at the best private universities in the world. They live in spitars with huge annual energy footprint (electricity and heating). They have an immovable property that heals. Their life is in no way characterized by gravity. Travel and unpredictable life during the long weekends and three days have left time, but also the pronounced “unpredictable prime minister” to Kir. by Mizotaki.
3810	7	They are overwhelming and no one knows the interest rate with which these loans are granted by the banks. They are, of course, the same persons that legislate so that banks can get the first residence of the “red” borrowers. They are those who “memorate” by photographs of legislative provisions the crimes of bankers even against the Greek economy.
3810	9	Nevertheless, half of the ministry council, together with the prime minister of the country, of course, owes 13 million dollars. The big issue is that some of them have the same loan obligations as the previous year, over-heated means that they are not all paying their loans, but the banks do not pursue them as they do with the “red” borrowers. Many rather do not denounce the loan contracts to make the whole amount demanded and to turn to the hundreds of property they all have, who yes throw the finger into society but spend a luxurious life with loans and loans.
3810	11	On the other hand, there are also evidence that blows. It is the law that does not interfere with ethics. It’s the way to “touch” the statements. for Mr. He has a loan from his sister that was granted to him in 2018, amounting to €150,000, and he must pay it back in 2035. Questions are reasonable. Is it derived from the sickness of the sister Alexander Gordon? has been signed a loan agreement between individuals? has been paid to the supply the card of 3.6% (i.e. EUR 5.400); it is already known since 1964, when and the sickness of politicians was established – despite the lust and long resistance of the then ERP – that it is not a “sickness sickness” but “what you sickness”. Even when in 2003, under the burden of the enrichment of the staff of the modernist PASOK, the law changed, a little on the substance was changed.
3810	13	But even so, even if the pain is a typical process, “light” arise. If someone takes the statements and analyzes them, the horse of the statements comes out. For example, the prime minister. by Mizotaki. He and his five-storey family, who live in a four-storey apartment of 240 square meters in total, are called to live spending 6.035 euros a month. When you have to maintain a landscape with staff. When you have to maintain another landscape in Tennessee. When your one child, Sophia, graduated in 2019 and does not appear to work in 2020. When your other child, Constantine, in 2020 has no income, while the youngest Daphne studied at the College of Athens. Then the account is not out, no matter what your sister seems to borrow you.
3810	15	The same is the case with the Vice-President and Minister of Development. Georgiade, who appears to live he and his fourth family in a single home of 450 square meters. In Marrakech, while his monthly income, if you remove the duties, as arise from his pain, just exceeds 1,500 euros!
3810	17	For Kiriako Mitosotaki and his wife Mareva the word luxury accompanies every appearance. They are rich and they want to prove it. The question is where the money with which they spend this luxury life comes from. For not to forget, the Mitosotaki pair is in debt of the mythical amount of 1.295.928,89 euros, but it appears in 2020 that it has only paid 24.425,85 euros to the banks. If we recover it on a monthly basis – and remove the loan from his sister, in the amount of €150,000 – then we can easily conclude that for loans of a total amount of €1,145 million. Euro the Mitosotaki-Grabovsky pair pays a monthly donation of just €2,035! It is obvious that this takes an eye and exposes the banks that have borrowed them. They are the same institutions that take the first residence of people for a loan of 15,000 euros that increased it to 60,000 euros with interest and repairs. They are the same banks with the thief interest rates. Finally it is Mr. The new Bankruptcy Code was established in favour of society and banks, funds and services.
3810	19	Lost Loan for Voltaire's House
3810	21	As if all of this had not been achieved, in relation to the tremendous loan obligations that the Prime Minister’s pair declares in the statement of the Pope, the loan through which the famous Voltaire’s house was purchased is not included. In June 2006, the French company SCI Personal Ventures received a loan of EUR 900,000 from the GE Money Bank to buy – more than EUR 725,000 in cash – the house of Voltaire. It is no longer known who is paying and to what extent the loan in question, since the Prime Minister’s couple does not declare to the French company, despite the Greek company MGPG Investment Consulting IKE, which belongs to M.Grabovsky and her brother Giorgio Papazise and which has acquired the tremendous majority of the stock package of SCI Personal Ventures. All this while MGPG Investment Consulting IKE is a company that we don’t know what assets it has, since the Prime Minister’s pair has not published its assets.
3810	23	The account is out.
3810	25	There are a lot of questions, because if you read the statement, you logically conclude that the account doesn’t come out. It is believed that the latest statement is referring to the use of 2020. There the Mitosotaki couple shows a decline in revenue compared to 2019 of 29.844,53 euros. That is, from the 146,693,76 euros in 2019, their income decreased to 116,849,23 euros in 2020. Despite the decline, household magicians managed to increase their deposits within a year by 156,004,68 euros. On 31 December 2020 there were deposits of a total amount of 589.046,83 euros, when on 31 December 2019 there were deposits of 433.042,05 euros. How did they succeed?
3810	27	If we believe a prime minister who has not hesitated to submit a false statement, you’re hoping to hide Voltaire’s house in Paris, which belongs to his wife, and according to what they say in the statement, this accounting alchemy comes from the transfer of income – mostly from Mr. Grabovsky – from previous years. It is characteristic that a single transfer of income from Société Générale to France brought in the deposits of the couple a amount of $177,305,43.
3810	29	It becomes obvious that the money they appear as annual revenue reaches 72.423,3 euros – with the liquid amount of 24.425,85 euros they paid for their bank loans and another 20,000 euros according to a conservative estimate for taxes and ENFIA. On the basis of their income, the five-party Mitosotaki family is called to live with 6.035 euros a month!
3810	31	With this money it must maintain the fourth floor apartment of 240 m2. at Lykabeto, to maintain the countryside next to the Siemens's Christophark's house in Teno of a total area of eight acres with a house of 471 m2. Of course, the large-scale building with staff in Hanoi. Only the energy footprint of the house in Lucaveto (electricity and heating) costs, according to an energy inspector, the amount of 20,000 euros per year – at least 12,000 euros for electricity and at least 8,000 euros for heating.
3810	33	Of course, it can not be only the costs of housing and maintenance of three major buildings with staff in Athens, Tennessee, Hanoi and other 37 properties. The couple Mitosotaki in 2020 had to pay a fee for their little daughter at the College of Athens at up to €8,640, they had to keep their son Constantino for his studies at the Boston College in the first half of the year (the 21st September 2020 was ranked to serve his military term), while the older daughter of the family does not appear to work anywhere to have income in order to help her parents who in the statement showed to be stuck under the burden of the expenses.
3810	35	    A monthly donation of €2,035 is paid by the Mitosotaki-Grabovsky couple for loans of a total amount of €1,145 million. The Euro!
3810	37	    The prime couple saved 156,004,68 euros in 2020, despite the revenue decrease of 29.844,53 euros.
3810	38	    with 2019
3810	40	    20,000
3810	41	    Euro annually costs, according to an energy inspector, the energy footprint of the couple’s house in Lykabatto (electricity and heating)
3810	43	The Cost of a Luxury Life
3810	45	In all of this it is obvious that we have not included the family expenses of living a five-party family (wedding, bathroom, food, electricity bills, water, telephone and internet). Neither of course the precious entertainment of all these people, who are obvious – and do not hesitate to prove – that they are living a luxurious life.
3810	47	So how can they survive and maintain with their wealth – always in relation to what they include themselves in their statements – income? – Divine and disguised by the banks, it is one side of the dark side of the moon. But when the darkness of bank loans fails to balance things, there are relatives to borrow the Kir. by Mizotaki. When this version is exhausted, it is easy to transfer income from the past through the increase in bank deposits. Why did they not appear in the previous years and reached to increase the amount of bank deposits from 2019 to 2020 while we had a reduction in income?
3811	1	It’s not the fault of war.
3811	3	The government of ND has found the solution “for all sickness and all foolishness”. It is the war in Ukraine. 
3811	5	Of course, to be fair, yet at least, the various diseases and viruses have not given them to the war, but until October the tourists will leave and new pandemies will appear, no one knows. When it comes to the “blindness”, we’ll look at it immediately. 
3811	7	For the rise of the price of gas, gas, etc. is the fault of the war we say. But the rise in energy bills had begun since last August, when there was no war suspect. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3811	9	It’s your inherent attachment to “green growth”, the urgent closure of the mines, the accurate energy from the wind generators of the multinational, your fear of not research and exploitation of national energy resources. It’s also the fault that you don’t put a plate on the prices and let companies speculate unstoppably.
3811	11	For the rise in the prices of basic products and for any deficits, it is the fault of the war that caused the rise in electricity. But since May 2021, with the end of the great quarantine, the prices on the roofs had taken the lowest. No, of course, but we had and have the policy that supports the big chains, which favours the big at the expense of the small.
3811	13	We have the speculation left uncontrolled, we have the closure of the small stores that owe hundreds of euros and the arrangements to the big ones that owe thousands. When it comes to the deficits in wheat, it is the fault of policies that reduced agricultural production and made the country an export of agricultural products, an importer of everything.
3811	15	But also about the challenges of Turkey we heard that the war and the geopolitical reorganizations it brought are the fault. As if we had no violations before the war, we had no explosive rhetoric and “writing” of all international treaties. Not gentlemen of the ND, for the provocation of the Turks you and your predecessors who tolerate it are responsible. You who buy weapons systems, but defend with congress and scammers.
3811	17	In the end, you will tell us that crime and ill-immigration are the guilt of war. But not gentlemen of the ND, the crime lies in the impunity of the law, the foolishness of the “epathic” groups, the lack of prosecution. The fault of immigration is the policy of open borders, the divide of political asylum, the donation of citizenship through the exam you first implemented.
3811	19	So leave the stories. It’s not the war, but your liberal economic policies, your dependence on foreign power centers, your fearful diplomacy, and the copy from the left of a social engineering Soviet press.
3811	21	In front of all this, the National Greek Party proposes the return to the National Economy, the policy of self-sufficiency in key products, the energy independence through the mining of national lithium and natural gas deposits. It proposes an independent policy with strong national defence. It proposes a social policy without kinds of ENFIA charges, tax and adjustment clauses. It proposes the implementation of laws to all and the closure of borders to uncontrolled migration.
3811	23	And be sure that in the next elections, whenever they take place, the people will remember the “Noson” and punish the “Malakia.”
3812	1	The Greek Watergate runs Mitosotaki
3812	3	The prime minister has created his own big scandal with observations of journalists, political opponents and inter-party “enemies” whose disclosure is just beginning.
3812	5	The career of international reputation that Kyriakos Mitosotakis appears to be confirmed while at the same time becoming a writer of a black page on the latest Greek history. The prime minister makes a career as a Greek Nixon and creates his own Watergate with observations of journalists, political opponents, but – according to information – and inter-party opponents.
3812	7	The political and journalistic criticism that placed today’s Prime Minister as the head of a regime was confirmed by himself by the removal of the secret and grandson of Grigorje Demetriades from the position of the secretary of the Prime Minister and of the Panagiat Contolelius from the EIP. Mitosotakis confirmed what the journalistic investigation has revealed by making the assumption of guilt, after a period of intense attempt to deceive the public was preceded. The EIP finally, in addition to the “private” monitoring systems, watched the president of PASOK Nico Androlaki, the journalist Thanasis Kukaki, as well as others whose names will soon be revealed.
3812	9	The government with the responsibility and commands of the Prime Minister himself served as a par-state sect aimed at eradicating political opponents. He used Justice in the Novartis case as well as the European Court of Justice. and Mr. Mitosotakis cannot be assumed that the removal of his two commanders, Dimitriades and Condoleos, was done for personal reasons, nor can he save those who were murdered, creating, as he usually does, a virtual reality through the media. The information transmitted on Friday night and want the country not to receive the rescue fund from the European Union because it does not comply with the rules of law is not independent of the developments with the surveillance. The Grand Maximus is no longer just an orphan after the political euthanasia in Greece. Dimitrios, but also at the edge of the collapse.
3812	11	Under the burden of the rapid developments, it is doubtful whether Mitosotakis will choose to attend the prime minister. It is no longer considered unlikely. Mitosotakis should go to the Thessaloniki International Exhibition with an announcement of early elections, to prevent – as he may believe – the complete collapse.
3812	13	The background with the monitoring
3812	15	The telephone check of the President of PASOK N. Androlaki by the European Parliament demonstrated that it had been attempted to install Predator tracking software. Androlakis appeared quite conservative after revealing the attempt to attack his phone. He did not raise the tones politically and behaved too moderately, to the extent that there were comments within the PASOK itself that he does not want to disrupt the possible future cooperation with the ND. However, it seems that reading was not so political. Andrulaqis was afraid, as some of his colleagues told, that if he is under surveillance, then there are personal data about him that he would not want to get out to the public. It is characteristic that Pasok’s staff and famous lawyer Kosta Dalta in his post on Facebook when asked why they watched Andrulaqi replies “to be raped.”
3812	17	The disclosure of his case by the ECP was rather a matter of fortune. Andrulaqis asked the ADAE and the Prosecutor's Office of Arya Paga to investigate his attempt to follow with the Predator. But when the ADAE received the complaint one of the auditors was asked if it was a legal monitoring, even receiving irony from his colleagues why he was a party president. In the formal check, however, it was found that there was a prosecutor's order in the ECHR to monitor N. Androlaki. There was, therefore, a process similar to the one that was monitored by the journalist T. Kukaki. Initially it was attempted to monitor with the Predator and then it was officially taken over by the EIP. The disclosure of the monitoring by the EEA formed new data, which led the developments. A political one-way was created.
3812	19	Mystery with the back on the wall
3812	21	Since the first days of the disclosures on the monitoring of the journalist T. Kukaki, the government has tried to show the issue of the constitutional degradation as a misunderstanding. Government spokesman Janis Hikonomu talked about a private monitoring system that was unknown to the government. However, the journalist was clear that in addition to the monitoring software he knew that it was also linked from the EEA. Neither the government gave answers nor the media thought there was a problem. The situation changed drastically when the commander of the EPP P. Kondoleion, examining the issue in the House’s Institutions and Transparency Committee, admitted that Kukakis was under legal surveillance because it had been requested by foreign intelligence services.
3812	23	The assumption-bomb that the document had made public with information from the committee immediately examined the prime minister, under the responsibility of the European Commission. However, from the Maximus Hall it came out that the Condoleon’s reports concerned another thing rather than the Cukaki monitoring. The escapes were so fast and stumbling that four Sites, the First Theme, the Sky, the iefimerida and the Thetoc, published the same text, as if they had a response from the same journalist.
3812	25	Mitosotakis continued to be in his communications paradise and believed that removing the damage was a matter of time and miniature superiority. But suddenly came the revelation of the monitoring of Andrulaqis by the EIP. Even for the systemic media, the now proven monitoring of the leader of PASOK is not something they can and want to get through.
3812	27	Emissions of the two partners
3812	29	"The removal of Mr. Dimitriad and P. Condoleon are not closely engaged in the traditional function of the political victims made to save the leader. They are movements of ""saving"" and despair, but they are the result of many and diverse pressures. First of all, the waste cannot save the Mitostacus."
3812	31	On the first day after the election (he didn’t do well to swear) he changed the law to take the EPP under his control. He also changed the forecasts for the EEA manager to appoint the Controller, who had neither the substantial nor the formal qualifications. When the surveillance was found by the journalist T. Kukaki changed the law again so that he could not get information about the reasons for his surveillance as previously planned.
3812	33	Mitosotakis could therefore not blame anyone for the EIP and the surveys, since in various ways he was linked to the country’s intelligence services and in fact not for national security matters but for dealing with the “internal enemy”.
3812	35	The transformation of Mr. Dimitriad within a night from trusted family and personal policy to a person that gathers (and will continue to gathers) all the fire is related to the belief of Dimitriad that thus will be overwhelmed by those who have put him in the target. In the revelations about the observations takes part a large group of independent journalists from several Media. Therefore, Mitosotakis cannot use the usual tactics of immediate discovery as he did with the Document.
3812	37	He believes that the motivation of the disclosures is the interests of entrepreneurs with whom he did not align himself through Dimitriad. The truth is that a wide range of people in the ND, including entrepreneurs, communicators and publishers, had open accounts with the Prime Minister's grandson.
3812	39	Dimitriades also concentrated the discomfort of the ministers and the party mechanism (sometimes Morevas Grabovsky) about the special relationship with Mitosakis. The elections of Dimitriad left many out of the nightroom, but always with the orders of Mizotakis. For more than a year, Dimitriad’s rabbits began to bother and show it, even commenting that it favors concrete and strange interests. It was the “Step” of Marinaki who had called him a man who is under every stone you lift when it comes to “work.”
3812	41	The case of the observations and his relationship with companies linked to the alleged protagonists of the private girls made Dimitriad and even more Mitosotaki vulnerable. In the next period many will remember a lot about Dimitriades’ strange relationships, while at the same time, whether they want it or not, they will open the way to the fall of Mysotakis himself.
3812	43	In the coming days, according to information from the Maximum, there will be an attempt to reveal the disclosures as well as the journalists who did them as a result of the action of foreign intelligence services who decided to hit Mitsotaki because their own weapons systems were not supplied. Such profiles murder operations have been done in the past.
3812	45	This is what Mr. Lee does not understand. It’s not a sudden snowfall, but a snowfall that will hurt him.
3812	47	The observations are the top of a great ice mountain. Based on it are business agreements, privatizations, transactions with funds, all with the responsibility of Dimitriades and the orders of Mitosotaki. The revelations are now beginning. As it appears, the fall. As it was revealed in Nixon’s Watergate, the transfer of responsibility to others did not save him. It accelerates defeat.
3813	1	 They have destroyed the economy and now they are shrinking indifferently.
3813	3	Incredible is the courage of the leaders of the government of Kyriakus Mitosotakis, as after two years that they destroyed the Greek economy and terrorized the citizens with the pandemic, now they say... they made a mistake in the way of recording the dead! 
3813	5	In particular, the Minister of Health Tanos Pluaris, speaking to the OPEN, after clarified with a characteristic immune style that the measure of the suspension of health services will not be reviewed before 31/12, was referred again to the system of recording deaths during the pandemic.
3813	7	He repeated what had already been admitted several times that the Greek health authorities say as “covid death” even someone who died for another reason, but had... the misfortune to find a positive coronavirus!
3813	9	But what caused a lot of question is his disclosure about the changes in the death registry system already from the next week.
3813	11	From now on to the deaths we will declare we will mention how many of them are caused by covid and how many were caused by another cause but these individuals had covid. Therefore, there was no increase in deaths because the highest percentage of deaths since May and then are combined with incidents that are of any cause but are combined with covid.”
3813	12	Announces new vaccines
3813	14	While citizens live a norm, as most measures for the coronavirus have been abolished, the Minister of Health Tanos Pluaris says that vaccines are coming that will protect against infection and so... it is quite likely that they will be a reason for the return of the certificates.
3813	16	As Mr. Perris said, “the vaccines we have now protect against severe disease and not infection and therefore there is a recommendation for people over the age of 60 and vulnerable groups to be vaccinated now.”
3813	18	“Pfizer and Moderna are running vaccine procedures that will also protect against the disease with the Omicron mutation to get approval in August while for the Omicron submutations we are waiting for these vaccines at the end of the year,” he added.
3813	20	He noted about the duration of the vaccines that “we don’t know if it will be monotic or recurrent like the flu, we know that the direction of companies is to design vaccines that will catch the disease” while for the design of the pp. He said that “it is to transfer orders after September because then the updated vaccines are expected.”
3813	22	Thans Perris also explained that “there is no recommendation for vaccination to the wider population. If there is this will be done from September on the basis of scientific data. The ECDC and the competent bodies will recommend whether a general vaccination should be made or targeted to specific groups of population.”
3813	24	About the course of the coronavirus, the Minister of Health said that “in this moment we are in a drop phase of the coronavirus. This wave has the peculiarity that it concerned hospitals in simple clinics and therefore there was no pressure on the pressure on the METs.”
3813	26	Asked, finally, about the possibility of new measures from the autumn he said that “the will of most states is that we get into the logic that we coexist with the pandemic and thus work more with recommendations and cultures of protection rather than obligation. We don’t think of this but if necessary it will be done but with mild features like the use of a mask.”
3814	1	We missed the train. Literally and Transportally
3814	3	The untouched mandate of Mitosotaki-Karamanli could not have a negative impact on society and the country. The consequences of the political degradation of a dynamic means of transfer to the economy and growth of Greece are undoubted.
3814	5	Large cities, such as Blonde, Comotnia and Alexandropol, have seen train for three years.
3814	7	Cancellations of routes follow each other and passengers are eventually moved by buses and with delays.
3814	9	The railway network collapses, unconservable, breaks become everyday and projects such as telegraming in Athens – Corinth and landing in Patras, which we had started as a government, are in the air.
3814	11	The situation imposed on the train, its workers and the passenger audience by Mr. Mitosotakis and Karamanlis is tragic. The events of the last few days confirm this.
3814	13	The immobilization of the “White Wave” of TRINOSE near Decelia, which cut Greece into two and paralyzed the routes, and the breakdown of the train outside of Titoria, which indicates the responsibilities of Mr. Karamelli and the OSE in the operation of the railway network, is not an accident.
3814	15	Mr. Karamanli insists that he has launched projects of 3.3 billion. Euro in the area. It repeats it monotonously, although these projects, on the one hand, have not provided funding, on the other hand, should have been announced since 2019.
3814	17	The government systematically underestimates the railroad. The interests of the public are violated.
3814	19	It is characteristic that while, with the signature of Karamanli, the ministry-TRINOSE cooperation memorandum predicted investments of 780 million. Euro from the company, the amount included in the contract, which recently arrived in the House, did not exceed 160 million. the euro. More than 600 million. Euro obligations for investments, therefore, became air.
3814	21	And, of course, we’re talking about a contract that reduces to half TRINOSE’s low-cost routes but subsidizes it for all, which incorporates in the low-cost routes profitable routes such as Athens – Thessaloniki, which provides for the purchase of low-cost trains from the public, so that they are then rented by the private company, which has been subsidized for investment.
3814	23	The untouched mandate of Mitosotaki-Karamanli could not have a negative impact on society and the country. The consequences of the political degradation of a dynamic means of transfer to the economy and growth of Greece are undoubted.
3814	25	We lost the train for a few days. Literally and transportally.
3815	1	Just hypocrites
3815	3	So, the government of the N.D. has discovered the curry. And the TV screens were filled with the bright smile of this bright creature. Like a while ago, they discovered Siddhartha. He, as a master, also managed – with the help of his teachers, colleagues and colleagues – to accept his request and not to be expelled. Something that is likely (and hopefully) to happen – due to the publicity that his case took, one and the mobilization of local officials to his face came just a few days after the Saitou case – and with Vaphing Sassé, a Guyanese student living in Samo, whose application for asylum has already been rejected twice.
3815	5	And the tenants of the Great Majesty try to convince us that they are happy with their joy. Or even worse, they try to exploit the personal success of these young children by incorporating it – even if they don’t say it openly – into a framework of state care and care that favors such success! As if they were not the same children who lived in their stone the conditions of imprisonment in the unhuman “hospitalization centers.” As if they are not the same children who wait for their papers to legalize their own existence in the country. As if they’re not the same children, who for the rulers – and their extreme right-wing counterparts – are the “stupid,” the “invasors,” those who “do not.”
3815	7	Let us not laugh. The need is welcomed by Kyriakos Mitosotakis and congratulates the student who arrived with a plastic boat in Lesvo. The projects and days of his government, his attitude to the continuous complaints of illegal repatriations to Ebro, the micropolitical use of refugees/immigrants as a tool in the confrontation with Syriza, all other than insist on the honesty of his intentions.
3815	9	The government of the N.D. is distorted. The publications in international media (Guardian, Le Monde, Lighthouse Reports, Report Munich, Spiegel) are increasingly filled with stunning details and representations that demonstrate the pushbacks on the Ebro. The international press (there are relevant photos and three-dimensional videos) for the places of detention in the Hathaway and for the information that refugees and immigrants hostages – better slaves – want to do these re-promotions on behalf of the Greek state, in exchange, after three months of harsh persecution, to get the necessary papers and be able to go to another country. Information which, if not valid, must be rejected immediately and documented by the Government of the Netherlands and yet not through the well-known tactical scraping of those who dare to denounce the bad texts. Or through generological answers, such as those given by Migration Minister N. Mitarakis to the LIBE committee of the European Parliament, saying that “Greek authorities respond to all rescue requests and never exercise violence against people seeking asylum.”
3815	11	“All refugees can join us. It’s enough to give us the opportunity,” was the first words of the 19-year-old Kuro, as soon as his success became known. And in his smiling face, it reflects the will, the consciousness, the possibilities for a better life, which all children, all people seeking a better luck are entitled to. The strength of solidarity and inclusion is confirmed, and the unreasonable screams of intolerance, racism and xenophobia disappear.
3815	13	No, the government of the ND and personally Kyriakos Mitosotakis, are not entitled to any share of the success of Kuro Durmohmanti Bangi. Whatever photographs they get with him, or whether the Communications Scientists of the Great Maximus “bombard” channels, newspapers and sites with the plans of the including Prime Minister with the 19-year-old Iran. We still hear in our ears the xenophobic statements of the top ministers of his government. Like yesterday, we remember the scenes of shame with school captures and “hateful” parents that prevent their children from getting together with refugees. Until now, the central administration is “shaking down” the representatives of the Local Government who make the life unviable to refugees and migrants, making it difficult for them to be creative and equal in local societies.
3815	15	No, Mr Prime Minister. Nothing corresponds to you with the brightness of the curry. What it succeeded, it succeeded in contrast to your repressive policies. You, with Greece of solidarity and offer, have neither had nor have any relationship. “If the Syrians want refugees and immigrants, take them home.” Careers were built on this phrase.
3816	1	Greek and Turkish are not compatible. 
3816	3	Greek and Turkish are not compatible.
3816	5	We’ve learned A. Tsipras well. He says everything trying to satisfy everyone. This creates more problems than it tries to solve. The balance of profits and losses is negative from this foreign policy.
3816	7	The positions of the radical left are known that the Egean region has no borders, that the flag is a piece of pan, that we will risk not to spend money on defence and many more related international clisters. The top of all of this is the agreement of the Presbyters.
3816	9	Ten years ago, Syriza’s youth protested against the complex name in the city of Skopje. In order to eliminate misunderstandings, I must clarify that the young people demanded that the state should be called “Macedonia” without any specification. So well!
3816	11	A. Tsipras today complains why the government was surprised by the “Turkish Age” case. How serious this case will be. If there were disadvantages, that will be seen. Whether Turkey is entitled to make use, for advertising reasons, of the word “Igeo” depends on how everyone sees it.
3816	13	But the last one who has the right to “go out” from the right to the government, on the subject, is A. Tsipras. The government in which he was a prime minister.
3816	15	At the same time, there was a bilinguality in Syriza. Mr. Yudakis considered it absolutely normal for Turkey, which has thousands of kilometers of coastline in the Egean Sea, to use this word. The left trend turns indifferently and A. Tsipras appeared as a super-patriot.
3816	17	In fact, he said that if he was the prime minister and what happened in Madrid and in the Turkish Sea, he would come to Greece by foot. Opposition level of football doors.
3816	19	Of course, 57% of Greek citizens disagree with him, as he approves the Greek government’s manipulations on foreign policy issues. Very high, but completely justified by the facts.
3816	21	Obviously, A. Tsipras will always have to invent something to oppose the government. He had discovered that the prime minister in his congress speech did not name Turkey and had accused him of it. He had to say something to reduce a national success. After just one day, Erdogan, in a troubled state, attacked Kyriako Mitosotaki for this speech. A. Tsipras did not read well.
3816	23	A politician with the presumption of seriousness tries to build and keep his profile stable. Only so will it gain reliability. When someone, for reasons of opposition tactics, goes one right-one-left, like Orest McRay in the film “The Rider”, then no one takes him seriously. This is what Tsipras has done. When you have signed the press, you shouldn’t bother the “Turkish Eagle.”
3817	1	Tsipras: Attack on public university has a key vehicle to abolish democratic structures and transform it into a private company
3817	3	“Everyone disagrees with the draft law on higher education. Synagogues, Prytanos, Teachers' Associations, Students, 1000 foreign scientists and 1000 university students from all over Greece sign letters on his withdrawal, only Mr. Mitosotakis and Mr. Keramyo agree,” said Alexis Tsipras, committed to “to reject the attack, to restore the self-government, to double resources and human resources.”
3817	5	“It is an attack on the public university which has as a key vehicle the abolition of its democratic structures and the transformation of the academic and representative university into a university that simulates a private company,” he said, noting that this is done “in a period where accuracy is the biggest issue concerned by households and, in a period of intense geopolitical crises and tensions in the region, in a period that is a common secret that Mr. Mitosotakis seeks to find the date of the elections immediately after the end of the summer.”
3817	7	According to Al. Tsipras, the prime minister “will accelerate the election process not because he responds to the request that we have put for six months, but because he’s faced with the great accumulated misconduct that his policy itself has created and has enlarged,” as “in ‘93 and from a position of ophthide he tries to put on a row framework of total degradation and change of the rules that govern the public university” while describing “such and the fact that once again a structural change is attempted in the framework of the functioning of the public university without the minimum consultation with its officials.”

3818	5	We could divide the views of political violence into two categories: one can believe (with various variations) that the state should possess the “monopoly in the legitimate use of natural violence”, so it considers terrorism a police problem and does not care about what I will expos below. This is the case with a journalist who wrote that it was a struggle between democracy and its enemies and continued using Margaret Thatcher’s statement: “The crime is not politics. It is crime, crime.” Her support for Pinochet was not a reason enough to avoid the reporter's interconnection, nor that Thatcher had called Nelson Mandela a terrorist. We can, however, with this reason say that the division of camps into Democrats and Terrorists is rather simplifying. American examples, old and younger, are common places of the debate.
3818	7	The second approach suggests that there is incorporated violence in the existing sovereign relations, so the question is whether, when, how and under what conditions the sovereign will be able to recour to violence to disrupt these sovereign relations (in this case the “terrorism” is called “rebel city” by its thieves). The book of Kufonidina adjusts a multitude of the relevant arguments to the Greek reality and the action of 17N. One that is about common arguments of defence of armed struggle, I will try to take the words of the cash and see what in my opinion is resistant to criticism and what not.
3818	9	The Holiness of Human Life
3818	11	Our first reaction to terrorism is usually the moral deviation caused by the removal of human life. But since moral deviation is a very liquid and subjective reality (slavery has not caused any moral deviation for centuries), we must insist on the content. The supposed argument is the undisputed value of human life, in essence its sacredness. But the value of life is neither undebatable nor sacred: not only the revolutionary rhetoric and morality, but even the current morality and together our criminal law are praised by distinguishing exceptions. The (righteous) war and (legal) defense are some of them. Historically, although all the societies we know are not missing some prohibition of removing human life, very rarely this rule is unconditional. Ancient Greece excluded slaves and disabled children, a street thief or someone who attacks at night, someone who is arrested to commit misconduct with the wife of the criminal, etc., and the truth is that if with Christianity begins the universal prohibition of removing human life, this prohibition remained a complex level, even there. If the value of life is not absolute, i.e. if no one assumes absolute pacifism, then we must get into trouble determining what conditions are for us under which the removal of human life would seem to us incorrect or morally unjustified and which not. The condition of defence use of violence does not solve the problem, because, as it has been said, defence and attack are relative, not absolute situations, that is, they are subject to the political interpretation of the competing parties.
3818	13	Responsibility for missions and work accidents
3818	15	"Dimitris Kufondinas claims that the 17N killed killers, as he repeatedly describes the work accidents as the boss's murders against their workers, what Renato Kurtsio called ""white murders."" He refers to the Angelopoulos family and considers Kalyburgic marked by the fourteen dead and the hundreds of shocked (276); he claims that Greece holds “one of the highest positions in the world, with three-world killing rates called “work accidents” (280) (a factor which, by the way, is not statistically confirmed). The Mandemohorians report that they died, “morted, more correctly,” a hundred ten miners only in the 1970s, from the reduced protective measures, “to not minimize the surplus profits” (295); the armed forces had not cleaned the “Cretà S” gas from the burned materials and two other workers were killed, in February 1990; “In the twenty-five years of 17N action, more than 3,500 workers were killed in the factories and floating trees of wealth. Only in the explosion in the Corinth A.E., the Viochalco group, there were six dead and three injured. The lack of a pumping component (reverse valves) in the oxygen glucose bottles. They had calculated that the costs of the fines would be lower than the installation of the valves” (365)."
3818	17	The argument has been catalogued as irresistible, but this is not entirely certain. The corresponding literature on the responsibility for the omissions is concentrated in the books of John Harris and Jonathan Glover and is summarized in that when one leaves a murder to occur consciously without stopping it, while he knows and can, he is guilty. If this death is further beneficial, as is clear in the case of unlawful security measures, the liability is increased accordingly. The argument for the work accidents already exists in Marx and Engels, and Harris pulls it back. It copies an extract from the situation of the working class in England:
3818	19	When a person causes to another such a harm that has a consequence of death, this is called murder; if the author knows before that his energy will cause death, we call his energy murder. But when the society condemns hundreds of thousands of proletarians in a state that is necessarily exposed to a premature and abnormal death, to a death as violent as the death by sword or by sphere; when it removes from thousands of beings the necessary means of existence, imposing them other conditions of life, such that it becomes impossible for them to survive; when it forces them with the strong hand of law to remain in this state until the death follows, which is also the inevitable consequence; when it knows very well that these thousands of mortals will be destroyed by thousands of beings the necessary means of existence, and when it does not survive, and when it does not survive, and when it does not survive, and when it does not survive, and when it does not survive, and
3818	21	The fact that work accidents are not seen in the common consciousness as mortal moral accidents is merely due to the fact that our moral code is partial, is due to the justification of specific groups. The fact that it seems logical to us (‘natural law’, as Marx said) to kill workers in the Olympic projects due to the working conditions, is because the crimes of clear and economically strong people are easier forgiven, as long as they buy a football team and/or a medium-sized media.
3818	23	The question, however, is not whether there is any truth in the basic argument, but whether that truth justifies the murder. The principle of “responsibility by negligence” has been used in the philosophical discussion of terrorism and it has been pointed out that if we can agree that there is such responsibility, the question is that it should be determined what it is and what exactly means to “know” the act, when even the degree of our involvement in a act that “we have allowed it to happen” will be absolutely critical, if it is so to decide that someone must die for that reason! My view is that this argument very correctly turns our attention to the moral sins that escape from the lens of our morality, simply because the current morality is much more friendly to the powerful and to the citizens who enjoy the products of crimes against other peoples (such as when a peaceful American citizen enjoys cheap fuel for his car). But if the owner of the factory is responsible, the security officer will not have any responsibility; his assistant; his wife, if we assume that he discusses with her the problems of work; and if we assume that one of them proposed some security measure and was not accepted; how much he had to insist; no one of these calculations can get into weight with the act of imposing the death penalty by armed revenge. Therefore, this argument is politically important to the extent that it focuses our attention on the responsibilities of the criminals of the white collar or the well-heated westers who feed with the crime products of the Ford company in the factory of which in Latin America were tortured, and have the courage to preach the rest of the world for human rights, that is to those who with their omissions support mortality without throwing their own hands. It cannot lead to the moral justification of the death penalty. “The existence of wars, poverty and many more of the suffering that destroy or destroys people’s lives is due to extensive indifference, not only to motivations of manipulative volunteering.” That is where we can agree. The next step is unjustified. After all, it remains a mystery in my own eyes how leftists crying in front of the defense of the death penalty, citing humanitarian arguments, to accept execution. The difference is that this is a punishment imposed by the state, but I don’t think that the narcotic merchant or the rough murderer are people more compassionate than a factory owner.
3818	25	The Institutional Solution to Our Problems in Postpolarity Greece
3818	27	The second argument is related to the existence of a framework for institutional settlement of our complaints, which makes the armed action incomprehensible and absurd. In short, if the law protects us, there is no reason and room for self-called revengers. If we understand the criminal who would get Hitler or Papadopoulos out of the middle, it is not the same with a democratically elected government, because just there, it would be said, there are other means. Appeal and appeal to justice.
3818	29	We go back to Quebec. It speaks of the desire to punish the persecutors of the junta, which the state innocred in trials-parodies, where the persecutors had the courage to lobby their victims, with the “provocative impunity by the “European” and “Nationalist” Karamanli of the persecutors and the juntains” (173). “When Theophilogyanakos and his others were trialed at the EAT/EEA, the tortureers surrounded their victims who had the signs of animal violence. Alexis Panagulis claims rightly to the court: “Only the provision of justice can prevent self-righteousness” (174). Mallius denies at the court that eight torture persons have been tortured and convicted, including Babalis (181). It is repeated that if the state does not punish, they will do so. When Kufontin says that the phrase “the precedent of the impunity of donationism will not be repeated” (182) pointed to him, this obviously means that the source of his own violence he considers as the state’s refusal to punish the criminals that are useful to him. The question is: If justice is not identical with legitimacy, the prophecy that in the framework of parliamentary democracy solutions must always be institutional is still in force?
3818	31	The criticism of whether we are legalized in the conditions of parliamentary democracy to talk about a “chunda”, adapted to more modern data, has been addressed by G. Kalyoris to F. Terzaki. and see. And my own texts here and here) It is said there that the immetrity of the qualification of a modern democracy indicates that one must have known the true junta in order to be able to assess the difference. He refers to persecution in Russia, Turkey and Iran, to make the extent of the excess in the Turkish rhetoric greater.
3818	33	If it comes to whether there are worse, the answer is that there are much worse, and in this regard it is always comfortable to see that the situation is much better here than in Turkey or Iran. But when Kalyris says that in today’s Greece no one is prosecuted for his ideas, he is not right. There are cases of anarchists such as Theophilus or Sakka who awaken people outside the circle of their companions, just because their persecution was considered politically divisive and legal. The same when the administrator of a satiric website for the elder Pacio was arrested in court. After all, the political coverage of the torture against anti-fascist protesters and the complete police insecurity with regard to the violence against migrants, documented by numerous reports from international organizations, show that our country is neither Iran nor Turkey, but I don’t know if that is enough for us. When one sees the minister cutting the broadcast of the journalist who asked what was finally that lawsuit against Gardyan, he cannot fundamentally maintain any faith in the institutions, and this fatally weakens the arguments for the institutional absorption of the protest and potentially leads to acts of self-justice, whether we “condemn violence” or not. The peak of such criticism is not to justify armed violence. But it is to be understood that what Kalyris noblely calls “the weaknesses of our democracy” means troubled lives, much heavier than the average daily reader can imagine, more shocked by graffiti and copying at the university than by police barbarity. In short, the argument of Couponina is in principle right: the philosophy of the monopoly of legal violence has meaning to the extent that this violence is bound by legality.
3818	35	Are we currently living in conditions where state violence is not bound by law, to the extent that we can justify the appeal to armed response? My concern is, however, that those who are intentionally cut off for the reduction of violence, should see that if justice is smiled even more by serving the political purposes of our policy’s increasingly authoritarian turn, I really don’t know what we’ll have to answer to anyone who tells us that he considers the appeal to this ugly joke.

3818	43	and U. by Minhoff
3818	45	The decisive issue of effectiveness, which returns to the debate on terrorism, was already formulated by Clausevich. It is the incapacity to root the goals of the struggle in the popular masses, which forever prevents the realization of the dream that the opponent (the government) eventually collapses under the persistence of the attacks. Couponin returns to the loss of contact with the masses, and is the only point for which a self-criticism is formulated. The 17N would combine armed and mass action (73), the armed movement would be the pioneer of the movement (116), the follow-up of the EAM (119). He referred to the political disagreements and conflicts that occurred within the organization, saying that he believed that “the 17N should transform the current of sympathy that it has born and will create by its action into a real material force; that it needs a “prosta” that will capitalize the fruits of the armed propaganda of the “back”, the armed mechanism; that one part, of the (one) political action is a prerequisite for the success and development of the other” (212). Every time she returns to this subject by saying that the organization “ignored its political role” (269), it undermined the communication with the popular movement (220) and was unable to become a firefighter of the class struggle (257). 385, 398, 471, 473, 474 and 385, 398, 471, 473, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 474, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 471, 47 He sees, in a short word, as a bad handling something that is the fundamental and historically unbeatable outcome of terrorism. The discussion held in Italy summarizes on a historical level of experience the theoretical formulation of Clausevich (and many others). In the collection of texts published in Greek with the general title Autocritic of the rebellion returns a reflection on the separation of the rebels from the mass movement, which in fact does not progress rope from the discourse that had already been revealed with the first time the propaganda of the act was applied on an ambitious scale, with the assassination of the tsar Alexander in Russia. The people regretted the Tsar, betraying the dreams of the revolutionaries who thought this would trigger a generalized revolution against the Tsar regime. The discontinuity that Couponin faces as if it was a bad handling, which could have been avoided if otherwise balances and dialogue had been formed within the organization, is merely the political limit of terrorism. The path from the political vision to the increasingly closed intrusion, to the militarist organization that dissolves the world and confirms in the conscience of many the necessary imposition of the state, is a common path.
3818	47	As long as we leave the Marxist start-up 17N and approach the zero-inspired groups of the modern armed, the distance from the masses is no longer considered a weakness for which they must apologize, but a conscious and acceptable reality. They neglect the abandoned small bourgeois, they do not expect anything from them, and just the actors confirm their freedom. What the left armed action previously apologized, here has become clear: the masses are sleeping, the rebel acts for their behalf.
3818	49	We know the consequences of this very well, because it has been thoroughly studied over the past few years. The anti-terrorism policy – especially after September 11 – constitutes a whole field of investigation, the central point of which is that terrorism constitutes the ideal alibi to suppress what remains from democratic freedoms. The stable left criticism of terrorism is that it is a political violence, which achieves the opposite of the results sought, giving alibi to the state to legitimate in the social consciousness its repressive purposes.
3818	51	Conclusions
3818	53	After we have spent three decades in illegality and another one in prison, having done something that is limited and irreversible together, such as murder, we look forward to hearing what he thinks about it today. Couponin only regrets the distance from the masses, this is the only self-critic that he accepts for the action of the 17N.
3818	55	Murder is always an act of barbarism, against which the man who is not bloodshed stands with anger and reverse. But the question is what happens not when he suddenly decides to shoot a random passenger in the crowd, but to respond to an already existing barbarity. The holiness of human life does not seem to me sufficient reason to reject the armed struggle. However, even if the guilt of the victims can be discussed, it does not justify the murder. On the last two arguments, justice and massivity, I would like to stand more. As long as just institutions are fighting against the weak, our arguments against self-righteousness will always be undermined. As far as we turn off violence, there cannot be an effective opposition to self-righteousness, as long as justice ironises the oppressed and closes the eyes to the powerful, as the oppressive mechanisms of lawful violence defend established injustice.
3818	57	As for the latter question, the permanent success of his self-critical armed, the only one that Quifondin has shared and that has the entire book and occupies a dominant position on his final pages, the isolation from the masses: This is not an internal question of the balances or choices of the 17N. This is the only way something can change. That is why, when the state speaks of “terrorism”, it has not only a dragon of armed people, but what it is mostly afraid, that is, the mass action against the interests of the few. The anti-terrorist reason concerns supposedly armed struggle, but in practice it concerns every struggle. The strengthening of the state speech and the intrusion of the doctrine of order and security means that political movements that are not armed at all, but simply resist the letter of an unjust law, will be suppressed. The terrorism of the type we are discussing, not generally and unrighteously the violence of the rebels, but the conspiracy of closed eight-party groups, has nothing to offer politically in this regard, except to legalize the state oppression against every act of rebellion. And when one puts his hands with blood, as the revolutionaries have been forced to do at cost in many moments of history, there should be reasons not to be questionable: not only to resist the weight, but not to do otherwise. When in the declaration entitled “Manifest of ’92” it is stated that “the success of the 17N is only its existence” (406), we realize that this reason, of the man who feels right and only acts, desert of politics, has already separated his position from any revolutionary vision, and is a psychological narrative of the members of the organization. It remembers the pleasant report of the Anarchist Workers’ Association of Athens, in 1900: “Our companion Andrei Theodoridis, to celebrate his marriage with his companion Angelica Drosopoulos, tries on their marriage day to execute two famous Tocolphs of Patras.” The practice is described approximately as a secular fact, regardless of consequences and ethics.
3818	59	The discussion on the book of Kufonidina took place in the staring of the attempt to identify Syriza with terrorism, through the proverb, and the political debate to be limited to the drama of the relatives of the people who were murdered. This clearly shows exactly what the anti-terrorist reason is. Our efforts, I believe, should be directed to carefully discussing where the outskirts of armed action are identified, demonstrating the hypocritic condemnation of violence and the use of terrorism or “terrorism” as a means of advertising the need for further oppression. A world without violence would be better. The unilateral and hypocritic condemnation of violence only by one side does not contribute to this direction.

3819	31	The news
382	1	“Pyrinos” George Romanos: “The story with Antonov is dirty. How does an airplane, a moving bomb enter and “explode” outside of the Cavala?
382	3	“48 years the Cyprus file is closed. Speaking to Focus FM 103.6 and Stefan Damianidis the writer and historian researcher, George Romanos.”48 years are many. There is great pain, great heroism of Greek soldiers and great betrayal.”
382	5	“Russia knows very well what it does, it has not declared war. They are doing special. That America promotes this conflict is a crime. This crime has spread to the energy sector and is now kneeling both America and Europe.”
382	7	Mr. Romanos talked about the long-term agreement on joint flights to the International Space Station, signed by Roskosmos and NASA.
382	9	“They will continue to cooperate, Don’t go away, at the moment Russian gas is passing through Ukraine. “Who are they cheating?”
382	11	“The story with Antonov is dirty. An enormous aircraft, which carries 20 tons of cargo, filled with dangerous ammunition, enters a land of wines and “scrolls” out of Cavala. It is normal? and from where do we know that it has happened? the foreign minister had to resign, but who has a charity for resignation? how does a plane, a moving bomb, go in and “shake” out of Kavala? if, as they told us, it had a normal gun, there is not such a big explosion. In less than 4 hours this aircraft captured 4 critical destinations. In Sarajevo, Ankara, Nice, and Belgrade. And he wanted to go to Amman. All of this is “praktiking”.
382	13	“Those who are guilty in the history of coronavirus should be in prison. But in which country, with what justice? who knows the monocratic prime minister? it is clear that their efforts worldwide, does not convince.
3820	1	Ukrainians want weapons, not advice 
3820	3	Ukrainians want weapons, not advice
3820	5	The climate in the EU is tired. It has become negative to the fighting Ukraine. The voices of compromise with Russia are heard stronger, i.e. the voices calling on the Ukrainians to deliver by signing part of their territories.
3820	7	Macron was clear from Romania. “Ukraine will have to negotiate with Russia.” The concern is not in the content of the statement. It is clear that “Ukraine will have to negotiate with Russia at some point.” The worries are that today, while the battles are over, a leader at Macron level is unable to talk about negotiations. Today, what comes from is the provision of military assistance to Ukraine, beyond everything else and for another reason. In the negotiations that will be held “on a moment” Ukraine should not come as a sheep on massacre. He has achieved successes in the fields of struggle that will make him an equal interlocutor with the other side. But to do this, the Ukrainian army needs weapons.
3820	9	I am very afraid that Macron’s visit to Ukraine will not have a positive progress. If the French president repeats this position in front of Zelensky, while he will ask for military help, it is logical that the Ukrainian leader explodes publicly. In such hours, the real political and the so-called “logic voices” sound crazy.
3820	11	Unlike the leaders of older Europe, the U.S. elites in their majority captured the essence of the problem. Who is this?
3820	13	The invader at the end cannot be the winner. Losses in the field of fighting and the consequences of financial sanctions should create a negative balance for him. Russia, due to its weakness and small size of its economy, is unbearable to long-term sanctions.
3820	15	It seems that the United States, unlike some European leaders, will not accept after the war as their interlocutor. by Putin. They will not be forgiven for the invasion or the war crimes committed and committed by his army.
3820	17	This difference in the strategic vision of the Ukrainian war explains why the EU. He will never appear as a central player on the world stage. A collectivity of states that is lost in the trees and cannot see the forest, is condemned by history itself. And the trees in this case are the price of gas and oil, the primary surplus and the profits of the German industry. The forest is the next step of Putin’s Russia. Who will be his next victim?
3820	19	and g. I don’t think Macron, if there’s any “conflict” with Turkey, will tell us that we should negotiate!

3821	27	The result is counting...
3821	29	...
3821	31	So I saw Cyrus Mishotakis in his own world,
3821	33	I’ve been in a dream regime – for a young time.
3821	35	where Napoleonism and Ludo-Bicism are united,
3821	37	I thought that this hereditary unfair prime minister had preached
3821	39	where – if we analyze the core of them – they constitute a political disorder;
3821	41	This is a phenomenon described by the Chinese proverb.

3821	71	Without a doubt, three extremely important meetings, but they have a heavy shade...
3821	73	The American Society has been in a new shock since Sunday.
3821	75	After the new “blind” racist attack that left behind 10 dead and 3 injured.
3821	77	A 18 year old extreme-right spell, a slated white spell,
3821	79	He attacked with a weapon of uncertain people.
3821	81	Only because they were disturbed by the different color of their skin.
3821	83	When I saw the Greek Prime Minister hanging on the side of the American President.
3821	85	I am pleased to say goodbye for his upcoming contacts with the two powerful ladies.
3821	87	It appeared spontaneously in my mind the immaculate question.
3821	89	“Curriculum of Mishotaki,
3821	91	You don’t talk to Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Kamala Harris.
3821	93	“To the Danny Pearl?”
3821	95	On 10 April 2011, the then deputy of the extreme right form “LA.O.S.”,
3821	97	This is the following racist argument:
3821	99	“You hear me how the ‘immigration’ can be resolved.
3821	101	In my opinion, migration can be resolved in two ways.
3821	103	Those that should be clearly stated.
3821	105	The first way is to keep the borders, to understand what we mean... Border protection cannot exist if there are no losses.
3821	107	And to be understood,
3821	109	(the protection of the borders cannot exist) if there are no dead.
3821	111	...
3821	113	(The bloodshed of the word,
3821	115	It is interrupted by exciting praises.
3821	117	and the jealousy of his hearing;
3821	119	the epiphemia acts as an anabolic for the Pearl,
3821	121	He continues with his bloodshed.
3821	123	...
3821	125	The prison is dead.
3821	127	First of all this.
3821	129	And secondly, those who are here will have the “Logic of Motivations.”
3821	131	I don't believe so much in Dublin.
3821	133	(It means the Dublin Rules,

3821	139	Islam will come, it will enter more, it will dive the innerland of Europe.
3821	141	It will be drowned in Greece.
3821	143	The issue is to cut them off. Let them not come.
3821	145	Therefore, when you are here beyond, you will not have social benefits.
3821	147	You will not be able to eat, you will not be able to drink.
3821	149	You can’t go to the hospital.
3821	151	And you will tell others in Pakistan.
3821	153	“We are going worse here than in Pakistan.”
3821	155	If they do not go worse, they will come.
3821	157	They have to go worse.
3821	159	Their life, hell, will appear as a paradise in which they will live here beyond.
3821	161	and the funeral.”
3821	163	It is a terrible fact,
3821	165	that this misconception could be the ideological manifest.
3821	167	18 years of extreme right,
3821	169	for the scattered white color
3821	171	He was attacked with a weapon on uncertain people.
3821	173	Killing 10 and wounding 3
3821	175	Only because they were disturbed by the different color of their skin.
3821	177	And yet, Mr. Mishotakis, Joe Biden’s famous speaker,
3821	179	The Chamber Speaker of Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris,
3821	181	The triumph in the words and in the actions,
3821	183	He did not want to put Thano Pearry in his party, in his government,
3821	185	and – whose absence of empathy and intelligence – to assign him the Ministry of Health.
3821	187	Finally, what is the conclusion?
3821	189	The conclusion is one and only feeling: silence.
3821	191	Sadness for the power that the peoples give to worthless people.
3821	193	It is a regret for the institutionalization of impotence through the popular vote.
3821	195	It is a regret for a declining Greece that has chosen to be represented by Kyriakos Mitosotakis.
3821	197	I am regreting the narrow perception that the Medium voter expresses.
3821	199	He who is condemned to choose the same
3821	201	with the guide the fruit of his own hope:
3821	203	“If Mishotakis can go to the White House, I can.”
3821	205	and tragic.
3821	207	by Giorgio Mikhalas
3822	1	North Stream 1 is over. Scenario of tragedy for the discharge of natural gas from Russia – great poverty and social disadvantages are coming! Will Sri Lanka show the road to the countries of Europe?
3822	3	Horror scenarios with European cities being powered by the bill and for intense social disorders that will be caused by energy poverty are plunging into the states of the Old Continent as Putin's Moscow plays hard poker with the strawberry of gas supply with the mark date to be 11 July 2022.
3822	5	As tensions on Russia’s war in Ukraine are escalating, EU officials are afraid that the situation may worsen.
3822	7	Today, Russia closed its main pipeline to Germany, Nord Stream 1, for 10 days of scheduled maintenance.
3822	9	Many in Berlin – and throughout the EU – are afraid that it will never be opened again, and this feeds panic movements and fears of major social disorders and creates fears of the breakdown of social cohesion.
3822	11	in Greece
3822	13	The concern has been transferred to Southern Europe where governments do not exclude either a domain of electricity and gas interruptions in the event that Gazprom cuts the streams through the Nord Stream 1 to the central countries or closes the Turk Stream pipeline from which Greece is supplied.
3822	15	At the same time, in an interview with Bloomberg, the central bank of Greece, Yannis Sturnaras, despite rejecting the recession scenarios, pointed out that growth will be significantly affected by the possibility that Russian gas stores will close everywhere.
3822	17	The political risk of energy poverty
3822	19	In the event of a larger gas break, Germany and other Central European countries will suffer enormous economic damage which, in combination with the inflation pressure and the rise in borrowing costs, will lead to energy poverty, guaranteeing a serious political risk.
3822	21	According to the FT in their publication on Saturday 9 July, Germany is now moving forward to a hot water report, lowering the street lights and closing the swimming pools as the impact of the energy crisis begins to spread like the legendary Ice-Nine wave, from the industry to offices, recreation centers and houses.
3822	23	The reason behind Germany’s slow-moving paralysis is well known: the massive gas price rise caused by Russia’s move last month to sharply reduce supplies in Germany has immersed Europe’s largest economy in its worst energy crisis from the oil price shock in 1973 – as for the prevaints what the economy is experiencing is a massive supply shock.
3822	25	Risk for social cohesion
3822	27	With electricity prices reaching the highest levels ever, natural gas importers and joint ventures are struggling for survival, while consumer accounts are rising to disproportionate levels.
3822	29	“The situation is more than dramatic,” said Axel Gedaschko, head of the Federation of German Housing Companies GdW.
3822	31	“Social cohesion in Germany is in great danger.”
3822	33	The shock of the offer
3822	35	Referring to the famous day of July 22, when the Russian gas flows are expected to start again, Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid writes that “but we all spend most of our time on the market thinking about the Fed and the recession, I suspect that what happens with Russian gas is potentially an even greater story.
3822	37	Of course, until July 22 places may have been found and the offer may begin to normalize.
3822	39	Anyone who tells you that he knows what will happen here guess, but at least it should be a huge focus point for all markets.”
3822	41	The bank also warns that “if the gas cessation is not solved in the coming weeks, this will lead to an extension of the energy disruption with significant pre-effects on economic growth and, of course, much higher inflation.”
3822	43	The Failure of Europe – The Breakthrough for its Disintegration?
3822	45	Europe failed to give priority to energy security and is now found exposed and excessively dependent on Russian energy, so it is forced to pay high prices for energy.
3822	47	This is the great mistake it is called to face at a collective and individual level, which leads to fractures in its cohesion.
3822	49	France faces this issue by nationalizing its largest joint venture energy company in order to ensure survival through nuclear energy.
3822	51	Germany, which is undoubtedly the country that has suffered most from energy security failures, may soon have to save its largest joint ventures as well.
3822	53	In his today's statements on Sunday 10 July, French Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire said that Europe must be prepared for the full cessation of Russian gas supplies.
3822	55	“Let’s prepare for a complete cessation of Russian gas,” he said. Le Maire at an economic conference in Eix-en-Provance, southern France, on Sunday, July 10.
3822	57	“This is the most likely scenario today.”
3822	59	France needs to be careful about energy consumption, to create natural gas reserves, to reduce bureaucracy by slowing the development of renewable energy and to accelerate its program for the construction of new nuclear reactors.
3822	61	In this context, as already announced, France has turned to the EDF.
3823	1	We have not seen anything from Russia, China.
3823	3	The Brazilian journalist and geopolitical analyst, Pepe Escobar, lies the leaders of the West for how they handle the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and believes that Russia and China will strengthen their alliance against the West.
3823	5	“The abandoned Roman Emperors at least showed some degree of passion.
3823	7	Here we are faced with a toxic mix of humility, contradictory moderity, illusion, cruel ideological thought and unexplained absurdity – all the symptoms of a deep soul disease.
3823	9	Calling it West Biden – Leyen – Blinken or something like that would be too antagonistic: in the end, they are insignificant politicians who simply pavel orders.
3823	11	This is a historic process: physical, mental and moral cognitive degeneration, embedded in NATOstan’s manifest despair in the attempt to preserve Eurasia, allowing occasional tragic scenes like a NATO summit that declared war against almost the whole of the non-West,” he said.
3823	13	“You haven’t seen anything yet.”
3823	15	When President Putin turns to the collective West in front of Duma leaders and political party leaders, he feels like a comet to hit an immaculate planet.
3823	17	“Today we hear that they want to defeat us on the battlefield, well, what to say, let’s try.
3823	19	We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us until the last Ukraine – this is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people.
3823	21	But it seems that everything ends in that.
3823	23	Everyone must know that, in general, we have not actually started anything yet.”
3823	25	The fact. In Operation Z (Russian invasion of Ukraine), Russia uses a fraction of its military potential, resources and weapons of its latest technology,” Escobar explains.
3823	27	End of the United States World Order
3823	29	“We don’t deny the peace talks, but those who deny should know that the longer it lasts, the harder it will be for them to negotiate with us,” Putin said.
3823	31	Here is the undoubted basic extract, Escobar notes:
3823	33	“They should have understood that they have already lost from the beginning of our special military operation, because its beginning means the beginning of a radical collapse of the World Order, as the United States has formed it.
3823	35	This is the beginning of the transition from liberal-globalizing American egocentrism to a truly multipolar world – a world that is not based on egoistic rules invented by someone for themselves, behind which there is nothing but the desire for hegemony, not hypocritically double standards. But in international law, in the true sovereignty of peoples and cultures, in their will to live their historical fate, values and traditions and to build cooperation on the basis of democracy, justice and equality.
3823	37	And we must understand that this process can no longer be stopped,” Putin said.
3824	1	Nord Stream I closed: EU gas reserves “strain” without alternative power supply
3824	3	From today, the Nord Stream I pipeline is also typically out of operation to beined and the necessary tests are done but Brussels are afraid of what will happen after 21 July, which is scheduled for the end of the work.
3824	5	Because despite what the Western SMEs are spreading, the EU has not found any alternative food supplies and, as everything shows, it will not be found and the winter will be tragic.
3824	7	The number has decreased significantly after recent incidents in the U.S.
3824	9	Four European governments in Britain, France, Bulgaria and Germany (in September elections) have already been suspended due to accuracy.
3824	11	Restrictions on oil production as well as liquid LNG gas, in combination with price exposure, increase the risk of deficits that, in the event of a complete interruption, will lead to a compulsory limitation on consumption and a report on the distribution of natural gas.
3824	13	What will they offer to the Europeans? what is the “bad Putin” responsible? why is it responsible? because it is forbidden to export raw materials?
3824	15	And all this for the service of the American interests? because the European interest is not as it is proven by the result.
3824	17	To say it simply: European governments prefer their citizens to “make out of hunger” and freeze their “hearts” in the winter rather than admit that they made the greatest mistake of the other interests (in this case they supported the American interests) than the interests of the European peoples.
3824	19	It’s so great their obsession to distort the reality and to support their choice to “comfort” the food crisis that comes because of the non-exportation of Russian fertilizers, who support the narrative (as it is done in the Netherlands resulting in violent conflicts between farmers and police) that the large agricultural production and livestock are responsible for the climate change due to carbon dioxide production!
3824	21	The EU and Greece must fill their gas reserves by up to 80% of the annual consumption by 1 November, in order to ensure their energy efficiency for the winter period.
3824	23	With what happens, it seems impossible.
3824	25	Greece covers about 40% of Russia’s gas imports regardless of what the Greek government claims “on sufficiency”.
3824	27	Georgios Stasi, the chief executive of the ECONOMIST, predicted that in the event of a violent cessation of Russian gas, there will be a great turmoil in the market, which for Greece, would lead to a cessation of energy from the industry to cover domestic consumers.
3824	29	That if natural gas actually fails to meet domestic demand, then the burden from the industry will be reduced so that critical infrastructure and households will not be left without power.
3824	31	Since the state Gazprom limited gas flows in Germany by 60% in mid-June, prices have begun a new rise that doesn’t seem to have an end.
3824	33	In the middle of last week, the price on the Dutch exchange platform (TTF) climbed to €184 per megawatt, exceeding the price levels last March.
3824	35	These prices, which are directly reflected in the cost of electricity, also translate the ministry’s planning to determine the new electricity rates by suppliers by July 25, although the initial plan was expected to have been announced on July 10.
3824	37	However, the risk of announcing thraps over 50 minutes the kilowattora (today without subsidies is about 35 minutes), led to a new design.
3824	39	Natural gas covers 44,5% of the energy mixture in Greece, GDPs 25.1%, lithium below 10%, imports 8% and hydroelectric almost 6%.
3824	41	Therefore, additional state support is sought and greater budgetary space or otherwise the accounts will continue to be “astronomic” and in the end the citizens in each of their regulations to electricity suppliers per month will have to give... two wages, which is impossible for mathematical reasons...
3824	43	Those who pay electricity bills in recent months have come to despair as their income is not enough to pay them even if they don’t eat anything.
3824	45	“Things may be very bad in the next period, we can actually find ourselves in situations, especially in the gas that will be unprecedented for Greece,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitosotakis said a few days ago in the parliament and this even used it as one of the key arguments for not conducting premature elections (the polls were the main reason but this is not publicly discussed).
3824	47	Of course, no one will be able to pay that money.
3824	49	As for LNG, first it does not appear to be available by the Americans and second it is expensive.
3824	51	“The question that is now stressed by market factors is how long Greece, but also other countries in Europe, will be able to import LNG at the stratosphere prices that have been shaped,” asks the head of the Institute of Energy of Southeast Europe (IENE) Mr. Kostas Stabolis.
3824	53	As features note, if prices remain for a few more months above € 160 / MWh, there will necessarily be a rationalization in terms of the number of LNG loads that companies will be able to import without the risk of recording serious losses, as prices will explode to the heights. This concern was confirmed by Evangelos Mitilenios speaking at the same conference of the Economist.
3824	55	As he said, “Greece will not face a problem of energy sufficiency. The problem will be the prices and where the LNG will be found.” He also noted that the Greek market needs 40 to 45 loads of LNG to meet the annual needs in case of interruption and that Mitilenios has already closed 24 loads.
3824	57	He confirmed the nightmare forecasts if the flow of Russian gas will be stopped, as today only with the probability, the price already, is approaching 200 euros per megawatt, when before the crisis it was at 20 euros/MWh.
3824	59	According to the IFRS estimates, a possible complete cessation of the gas flow by Gazprom would equal to a loss of 50% of the annual consumption by June 2023.
3824	61	It is 38.7 terrasses that correspond to approximately 46 LNG ships by June 2023, of which 26 TWh are destined to supply Greece and the rest to support Bulgaria in the framework of European cooperation and solidarity.
3824	63	It should be noted that in June, the EU imported for the first time in its history more liquid LNG from the US than through natural gas pipelines from Russia.
3824	65	But, as we have said, U.S. LNG costs, and this in itself increases the cost in all other things.
3824	67	But even so, will there be sufficient amounts?
3824	69	Just a day after the announcement of the U.S. Cheniere Energy Inc., which is the leading U.S. LNG exporter, that it will be forced to close for a long time and will put the country’s commitment to increase the LNG supply yesterday came to light the news of the explosion in the building of the natural gas company Oneok in Medford, Oklahoma.
3824	71	It was necessary to evacuate the space not only from the employees in the company, but also to evacuate their homes and all the inhabitants in a radius of two miles from the factory.
3824	73	An explosion occurred at the U.S. LNG terminal in Freeport, Texas.
3824	75	The incident caused a rise in gas prices in Europe due to supply restrictions.
3824	77	How will the US then comply with its commitments to adequate EU supply?
3824	79	But in the U.S., the price of gas, on the contrary, dropped by 40%, Bloomberg noted. Because the cancellation of exports means that more gas will remain available for internal use.
3825	1	670 mouths closed
3825	3	The hunger strike continues by immigrants and refugees detained in the Corinth camp, with a basic request to stop the fear of an indefinite detention. The extension of the administrative detention after the legal maximum of 18 months shall be applied by order of the Ministry of Public Order, based on the opinion of the State’s Legal Council, which is controlled as contrary-constitutional. A ruling of the Administrative First Court of Athens has deemed the detention of more than 18 months illegal, while other court decisions are expected after appeals by lawyers.
3825	5	The hunger strike began on Monday and the 670 immigrants detained in Corinto, leaving the shelter. Yesterday they were visited by a Syriza delegation, consisting of the members of the Parliament Royal Katrivanu and Kosta Sakharia, lawyers, members of the Department of Justice, the local Syriza and the Anti-Racist Initiative Corinth. According to the police, the withdrawal continues by about 200 people, but almost all of the migrants who communicated with the delegation said they were hunger strikes.
3825	7	Prejudice
3825	9	They welcomed the visitors with the detention papers in hand, asking with anxiety to find out how long their testimony will be extended. “They tell us we’ll stay here forever if we don’t sign for a deportation,” migrants from Algeria told the group members, and they admitted that even those who sign a voluntary deportation are still detained for months.
3825	11	In despair are the 152 migrants who have completed the 18 months, of which 40 have been transferred to Amigdalesa, with the official reason for the registration of the asylum application. There is no asylum office in Corinth, so the requests of those who claim to seek asylum are not recorded. It operates, however, the Office of the International Organization for Migration, to facilitate voluntary departure.
3825	13	The capacity of the camp is up to 891 people and will rise to 1,600 when the new wings built by the ACTOR (related BOBOLA) are completed. Migrants are held in rooms of 12 persons, with cocktails stumbled one by another, as the minimum free space is usually occupied by a self-designed prayer space. One of the biggest problems, in addition to the barbarity of permanent closure, is the bad hygiene conditions, with lack of personal items and cleansers.
3825	15	Patients with severe diseases stay for months without medications – typically the ECHR has taken care, the contract has not been completed and the medications are purchased from police funds with delay. A hospital has been created, which is inactive, since there are no elementary infrastructure. But there’s a surgeon – but there’s no breathing mask – and a gynecologist for the only male population!
3825	17	The only drugs that are given relatively easily are psycho drugs. Three Syrian refugees are detained in the camp for expulsion after sentence for crimes, a refugee from Eritrea and an Iranian journalist, while six minors were transferred to prisons in Lutrakis. Two Pakistani migrants who were detained for 17 months had cut their mouths - they were able to get the raps out only in the morning before the visit.
3825	19	As camp psychologists and police officers admitted, the cases of anxiety and depression were launched when the detention was announced to be extended by more than 18 months. The immigrants reacted with screams, screams, knocking the head on the wall, while hunger strike was the first group protest in an unfair and unfair decision.
3825	21	- In solidarity concentration and march outside the Corinth camp calls the Open Initiative Against the Arrest Centres on Sunday 15 June. The buses depart at 10.30 from the Archaeological Museum and return from Corinto at 17.00.
3826	1	Mothers and Mothers against Roma
3826	3	A double interference from the MATs with the accompanying prosecutor and the City Council took place yesterday morning in the Roma camp in the Monetary District, in Halandri. During the expulsion, investigations were conducted on any irregularities, but what has a special interest is the identification of persons and the registration of houses that were made in order to determine who and how many live in the camp.
3826	5	“The state has just today gained a comprehensive picture of how many people stay there, which cancells all decisions on demolition and relocation,” says Panagiot Dimitras, a legal representative of the EPSE and a authorized representative of the Roma Association “Hope.”
3826	7	We remember that G. Decentralized Attic Administration, Dimitris Kalogereopoulos, has issued a decision to demolish the camp on February 25, 2014 and to relocate the Roms of Halandrio to Mount Father. However, the process has broken down, as the mayor, both of the Megarerians and Mandras, strongly react to the possible transfer, with the mayor of the Megarerians already appealed legally against the decision to move the Roma Hallandria.
3826	9	Decisions on the demolition of houses are based on the protocol with file number 3083/96, according to which in the camp there are 43 houses owned by 38 owners. Since then, only 45% of the owners and 44% of the houses are currently in the camp in the “Citizen Palace”, which raises questions about which houses are legally to be destroyed, while the immediate release of a new protocol is considered compulsory.
3826	11	Mr. Dimitras emphasizes that, on the part of the Secretary-General of the Decentralized Attic Administration, the adoption of the decree of dismantling is a violation of international justice, as UN security measures are in force since May last year.
3826	13	Stelius Kalamiotis, chairman of the Roma Association “Hope”, denounced the police action yesterday as “fascist and absolutely wrong.” The attack took place at 8:00 a.m., when the children went to school, resulting in them being scared. “It’s an act of abuse, racist and illegal,” Demetras, in turn, denounces to the “F.S.N.”, and continues saying that: “The sudden entry into a camp where its inhabitants have not been found guilty in the past, except for a case of reumatous kidnapping, is made to remind them that everyone is guilty in advance, only because they are Zyngans.”
3827	1	“Frazy and... stupidity” 
3827	3	Last night, in the 700-reader’s “Eve” newspaper, a woman writer wrote an article entitled “Fraules and Blood in Polytechnic” referring to the events that occurred at Columbia University in April 1968, during the student rebellion. (This is the ironic title of my article.) Obviously, the artographer compares what was played in the Student Centre of Photographers with what was done at the time at the University of Columbia. They don’t wonder why the “August” only sells 700 leaves. And it is a lot!
3827	5	The article, which was written by a woman, I repeat it, addresses with an irony the woman police officer who was attacked by a narcotic trafficker, an irony with strongly the element of sexism. Obviously, the writer behind the security of her computer is unable to perceive the risks faced by other women who, for 800 euros, struggle for our own and its own quietness.
3827	7	It is clear that in the whole text there is no word about capturing a whole floor of the student center by non-university students with violating common criminal law behaviors. So what remains is the invasion of the ELAS, the shootings and the disasters caused by the police operation.
3827	9	"Therefore, the articlebook of the “Eyes” is reasonably questioned: “What will follow? arrests, exile, torture and tanks? shame, shame, because a few years ago we had a democracy. Now we have not. We have a parliamentary dictatorship."" reason misleading, thought simple, no contact with reality, as the lady has built her own reality and refer to it and denounces it."
3827	11	In the same wavelength and the gentlemen Janakopoulos and Springs. They denounce ELAS, without any mention of why the operation was made. Obviously, they think it is normal in a student house that a whole floor has been converted into a drug trafficking staircase by people involved in kidnapping and rape. Let Mr. Janakopoulos ask his brother who teaches in Oxford if such things happen there.
3827	13	Syriza has not yet understood that with these policies they are dismissed by the citizens who are forced to cooperate, if they want to re-govern. When the “Early” newspaper, the gentlemen Janakopoulos and Springs support the crying illegality, then the New Republic can sleep quietly. He has found his sponsors.
3827	15	I will not theoretically document the aliveries of the Radical Left with some criminals, nor how and when it started. The only one I regret for this cover that some Syriza officers offer to them is A. Tsipras who tries to approach the gentlemen—Pandeladas and the horrible mountains, the old and the young, who try to fill the stall — I put the heart, but every kind of Janakupuli with a cloth empty it.
3828	1	One of the Syriza who saw push forward 
3828	3	The days pass and only the NGO HumanRights360 was forced to apologize for the fake story of the dead little Mary and the sheltered refugees in the sandstone on the Euro. The lies that various valid journalists and foreign media have built and trapped Greece.
3828	5	Both Spiegel and Channel 4, which broadcast in live and false news, did not go to correction. The Greek journalist of the German media who had suggested that he would have a new report is “canned.” The colleague Royal Swift, who confirmed in the site report that a dead girl is not there, but is alive, is threatened by unknown. Syriza does not “apologize” though he has exhausted all the margins of oppositional use of fake history to hit the government.
3828	7	But one in Syriza saw the light of the truth!
3828	9	He speaks of the Turkish push forward of refugees and migrants by the Turkish authorities, of the EU’s tolerance to Erdogan’s dirty games, and calls for a stop to “the criticism of the region’s deer, Tayyip Erdogan.”
3828	11	It has a special burden, that this person is the eurodeputate Kosta Arvanitis who in the first phase not only had adopted the whole story made with the “make-up” girl, but together with the second eurodeputate Stelio Kullou had filed an urgent question to the Commission.
3828	13	“A five-year-old girl has died from a snorkeling on the island and her mother keeps her body in the river water to slow the snorkeling, while another 9-year-old girl is in critical condition and among the arrested there are three pregnant women and several who need urgent medical assistance,” they wrote and asked the Commission to answer if Frontex would intervene in order to dismantle the refugee group, get the necessary humanitarian protection and medical care and ensure conditions suitable for the 5-year-old girl.
3828	15	They also asked what the Commission would do to end, “in violation of any international legitimacy and fundamental rights, the practice of pushbacks on the ground and sea border Greece-Turkey that continues despite the international torture.”
3828	17	A month later, the European Parliament, alone this time, calls on the European Commission to take a public position on the mechanization of refugees and pushforwards by the Erdogan regime.
3828	19	Although it is unprecedented for Syriza’s staff to say publicly – and even with a question to the European Parliament – that Turkey is pushing forward without night for Greek pushbacks, however, the question is not so innocent.
3828	21	He asks the Commission to answer whether Turkey can now be considered a safe third country, if such extensive forced movements of refugee groups to the EU border, i.e. to the sea and land borders of our country are found.
3828	23	It does not ignore, of course, that the foundation of the EU-Erdogan refugee agreement is the recognition of Turkey as a safe third country. He also remembers that the agreement was signed by Alexis Tsipras who then called on the EU to fulfil its commitments to Turkey: financial assistance and visa release for Turkish citizens.
3829	1	The report was completed in the Inspectorate for Observations - Androulaksis: Double scandal the case
3829	3	The report was completed in the Inspectorate for Observations - Androulaksis: Double scandal the case
3829	5	Opposition parties demanded methodologies to close the investigation process.
3829	7	The final titles fell on Friday in the Investigation Committee for the observations with the deposit of Nico Andrulaqis to close the list of witnesses. The refusal of the majority to call new witnesses has caused the reaction of the opposition parties. “The statement of the president of PASOK-KINAL Nikou Androlaki did not offer anything substantial to the work of the Investigative Committee,” the NGO of the Netherlands commented at the end of the procedure.
3829	9	“A report full of irrisorologies, without any specific element or answers to the key questions that were asked to him,” he noted characteristically, commenting on Mr. Androlaki’s report to the parliament’s investigative committee.
3829	11	As the majority points out, the president of PASOK refused to take a position on the critical question whether the country’s political personnel should be excluded from the observations, while he agreed with SYRIZA in the case Pichorla, decreasing it. The NGO also emphasized Mr. Androulaki’s tactics to choose the questions he wants to answer, undermining the parliamentary institution.
3829	13	The sources of PASOK noted that “there is no barrier in the capture of the New Republic”, while according to information, the president of PASOK-KINAL, registered personal responsibilities to Kyriako Mitosotaki. “Who is the Greek who thinks he didn’t know the prime minister?” commented characteristic partners of Nico Androlaki.
3829	15	Syriza, in a statement, denounced “the government’s method of closing the investigation committee, as they note, despite the disclosures and publications that prove that Stamatis Tribalis is KRIKEL’s manager, has failed to the Commission.”
3829	17	In their statement they add, “Today is a shame day for the Greek Parliament and the Republic, but the issue does not close here. The Institutions and Transparency Committee, where all stakeholders, visible and invisible, as well as the political persons involved, will be called to provide explanations. As far as the government wants to close the scandal of fraud, which is an open wound for the Republic, the responsible will be liable to the Justice, either before or after the elections.”
3829	19	The KKE, in its statement, notes, among other things, that it is a “closure-couch of the investigation committee, with the responsibility of the government’s majority.”
3829	21	Androulaki: “Double Scandal” the case of the assassinations
3829	23	In his statement, the President of PASOK directly attacked the Prime Minister and the government, saying that his monitoring concerned political reasons and not national security. Without hiding his disappointment for the course of the Investigation, he called on the members of the committee that they have not called all the persons involved and ask the victim for repairs.
3829	25	He appeared to repeat his request and asked to submit all those involved in the case. As he said, “I put each one of you before his political responsibilities. “Take your responsibilities and call all the dark persons that lead the country to medieval situations.”
3829	27	“I will receive information at any time – but only legally and in writing. The government is entirely unreliable for any oral conversation,” Mr. Andrulaqis noted, adding that the government says “all in the light” but is hiding behind the law that was proposed and prohibits the ADAE to inform the observed. He also gave up the headline, noting that
3829	29	Insisting in the view that his follow-up was for political reasons, he was wondered why, after the recommended reasons, his follow-up did not continue and after his election. He said, “My file was destroyed, because if there were, they would have to say what they found and continued my illegal monitoring. If there was a cause of national security, you would have done it a lot to break down the PASOK. There is no reason for national security, but a reason for national security.” In fact, he said that “my monitoring by the EIP was a radiography of all of our members.”
3829	31	According to information, during his deposit, with special emotional load, he emphasized that the issue of national risk has hit him as a Greek patriot. Shame, shame and shame. I have been struggling in Europe and outside Europe for national interests. I work for my homeland at night. Some of us are not tourists in Brussels,” he said, adding that “it’s unpleasant for the scenarios to involve foreign ambassades,” while he called on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to put a barrier on these scenarios.
3829	33	Referring to escapes about his family and his personal life, Mr. Andrulaqis emphasized that “I am neither myself nor my family stunned from the bad rumors, which circulate specific propaganda mechanisms. I am here to face everything in the light of the day and not in the dark. I am not afraid of anything. Clean heaven, lightning is not afraid.”
3829	35	After the examination of the witnesses is completed, the work of the committee will be completed by the submission of the final conclusion of the committee.

3829	71	After the examination of the witnesses is completed, the work of the committee will be completed by the submission of the final conclusion of the committee.
383	1	This is propaganda.
383	3	"The ""Jungla"" posted early in the afternoon of Monday a video uploaded to Twitter, apparently by some Ukrainian fighters, possibly fanatic activists. The video captures a lot of hard images. Two Ukrainians shoot in cold three Russian prisoners. They were shot at the foot with Kalashnikov. These people are excluded from walking again in their lives if they survive the bleeding apparently caused by almost-contact shootings. This is another proof of how in the war of Ukraine the thing has escaped from the beginning. We are watching scenes of wild violence as the lens had recorded many years ago in Yugoslavia. Scenes that we described as unprecedented and are now repeated in Ukraine."
383	5	This video as it is natural has caused anger in Moscow and disgrace in Kiev. Until now, the Ukrainian authorities have not denied the unprecedented violent incident.
383	7	Every citizen of this country would expect and logically how this video should have been posted from every Greek news site and would have been broadcast by all the television stations just as it is and should happen with every barbarity recorded in this war.
383	9	However, except for small exceptions, the well-known Greek media refused to deal with the video in question. Obviously because - it is a screaming breach of any rule, any written or unwritten law. You do not torture with such a coolness the prisoners, unless you deeply neglect every side, every element of human life. Only the bloodshed Nazis, the Franco fascists in the Spanish citizenship and the human waste of the Japanese imperial army are competing worthy of such barbarism.
383	11	Obviously, all of this is not enough for those Greek SMEs who are placed on an ordered service by writing orders. The story, however, is not written by sequences of “black holes” and “dark matter”. It is written with facts, magnetic material, photos and sounds. Thus comes the human death of Srebrenica, or the tragedy of the market of Sarajevo, the centuries of Bukobar, and now all that human barbarism records on the fronts of Ukraine. But we said. Some are and will always be in ordered service. 
3830	1	Polakis publicly finds a trade unionist doctor: 'You are a complex and ideological flock' - Discomfort in Kumunduru
3830	3	"After his provocative positions on a post by the accompanying professor of public health Theodore Litra, where he once again ""hunted"" the anti-vaccinators, Syriza deputy Paul Polakis responded in an inappropriate way to a post by the neurochirurgist, a trade unionist active physician on Twitter and Director of the General Hospital of Nice-Pirea, Panu Papancolau, who accused Syriza of ""diplomation"" on the issue of vaccines."
3830	5	Specifically, Mr. Papancolau left heights that Syriza’s dubious attitude towards the issue of the effectiveness of the vaccines is reasonable, with tolerance of Alexis Tsipras, as the official opposition party does not want “to give the lies to the right”.
3830	7	Syriza’s deputy not delayed to answer, and accused Mr. Papanycolau of “washing out” Thano Pluri and Mina Gaga, while he did not fail to succeed and personally against him, describing the deep “complex and unwritten ideological fleet”!
3830	9	Antibacterial response to Litra
3830	11	It is recalled that Paul Polakis, in a challenging position under the post of Professor Theodore Litra for his investigation on the MRIs and the dead from coronavirus, once again caught the anti-vaccinators, and wondered why someone should be seriously sick after he has already been vaccinated, because the vaccine “is terribly effective to prevent from the serious disease.”
3830	13	“It didn’t succeed, it didn’t succeed,” said Mr. Polakis.
3830	15	Mr. Lithras didn’t leave the intervention of Mr. Polakis unanswered, reminding that the vaccine’s role is to protect those suffering from the severe disease, and that even if some have severe symptoms, the vaccinated deaths are much less than the non-vaccinated.
3830	17	Discomfort in the Kumunduru, empty from Blond
3830	19	P. Polakiy’s attitude once again brought Syriza into a position of apologizing, while the government came into a difficult position after the publication of the second part of the study by professors Litra and Ciodra on the mortality of displaced within and outside of the MET.
3830	21	The Daily talks about discomfort at the upper stages of Kumunduru, which was not officially expressed by the parliamentary group’s leadership.
3830	23	"But sound was the vacation by his co-patriot in Crete and former ""customer"" in the leadership of the Ministry of Health Andrea Xantho."
3830	25	Mr. Xanthos was challenged by the Minister of Health Thano Pluri who, by his intervention in the Parliament’s Committee on Social Affairs, called on SYRIZA to be placed for Mr. Polaki’s online confrontation with Professor Theodoro Litra regarding the real conclusions of the second study.
3830	27	“The vaccines were protected from heavy intelligence. Those who suffered seriously are unvaccinated. This is what Mr. Luther says. Here you will get the position of Mr. Syriza. Because Mr. Polakis comes and tells Mr. Litra that the mass scientific histeria had no sense to vaccinate these ages. Say it straight. Is this Syriza’s position?” said Mr. Peyris, addressing the opposition officials. Reacting, Mr. Blonde cried out from the seat, “No! This is not the position of Syriza. I have said it a thousand times.”
3831	1	What Erdogan hides and what he seeks: Phillip and Driva’s analysis of Ankara’s strategy
3831	3	What is Erdogan looking for? he wants a “heat episode” to bring us to the facts? he tries to rewrite the Lozan Treaty? to these questions by Nico Hadzhenikolau they answered speaking in the central news release of ANT1, the counter-general e.a. and former NATO commander, Christos Drivas and the professor and analyst of international matters of the ANT1, Constantine Phillies.
3831	5	As everything shows, Ankara is causing on a daily basis by insisting on the burning rhetoric against Greece, trying in this way to lead things to uncontrolled situations.
3831	7	“Erdogan seeks to create new achievements, now questioning the Lozan Treaty, wanting to review it. It really seeks a hot episode, but that starts by us and not by him,” said Christos Drivas, vice-general.
3831	9	“In my assessment, Erdogan’s first goal is Castelorois and then to reach the 25th of May, so we have rejection and unacceptable statements in the framework of influence operations in order to pass the master messages to the global community, which are secondally addressed to the Greek population and primarily desire to raise the awareness of the Turks.”
3831	11	The posture of Stoldenberg.
3831	13	Mr. Drivas said that Greece is in the best possible situation from the side of the allies and the U.S. which is our main ally, while at the same time he expressed many questions about Mr. G.’s attitude. NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, calls it the “defeat.”
3831	15	He also emphasized that Mr. Stoltenberg uses a particular doctrine, which has as the basic principle that the Alliance does not interfere with the personal problems of the Member States. “He tries to follow this line but does not do it well. “It uses the language of diplomacy in a crazy way, NATO doesn’t want to lose Turkey, not Erdogan,” Mr. Drivas said.
3831	17	“Erdogan will not try a hot event like in the Imias.”
3831	19	"“It’s obvious that Turkey, which has made the Lozan Treaty ‘sharp’ in various points, not only in the Egean region, wants its revision. However, I don’t think that he would like to succeed through a hot episode, if we can define it in the form that happened in the Imias in 1996, because if he wanted to do that, he would have already tried it. The international environment does not allow this,"" the analyst of international issues of the ANT1 said."

3832	1	Ukraine calls for NATO membership – Russia “with the finger” in nuclear power
3832	3	Ukraine has submitted an application for accession to NATO with urgent procedures in response to the announcement of the integration of the four Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine in Russia.
3832	5	This was stated by Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky in a video-screen message earlier.
3832	7	This is a move of maximum escalation from Kiev as if this request is accepted, an attack on the rest of Ukraine controlled by Kiev will be considered an attack on the NATO, under Article 5 on collective defence.
3832	9	As well as the attack of Kiev on the areas that entered the Russian territory will be considered by Russia as an attack of a NATO member state.
3832	11	As the Russian President has warned, Russia will use any means it has to protect the areas incorporated into it.
3832	13	The scene of global misery is steadily staying step by step and no one knows who or what will stop it.
3832	15	Seven months after the start of the operations in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin advanced the integration in Russia of the four former Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine, Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporiya and Herson, after the referendum took place.
3832	17	The magnetic message of V. Zelensky:
3832	19	As he said:
3832	21	“We have already reached NATO.
3832	23	We have already demonstrated compliance with the standards of the Alliance. They are real for Ukraine – real in the field of battle and in all aspects of our interaction.
3832	25	We trust each other, help each other and protect each other. This is Alliance.
3832	27	Today we take our decisive step by signing the application of Ukraine to join NATO in a faster way.”

3833	1	Neoliberal “antidot” on inflation: ECB’s new – large – interest rise
3833	3	The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched a major interest rate increase today (27/10/22) with the aim of reducing uncontrolled inflation.
3833	5	The 25th Board of Directors of the ECB raised reference interest rates by three-quarters of the percentage point (0.75%), following the record increase last month and following the example of the Federal Bank of the United States.
3833	7	Thus, the basic interest rate is 2% (from 1.25%), the limit funding interest rate to 2.25% (from 1.50%) and the deposit interest rate to 1.50% (from 0.75% earlier).
3833	9	This means that the interest rates in the euro area will rise by two percentage points within three months. It marked the fastest interest rate rise in the history of the euro and raises questions about how far the ECB is planning to reach under the threat of recession.
3833	11	It is characteristic that an increase in this size had been made between 18 months in the 2005-2007 period and 17 months in the 1999-2000 period.
3833	13	“Inflation remains very high and will remain above our goal for a long time,” ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters. The bank’s policy makers “seek to further raise the interest rates to ensure the timely return of inflation” to the 2% target, he explained.
3833	15	Lagarde said the interest rate continues to rise, despite the fact that the bank is expecting “more weakening in the rest of this year and early next year.”
3833	17	At the same time, the Board of Directors, on its today’s meeting, decided to move forward to the first steps to reduce the ECB’s balance sheet, which after the quantitative relaxation and cheap liquidity programmes implemented in recent years has exceeded 8.8 trillion. the euro.
3833	19	Central banks around the world are drastically raising interest rates that determine the credit costs for and consumers. Their objective is to stop the covering inflation powered by the high energy prices, the supply chain problems after the pandemic and the revival of the demand for goods and services after the relief of the restrictions on COVID-19.
3833	21	In the US, the Fed increased its interest rates by 0.75% for the third consecutive time last month.
3833	23	Increase per quarter was usually the rule for central banks. But this happened before inflation rose to 9.9% in the Eurozone, powered by the highest prices of gas and electricity after the cessation of gas supply from Russia during the war in Ukraine.
3833	25	Inflation in the U.S. is close to the 40-year high of 8.2%, partly fueled by stronger growth and most pandemic support costs than in Europe.
3833	27	Some analysts forecast a half-point increase in the last year’s interest rate meeting in December and believe that the bank could stop after that.
3833	29	The ECB predicts inflation to fall to 2.3% by the end of 2024.
3834	1	28th October - Thessaloniki: Marder and Rafale fighters are removed - see videos and photos
3834	3	In the sky of Thessaloniki and the historic Spitfire MJ755 together with a F-16 of the Air Force
3834	5	This year’s military parade took place at the Great Alexander Street in Thessaloniki for the national anniversary of October 28, in the presence of the President of the Republic, Katarina Sakelaropoulos.
3834	7	The eyes of about 20,000 viewers of the parade attracted, among other things, the newly acquired French-made Rafale fighter aircraft as well as the deflated first-line Marder fighter vehicles.
3834	9	For the inflated Marder it was also the first time they gave the “parade” to a military parade in Greece as the first of them arrived in Greece 11 days ago, on October 17.
3834	11	The Marder 1A3 TOMS, which are received within the framework of our country’s related agreement with Germany, will be promoted to the Unit of the D’Army and specifically to the Ebro, as Mitosotakis announced in a press interview with German Chancellor Olaf Solz.
3834	13	In total, Greece is expected to receive 40 TOMAS MARDER 1A3 with the aim of upgrading the charter of the Army Units of the Greek Army, increasing their fighting power, as well as enhancing the interoperability of the Machinery Pessy Units with those of the Inflated.
3834	15	Indications of the value of the specific inflated what the honorable head of the GETHAS, Mikhail Kostarakos, had written when he had decided to replace the old Soviet inflated TOMAS BMP-1: “The political and military leadership of the country, the government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the GETHAS and the GES are worthy of congratulations for the decision to replace the old Soviet (Flated Fighting Vehicles) TOMAS BMP-1, known for limited operational value with the newest, modern and reliable German TOMAS, and the introduction of the new German TOMAS to the same role. The misconceptions and the negligence of the Motorcycle for many years, finally seems to come to an end. The legendary world-wide Greek pedestrian for its scary shipments with the skies is now finally equipped with the appropriate Fighting Vehicles.”
3834	17	The Raffairs of the Heaven
3834	19	Similarly impressive are the images with the Rafale which for a few months have joined the potential of the Greek Air Force and a special moment was the joint flight that made the legendary Spitfire MJ755 along with a F-16 of the Air Force.
3834	22	It is remembered that the first six Rafale landed in January on the 114 Battle Wings carry all the advanced equipment. The self-defense systems and the AESA electronic scanning radar, which offers an infinite range greater than the current capabilities of the fighters in the arsenal of the Air Force, thus the comparatively higher possibility of disclosure of all potential targets.
3834	24	As the protothema.gr wrote then, an important element is that the Rafale carries weapons and missiles that they already use and the Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft of the Air Force, in which a core of flyers has already been melted.
3834	26	One of the very critical elements that differentiate the Rafale from any other fighter aircraft is in the service of the Greek Armed Forces or flights to coalition aircraft east of the Egean region are the two engines, which offer very high “livability.”
3834	28	They give Rafale an action radius of more than 1,000 miles from the landing point, since their range (calculated the route to the end point of the mission and the distance to return to their base) reaches 2,800 miles.
3834	30	Since combat aircraft are a platform for weapons transportation, “The Winds”, as the name Rafale is translated into Greek, will have all the possibilities to guard the Greek heavens and will be able to identify all potential targets. The most basic “feat” on the Rafale fence is the Meteor air-air missiles. With a range of more than 100 kilometers, Meteor will give Rafale the opportunity to hit the opponent fighter aircraft long before they are threatened by them.
3835	1	The end of the neo-class leftist sovereignty on Twitter: Elon Musk expelled those who “imagine” Trump
3835	3	The billionaire, Elon Musk, made it clear that he wanted to be his own most Twitter from the beginning, posting the phrase “the bird is flying free now” and releasing those responsible for censorship to former U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as those who dared to express their views and were not pleasant to any world-regional class.
3835	5	The acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk is a global geopolitical event of enormous importance that lacks the power centers that control Western societies at the moment, the most important propaganda center, as Twitter in propaganda power has largely overcome the television that is now considered an outdated medium.
3835	7	Everyone remembers a methodized censorship operation to lose former President Trump in the 2020 elections which not only banned him from expressing his opinions but has also been organized a campaign to defamate him by thousands of “trolls”.
3835	9	The results are known. U.S. President T. Biden has been elected (as he was elected) and since then the planet has been stumbled by a global economic crisis and has reached the edge of a nuclear war.
3835	11	The post by Elon Musk, Twitter, banned freedom of view on issues that disturbed the extremist circles that control the government of Biden and unfortunately the western power centers, such as the issue of pandemic and mass vaccinations, how Trump lost the elections, the huge responsibilities of the U.S. in challenging the U.S. conflict, the “impression” of the Russians in expressing their own positions, etc.
3835	13	“The bird is flying freely now” means that everyone will be able to “thanks” that it makes him crazy.
3835	15	In essence, it means that former President Trump will be able to be a candidate for the 2024 presidential election again, having at his disposal the great weapon that is Twitter.
3835	17	His opponents knew that whatever they did to disguise Trump with organized attacks by the media, he would not have an opposition as much as he and his voters could “tweet”.
3835	19	Now, thousands of users post “forbidden” up to previous messages such as: “Peditor is a pet and must receive the death penalty”, “the 2020 elections were overwhelmed”, “Ivermaktin has excellent effects against the coronavirus.”
3835	21	The first action of Elon Musk was the urgent dismissal of Twitter’s legal adviser Vijaya Gadde, who is considered responsible for suspending Trump’s account from the platform.
3835	23	At the meeting of the Twitter executives under the new owner if someone saw her face he probably knew what was waiting for her... and that mainly because he knew what he had done...

3835	51	The new owner of Twitter, is believed to be again allowing Russian media to express their own version of what is happening in Ukraine (as it is a supporter of freedom of expression and opinion) and already in the U.S. (principally to the Democrats and the government of Biden) has been “cold sweating” because they know how important is the UNDP, which especially in the last two years has been entirely successful as the collective unconsciousness of the masses “programmed” easily when they don’t hear the other opinion.
3835	53	A few hours after the opening of a new era on Twitter Inc., the billionaire new owner of the platform was overwhelmed by calls and requests from accounts owners who have been excluded from the social media, and by global leaders.
3835	55	U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been permanently excluded from Twitter due to accusations of incitement to violence after the 6th January 2021 disarmament in Capitol, greeted the acquisition today, but said he would not return to Twitter.
3835	57	“I’m very happy that Twitter is now in healthy hands and will not be managed by the crazy of the radical left who really hate our country,” he wrote in a post on his own network, Truth Social.
3835	59	“I’m like Elon, but I’m still in Truth,” Trump later told Fox News.
3835	61	Dmitry Medvedev, former President of Russia and now Vice President of the Security Council of Russia, tweeted his congratulations:
3835	63	“Happy luck, Elon Musk, overcoming political prejudice and ideological dictatorship on Twitter. And leave Starlink’s operations in Ukraine.”
3835	65	Others asked Mr. Musk to remove the penalties imposed by the social networking platform.
3835	67	In response to @catturd2, an anonymous account with 852,000 followers, known as a great supporter of Trump’s allegations of election fraud and who said it was blocked by many users, Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter: “I’m going to deal more today.”
3836	1	“The mice jump from the boat”: To and A. Georgiades who had him at Maximo to laugh attacked K.Metsotakis
3836	3	The responsibility to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitosotaki was put on by the Vice-President of the ND and Minister of Development, Adonis Georgiades, for the election of A.Patsis in the voting table of the ND.
3836	5	He said he was “badly elected” and won a parliamentary seat with the ND.
3836	7	This means that he himself considers M.Methasaki responsible for this choice.
3836	9	And it is noted that what Georgiades says, his political positions etc. They it in a kind of tolerance to Maximo and to rejoice even more they posted videos with his broadcasts to laugh (here is a related video).
3836	11	You believe that the government of K.Mesotakis in the Patty Scandal:
3836	13	- He is innocent (4%, 674 Votes)
3836	15	- He knew but tried to stop his activity (8%, 1,250 Votes)
3836	17	- He is coherent and must resign (86%, 14,026 Votes)
3836	19	- I don't know / I don't answer (2%, 368 Votes)
3836	21	The total number of votes: 16,318
3836	23	However, in order not to get tired of it, everyone in the ND knew everything about Patsis, but he was careful to announce it publicly. After his cancellation from the NGO of the Netherlands due to the scandal of speculation on the expense of thousands of borrowers and the one million euros he had “chiped” from the ELTAs.
3836	25	“My party knew my activity,” he said yesterday, meaning Kyriakos Mitosotakis and New Democracy knew his activities with the red loans and the foreign companies heins since 2019!
3836	27	“Do you think a party doesn’t know who it has in its voting sheets?” he continued saying that his activities with foreign companies and the removal of citizens with red loans “was not a glimpse in ether, nor has anyone discovered America.”
3836	29	As regards today’s statements of the deputy chairman and Minister of Development, the journalists asked Mr. Georgiades directly: “Do you know Mr. Patsis’ actions all these years?”
3836	31	“The truth is that no, I didn’t know Mr. Patsis’ action, I don’t know the personal profession of any member of the ND, you’ll allow me to do so. I didn’t know about Mr. Patty’s work. If you were asking me “What is Patty?” I would call you “advocate.” So far I understood it,” Mr. Georgiades said.
3836	33	He even tried to avoid the obvious, as the journalists pointed out to him, that he said “there should be your party to know” and that “you’re the party’s vice president,” the journalists resisted. “Do you don’t think there’s a responsibility for how the ND chooses its candidates?”
3836	35	Thus, Mr. Georgiades was forced to admit that “if Mr. Patsis had this activity and before becoming a member of the parliament, he was very badly elected,” referring to the elections on his own vice-president in the party.
3836	37	He attempted at the same time to “pull the waters,” saying what is already known is not true for red loans and the Patze scandal.
3836	39	“If it’s got it ‘the way’ it’s something that the party has not noticed. He learned it, he wrote it.” And his journalists “cut it,” reminding that “two years ago the topic came to the present.” The deputy chairman says that he “not noticed” the path of Mr. Patsis from the jury to the involvement and claim of involvement in a number of regional PAEs, such as Larissa, Herakles, OFE, Panyonio, but finally the Victory of Vole with the sharp rise and fall.
3836	41	Suppose he does not know the complaints of Manol Skufali that he had been threatened with a weapon by Andreas Patisse to resolve his contract with Victory Volo.
3836	43	He was living in another country, like everyone else in the Netherlands.
3837	1	"The Ministry of Culture gives large private the ""fair remuneration"" of the artists"
3837	3	A new draft law that incorporates three EU directives on intellectual rights in Greek law was submitted to public consultation (up to 1 November) by the Ministry of Culture.
3837	5	The draft law concerns, among other things, the intellectual rights of the artists from the reasonable remuneration derived from the audio or image or audio and image reproduction devices.
3837	7	In particular, Article 43 of the proposed draft law of the Ministry of Culture fully rejects the so far applicable, both in Greece and internationally, as regards the obligation of the importers and manufacturers of technical means / equipment (electronic computers, tablets, mobile phones, etc.) to pay the reasonable remuneration provided for in Article 18 n. 2121/1993 to the creators of the works for the private reproduction of their works.
3837	9	The reaction of both the Collective Copyright Management Organizations and the Opposition was immediate.
3837	11	"As characteristically stated in a statement, Syriza's Minister of Culture Sia Annostepulou: ""The Ministry of Culture gives three to four large enterprises the article 43 of the under-consultation copyright bill, demonstrating the interests of large companies, on the back of thousands of creators and beneficiaries."
3837	13	Again, the Ministry of Culture, with a continuing war against culture, is trying to add to a draft law-directive of the European Union, an article that removes from the intellectual rights of the Greek rightholders another important source of a legitimate and stable right, that relates to “fair remuneration”.
3837	15	So far, what is applicable to the obligation to pay copyright to the creators is that the importers and producers are obliged to pay a “righteous remuneration” for all technical means and devices available to individuals, as well as to/professional, as they are used for reproduction for private use, either directly or after their subsequent availability by these entrepreneurs to individuals.
3837	17	The new Article 43 aims to completely abolish the reasonable remuneration in favour of the beneficiaries. From 1 January 2023 the importers and producers are granted the right not to include in their accountable statements the majority of the equipment and technical means they import or produce, simply and only by the assumption that they have sold them to legal persons, describing them as professional.
3837	19	“Culture and culture. Mendoe, clearly supporting the interests of large companies, not only removes the reasonable remuneration by reducing more than 60% of the compensation of the beneficiaries, but destroys the Greek and European legislation, the constant relevant jurisprudence of the Greek courts, the Court of Justice, as well as the judgment of Arius Pago. 2097/2013) which claims that the provisions of Article 43 are legally incorrect.
3837	21	The HIPPO’s tactics of closing the eye to large enterprises, offering them the opportunity to escape their obligations with a simple responsible statement, as well as the constant tactics of closing the doors and ears to the critical problems of people of Culture, will not continue,” says Sia Lectopoulos, asking the Ministry of Culture to immediately withdraw Article 43 because if voted “it will mean the most unfair treatment and redistribution to three – four large enterprises, at the back of thousands of creators and beneficiaries.”
3837	23	The Collective Copyright Management Agency (EDEM) commented on:
3837	25	In accordance with Article 43 of the new draft law, from 1 January 2023 the importers and producers are entitled not to include at all in their accountable statements the majority of the equipment and technical means they import or produce, on the grounds that they are intended for commercial use.
3837	27	This provision disrupts the system of payment to the collective management agencies of the reasonable remuneration referred to in Article 18(n). by 2121/1993. If applicable, it will cause a significant decrease in the rights obtained by the intellectual creators from reasonable remuneration.
3837	29	The ESMA, in cooperation with all the collective management agencies, will use all the institutional and legal means it has to immediately withdraw this provision which tries to revoke what has so far been valid in Greece and internationally to the right to reasonable remuneration of the creators.”
3838	1	Nico Androulakis for October 28: A Box of Responsibility and National Dignity
3838	3	“The ’40’s is a time-long symbol of sacrifice for the homeland,” said in a message on the 28th October anniversary, the president of PASOK KINAL, Nikos Androlakis.
3838	5	Nikos Andrulaqis added that “in the present era of geopolitical disturbances and great uncertainty we must work to strengthen the country’s position with economic and social conditions within the European Union, but also with a sense of unity to safeguard our national interests against all kinds of revisionism and especially the challenging Turkish leadership.
3838	7	Every dialogue should be based on international law and not on the law of the strong. Therefore, when some question the international conditions by undermining the stability in the Southeast Mediterranean, they do not tolerate equal distances from partners or the leadership of NATO. There are no new arrangements for equipment. The sacrifice of the Greeks in the epoch of the 40s will always be a pipe of responsibility and national dignity for all of us. Many years to all the Greeks and all the Greeks.”
3839	1	Study Parade in Athens - The Statements of Officials
3839	3	The state's duty to teach the new generation the glorious past of the country was mentioned by the Minister of Education and Religions, Niki Keramoso, in her statements after the end of the parade in the center of Athens.
3839	5	The parade in Athens was completed with brightness and praise.
3839	7	“With great pride and enthusiasm we watched our children, students and students celebrate this historic day. “On the day of the great ‘NO’ against the invader, on which we honor the struggle against fascism and Nazism, the struggle of our ancestors for all of us to be free today,” Minister Vicky Keramoso said.
3839	9	Keramoso, Patulis, Bakoyanni, at the parade
3839	11	“It is our duty to teach our children the glorious past, to teach them how much our ancestors fought to be free today. By teaching the glorious past, we are pursuing a better present and we are looking for an even more hopeful future.”
3839	13	On his side, the Attica regionalist, Georgios Patulis, emphasized: “Eighty-two years have passed from Greece’s great, historical NO to the conquerors. The same I will say NO whenever necessary again, because we have our proud army, but above all our young people, who know – and have demonstrated it with today’s parade – to be close to the values but above all with pride toward our ancestors, who have been sacrificed to be free.”
3839	15	The mayor of Athens, Kosta Bakojani, in his statements, talked about a “generation-to-generation scatter” that emphasizes what unites us. “Happiness, enthusiasm, enthusiasm and pride for the children who made a parade today and held the flag up,” Mr. Bakojani said, adding, “It’s a scitallory from generation to generation, it’s proven in practice that all that unites us is much more than the few that separate us.”
384	1	Some women will “just” lose their lives.
384	2	Women’s lives can be awaited, sacrificed or disputed at an institutional, systemic and personal level, as it has been for centuries now.
384	4	“Hesus slept and slept, but I wrapped my back on the wall and waited for the morning. I learned English, I thought. I read all the English I knew. The court [...] hamburger, papers, how much it does, marry them.”
384	6	The recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court which denied the constitutional protection of the right to abortion opened the way for its upcoming restriction. Dobbs marked a black, superconservative page in the history of the Supreme Court and made me look for Lucia Berlin’s speech from where the original phrase came. 
384	8	"The discourse is called Mijito and is one of the many of the Home Assistant Guidelines collection where we meet women who slide within the hole network of inappropriate social welfare in the United States. Women who can't buy their baby's pins, speak broken English about the completely necessary phrases of life (""love them""), alcoholics who go into dependency, assistants of gynecologists, patients of gynecologists, mothers or daughters."
384	10	These nightmare rooms of the Berlin heroes who speak Spanish and sleep on their child from overwhelming I think these days. 
384	12	Even if we are not poor cleaners in Texas, we can mentally pass the distance between our lives and their own and we are forced to rise because we are not far from all this magnificent campaign against the female bodies.
384	13	They will be lost or killed by the ban of abortions. They will have children people who don’t want them or who can’t raise them. They will destroy dreams and hopes due to youth mistakes or some abuse incident and will lose their health or life women with complications in pregnancy.
384	15	Those who cannot go anywhere else or pay, to get it, according to a classic argument against excessive state intervention.
384	17	We observe a clear attack on the poor and unemployed, those who don’t speak English, are not white or who don’t have support and social surroundings. They will not be able to end their pregnancy in a safe way. They would seek home treatments, combianitis, online advice and nightmare doctors who, naively, we thought they had no place in one of the world’s largest economies. 
384	19	The gap is deepening. From one of the elite universities with advanced research (and in medical subjects), the rich California hippies that will not see (we hope!) Their rights to turn around, the white wealthy, superformed who will pay on the black market to get rid of their pregnancy. On the other hand, the unusable, the deprived of any insurance, care or guarantee, the donated in their homes and families, those who if they face a medical problem in pregnancy, should literally be sacrificed.
384	21	The little evil. They are women. Their sacrifice is their history. And history is a source of convincing, allegedly legal arguments, at least in the current superconservative composition of the court.
384	23	This loss of rights in the United States concerns us. The idea of “freedom” which gains land is something untouchable that arms and reminds Trump. What does this freedom have to do with the idea of freedom that has made so many people around the world, since the years of Tocqueville already, look to America to throw arguments in favor of the organization of societies with an emphasis on rights?  
384	25	For many years we have heard that some things are solved and outdated. “The world goes from the good to the best” – especially the western! A certain degree of privilege is needed, so that one is finally surprised that the world is not flexible and “condemned” to constant improvement.
384	27	Such blindness implies that you have not seen your body becoming a source of claims for others. Even if we are not poor cleaners in Texas, we can mentally pass the distance between our lives and their own and we are forced to rise because we are not far from all this magnificent campaign against the female bodies.

3840	1	Greece: Greece is the expanding country
3840	3	“They accuse Turkey of expansion. The one that really expands is Greece itself, which has entered our nose since its establishment and continuously causes and threatens Turkey,” Huluchi Akar said.
3840	5	A new attack in Greece was made by the Turkish Defence Minister, Hulusi Akar, from the opening of the Defence, Aerospace and Space Industry Exhibition SAHA EXPO. “As we approach problems with peaceful solutions, some well-known Greek politicians have invented a doctrine that they called Neo-Othmanism to cover their own dreams of the Great Idea.
3840	7	They accuse Turkey of expansion. The one that really expands is Greece itself, which has entered our nose since its establishment and continuously causes and threatens Turkey.”
3840	9	Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said: “We have always respected the borders and sovereign rights of all our neighbors and we continue to do so. Our only goal is to ensure the security of our country and our nation. Our expectation from our neighbors is to behave reasonably and wisely and to respect our sovereign rights on the basis of international law. Despite the challenging actions and rhetoric, we always make great efforts to keep the channels of dialogue with our neighboring Greece open and we always stretch our hand to peace for stability in our region. We approach problems and try to find peaceful solutions.”
3840	11	Huluchi Akar said that “these politicians, with their statements, cause great damage to the Greek people. They also sabotage and destroy the way to peace and dialogue between the two countries. Despite the positions of the Greek politicians that have nothing to do with reality, nor with mathematics, logic, and laws, we are still under the leadership of our president to strive for peace and prosperity, as well as to make the Egean and Mediterranean a sea of friendship, where all their wealth will be fairly shared. Nevertheless...”
3841	1	Ministry of Digital Governance: Greece is changing by projects, not by slope
3841	3	Reply to a statement by the Digital Governance department Syriza-Progressive Alliance Mr. Katse:
3841	5	With regard to today’s announcement of the Syriza-Progressive Alliance Digital Governance department based on a report from the Journal of Publishers and relating to the assignments of the Information Society A.E., a supervised body of the Ministry of Digital Governance, the following are clarified:
3841	7	The Journal of Publishers repeats a question which has been recently answered to its author’s question. As it has already been emphasized, the direct assignments of the Ministry of Digital Governance account for less than 2% of the total budget of the Ministry’s projects and its supervised entities.
3841	9	These assignments mainly concern either platforms that constitute gov.gr services, which are added daily to the Single Digital Portal in order to facilitate the citizen, or special needs of the Covid-19 era, which had to be implemented within a few weeks, such as the country’s vaccine platform. Especially for the latter, the comments are excessive. The experience of every Greek speaks over and the lives saved thanks to the Operation “Freedom”. It is also obvious that in all independent procedures the current legislation, i.e. the law 4412/2016, which Syriza introduced, was unrelatedly observed.
3841	11	For years, in Greece, the digital transformation was dramatically delayed. We received a country that measured a total of just 8.8 million digital transactions of citizens with the Greek Public in 2018, a number that in 2022 will reach 1 billion. This is achieved through the great reform of the gov.gr and the 1471 services and related platforms that it so far contains, several of which are over-the-counter projects of the specific assignments. As every citizen can find out, the annual yield in the number of digital transactions in 2018 today takes place in approximately four days.
3841	13	Finally, on the political substance, Syriza’s goal is clear: daily – now – blurry to the fan with the aim of intentionally preventing the completion of a large project in the benefit of the citizens, this digital reform of the state. It is clear that it is a subjugation by the official opposition, so that the work of the Ministry of Digital Governance is to be voted, a target useless and condemned to fail. The experience of improving the service of each citizen is a life of the Greek society and the conquest of all the Greeks regardless of political beliefs.
3841	15	In the face of the continuous, increasing and directed efforts to shut down, we respond primarily with our work. There are those who build and those who break. We belong to the first, Syriza chose to belong to the second.

3843	5	Photo documentation of the 92 naked refugees and migrants in Ebro was provided during his meeting with the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Chaba Korosi, the Minister of Migration and Political Affairs South Mitarakis, who asked for a thorough investigation of the incident and denounced Turkey’s attitude to the refugee-migrant.
3843	7	disappointment
3843	9	According to Sky respondent in New York, the documents presented by South Mitarakis on the 92 naked migrants caused a shock to Mr. Corosi, who did not hide his disturbance, and praised Greece’s overall attitude on the issue.
3843	11	Greece, the South Mitarakis said, will not accept further instrumentalization of migrants from Turkey.
3843	13	At the same time, the Minister of Immigration and Asylum, stressed that it should be clear that it is another humanitarian part in migration, and another dealing with the criminals. “Turkish duty is to protect its borders so that migrants do not leave, as Greece’s duty is to prevent their escape to Western Europe,” he said.

It is unacceptable, these 92 people were trained by the neighborhood authorities, according to their own witnesses, were saved by Frontex and the Greek authorities. This incident must necessarily be thoroughly examined, and must not be repeated,” South Mitarakis said in a statement.

3844	1	SYRIZA - PS: It disrupts point-to- point the optimism of Mitosotaki after the meeting with Solch
3844	3	With eight retorical questions SYRIZA-PS commented on Kyriakou Mitosotaki’s meeting with German Chancellor Solz, completely denying the prime minister’s optimism. As the opposition official notes, “the inflated BMP 1 is withdrawn from the islands without replacement and Mr. Mishotakis declares much more optimistic.”
3844	5	Syriza-PS emphasizes that “Mitsotakis said today that he is “very optimistic” after the meeting with Chancellor Solch. Where does this optimism really come from?
3844	7	With his announcement, SYRIZA-PS commented with an ironic style on the “excellence” that Prime Minister saw during his contacts with the German Chancellor, while pointing out what K. Mishotakis incredibly said about the inflated ones who are withdrawn from the islands but are not replaced, a matter for which Ankara has been pressing for a long time.
3844	9	The statement of the Syriza-Progressive Alliance Press Office:
3844	11	“The inflated BMP 1 is withdrawn from the islands without a replacement and Mr. Mishotakis says much more optimistic.
3844	13	"Mitosotakis said he was ""very optimistic"" after the meeting with Chancellor Solch."
3844	15	Where does this optimism really come from?
3844	17	- From the fact that Germany does not accept not a euro bond and a joint loan for a courageous crisis response program that comes, but not even a plateau in energy prices?
3844	19	- From the fact that instead of the deflated Marder vehicles to replace the BMP1 withdrawn from the islands, will they be placed on the Ebro?
3844	21	- From the fact that Germany is limited to generological and obvious statements about Turkish aggression without any condemnation or even criticism of its neighbor?
3844	23	"From the direct recommendation of the German Chancellor ""to do no comparisons between the Ukrainian and Eastern Mediterranean""?"
3844	25	Do you want Germany to sell submarines to Turkey?
3844	27	From the German Chancellor’s Afonia for Refugees, for a Legal Agreement on Immigration and Asylum or at least for the Instrumentation by Turkey?
3844	29	From Germany’s persistence to exclude Greece from the international talks on Libya while the one Turkish agreement follows the other?
3844	31	Or, finally, the fact that the only Greek-German debate is about the equipment of Ukraine and not about a peace initiative and the end of Russian invasion to the standards of the dragi proposal?
3844	33	Other words to be loved by N.D.
3844	35	With the well-known tactic of “other words to love”, and obvious disgrace in front of the questions that arise, the New Republic characterizes the SYRIZA-PS announcement “for internal consumption”.
3844	37	The 2014 “Go back Mrs. Merkel” became “Go back Mr. Scholz” in 2022. As if a day did not pass. This is all about the internal audience. Because in Europe they are fighting for their participation as observers in the European Socialists and show good behavior to become equal members with Mr. Solz and his bonds.”
3845	1	Trolls
3845	3	The removal was complete, and the remover recognizes it. But the way he defends himself, the arguments he uses, the flies he flies, even his trolls, concrete all the pathogens of the immortal Greek race.
3845	5	First of all, the classic “I didn’t know.” I stopped the road because I was running with excessive speed and I am justified that I didn’t know that the limit was 80 km. I get into the bus without a mask and at the check I say I didn’t know how to wear it. I am a lawyer, but I didn’t know it’s incompatible for a member to join an offshore company. “And no one took me a phone to tell me, you know something, that shouldn’t be so.”
3845	7	The next line of defense is “OK, I’m not yesterday, all Greece knew my action.” Do you not do it yourself or, in any case, do you not want to do it?Do you not want, in other words, to take advantage of your position to get from a bank a loan that is not justified by your income and then, thanks to this position, to buy from the same bank red loans at 1/15 of their value?
3845	9	There is a necessary self-criticism. I might have made some mistake. I may have forgotten to refer to my Potting Essays where I found the 4 million. Do you want to help me? - I want to help you. - I want to help you. I wanted to inherit two companies to my children. “If this is my political path, let it be...”
3845	11	The main thing, however, is that in depth I am a good man and I take care of my citizens. As an independent, I will not have any party slavery. Therefore I do not give my seat for the sake of the Greens, for the one who will follow me may not care so much. “From the last minute I will be the Andreas you know.”
3845	13	In all of this, of course, there are truths. He’s not like the other who says he didn’t know he was twenty-year-old, he thought he was twenty-year-old. When Andreas Patsis claims that everyone knew, he suggests that complaints had been made, questions had been formulated, publications had been made, but he didn’t set any of the ear. When he says he hasn’t entered the ballot alone, he means that a party leader should have controlled him, disrupted his activities, distinguished what’s legal and what’s ethical, and warned him. When he acknowledges that he was well dismissed but at the same time holds his headquarters, he confirms that trolling is a component of Greek political life.
3846	1	New Year's Eve: Political Revolutions - The Revolutions
3846	3	The railways are now railways. Not because the people are armed. Weapons and barriers are not inside, but around them. Thousands of police officers would wear weapons (some of them would at the same time prefer the place of the demonstrator), there would be old-summer tears, more modern chemicals and bright lighting, auras, motor vehicles, drones, helicopters.
3846	5	Not of course the provocators: Their action, always dangerous and indifferent to the impact as a whole, is controlled in a personalized way. The oppression forces put the anonymous new protestant and some tired but proud refugees next to them. Usually poor, willing to risk to change their conditions of life. These are the worries of every oligarchy.
3846	7	In the history of the ports for the Polytechnic, every year new pages are written. Here is a picture of the 1973 revolt. Thro the 1990s followed the volatile and enthusiastic paths, but stigmatized by bloody episodes of repression (with the victims of Kumé, Kanelopoulos, Kaltesa). The follow-up was rather straight-line, with a stable number of protesters and an increasing number of prisons. But as the momentum has risen again in recent years, something is obvious: the magic of self-righteousness and mass claim always remains on the path of the present.
3846	9	The variation of collective protests was international. The beginning of the 2000s was marked by massive terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers and metropolitan centers in Europe. The world was scared, the terrorism objectively acted as a provocation, the population of the protests drowned. On the contrary, the police, already after the large protests in Seattle in 1999, succeeded in a rapid modernization of organization and equipment, surveillance.
3846	11	But the need for the majority to express themselves and to demand equality and rights by protesting is unclean. Some people don’t understand why they’re faced, powerful or brave or apologizing. Today I have two thoughts.
3846	13	What has been mentioned above, are scary, irresistible images of the dynamics of the protests. Between the first steps for the Polytechnic and the present, there is another historical change. In the beginning, the policy was a demand. The church, the temple of democracy. The parties had been hunted by the junta, they had been missing, their flags and symbols had already flattered and felt feelings of freedom and joy in the world. Today things have almost gone back. Among those young people who demonstrate, there are many, unemployed, difficult, revolutionaries with a cause that – in the best case – is still looking for, kept away from any confidence and appreciation in politics, see politicians as marionets, other evil and other joke.
3846	15	Of course I understand them and see the emptiness of teaching. The time passed when I did lessons, and then I avoided the notions. Two words only here, transferring an experience from a short passage from the field of political power. It may seem useful to others.
3846	17	A complaint is cruel if there is nothing else to put in the place of the one we complain. You can’t change the world alone, but there are others around you with dreams, plans and hopes. If we are indifferent to democracy, the alternative is the oligarchy, with its shells the neoliberalism and the extreme right. What we saw before was the surface of the burk, the bottom and drowning are lower, waiting for those who remain without ideas and ways of fighting. Social peace, human rights, the land with its green, now need the construction of a new policy, education and the air of justice.

3847	1	Three of Rubicon in the house of Georgiad - Condemns Syriza
3847	3	Intervention by members of Rubicon with trips occurred on Thursday night, outside the house of Ad. and Georgian.
3847	5	The news was made known by the Minister of Development through a post to his personal Twitter account, which was accompanied by a series of photos from the site.
3847	7	"However, although the trials were signed by Rubicon, Mr. Georgiades threw the responsibility to SYRIZA. Specifically, he wrote that such attacks come ""when he says something that is very disturbing Alexis Tsipras."""
3847	9	“A strange thing every time I say something that annoys Alexis Tsipras comes Rubikona and attacks my house with my children inside...there will be a coincidence and Syriza definitely condemns the attack at my house I’m sure...children we’re not afraid you know,” he wrote in his post.
3847	11	"Immediately, the intervention of the government representative, Janni Oikonomu, described the members of Rubicon as ""trabucks"", while he emphasized that he is expecting the condemnation of the attack by all political forces."
3847	13	“After a while in the house of the Minister of Development, Adoni Georgiad, while his children were in the house, Rubicon’s tramps were attacked. We condemn this unrighteous attack by the lobbies of this organization and we expect the same from all political forces. It is clear and complete,” said Mr. Houston.
3848	1	“Politics is disturbing those who have to disturb”
3848	3	“The Polytechnic is living in today’s matches and continues to disturb,” said Syriza-PS’s press spokesman Nasos Eliopoulos in an interview with the radio station “On Red 105.5 FM”, discussing today’s anniversary of the Polytechnic rebellion.
3848	5	“Democracy is always a source of tension, conflict. The world that enters these conflicts, in order to claim rights, freedom, pride, always needs some “unknown.” And the Polytechnic is one of the most stable such ankles,” he noted.
3848	7	“It is important that the Polytechnic always keeps against it all the ‘just’ enemies,” Nassos Solyopoulos added.
3848	9	“The Polytechnic continues to cause anger, anger, and anger in the conservative party. One of the main reasons is that historical moments like these are moments of pride for the people. As long as a particular narrative wants to suggest that the junta fell from its own internal contradictions, we know that the breakthrough point is that it stopped tolerance from the Greek society. And the expression of this thing was the Polytechnic,” Nassos Solyopoulos emphasized.
3848	11	“In every age and in every generation, there is the different raw material that feeds significant cinematic events,” he said.
3848	13	“Today there is a dominant policy that is committed to the wrath of society and that in daily terms,” he said, referring to the picture made by the internet round, which shows baby milk on a supermarket rail, “data” with a counter-system.
3848	15	“Mr. Georgiades told us that this is normal. But what is not normal is that there is a family that is unable to pay the milk for her baby. And on the basis of the data we have, while poverty had decreased until 2019, the poverty in Greece has increased in the last three years,” Nassos Elliopoulos said.
3848	17	He also said that the index of unclean health needs is also worsening: “This index in ’19 was at 8%, today it is close to 30%, more than 1 in 4 citizens have health problems that they can’t deal with.”
3848	19	As regards the issues of democracy, Nasos Eliopoulos noted: “progressive government with SYRIZA-PS means that in the first days of government this story will end with the MATs at universities and with the university police.”
3848	21	“Democracy is not luxury,” he said.
3849	1	It is normal for the Adonis Georgiadi to lock the products in the supermarkets with reflections.
3849	3	When asked about the phenomenon in the large supermarket chains to lock with reflux baby milk, coffee packaging and other products, the response of the Minister of Development Adoni Georgiadi was: “It’s happening throughout Europe. It’s normal some chains want to protect their property.”

Not only did it seem not to realize the enormous difficulties consumers face, but on the contrary he said that the phenomenon with reflectors on the products is not a rule and “Whoever bought last week from the household’s basket was won by 12%.”
3849	15	The comment of Nasu Solyopoulos, a press spokesman for SYRIZA-PS:

385	1	Treatment of Alan Turing
385	2	The lightly pink sympathy that those who put the colourful flag over everything in June pursue should not cover the violence in the lives of the queer individuals.
385	4	If I have to choose a queer idol, I will choose Alan Turing. The lightly pink sympathy that those who put the colourful flag over everything in June pursue should not cover the violence in the lives of the queer individuals. Women in our country can easily perceive this because they are experiencing the same murderous violence.
385	6	Turing was a victim of an unfair law that prosecuted sexual acts (will be said “premium”) among men in Britain. Almost all legal classes had similar provisions until recently. And Germany and Greece, for example, had provided in their Criminal Code for “unnatural impeachment” among men.
385	10	One argument that was often argued when one demanded the abolition of such provisions was that these laws were not frequently applied, but had fallen into uselessness. It is a funny argument, because frequency does not remove injustice. And only the existence of such provisions, where they existed or still exist, is a blow to the law.
385	12	In our country, only this year, mutation treatments were banned and blood donation was allowed by gay boys. The unfair and unfair connection of disease-sexuality has not been completely eliminated.
385	13	Turing (1912-1954) was a famous mathematician and pioneer in computer science. His work determined the evolution of what we now call “computer” and “algoritm,” while his services during World War II in the field of decoding the messages of the enemy became films, books and graphic novels. By its publication in 1935 it put the foundations of modern computer theory. He liked running, he was a runner. It is considered the father (for a beautiful patriarchal expression) of artificial intelligence.
385	15	The great historian Hobbspaum in his massive work The Age of the Ends (history of the period 1914-1991) dedicates some pages to Turing. He was a strange guy. Hobbspaum talks about a young man who didn’t look much, though he later became “a kind of idol for homosexuals.”
385	17	Hobbspaum is not limited to the irony about Turing’s insignificant appearance, but he acknowledges that no one in Cambridge at that time had taken care of the cosmogenic changes that occurred within the small counties of mathematics. The historian acknowledges that in the pirates the genius of mathematical logic was not open to him. Not that he was uninterested (only for lack of curiosity no one can blame him!But rather the drunk mathematics believed that they would not even understand what the problem was tortuing them.
385	19	The incomprehensible results of Turing’s research, however, found early application in new technologies. He was philosophically concerned with the human brain and its function. Many of the things we are now discussing about the domination of artificial intelligence or the connection of human and artificial intelligence are triggered in the course-matematics.
385	21	"Turing was sentenced to a twelve-month ""healing"" for his homosexual trends, which marked the end of his career in national security, since homosexuals were then considered by nature the enemy of the state. The idea behind the criminalization of behavior was that female carrying is a disease that is healed. Even on this basis the mandatory hormone treatment sounds cruel practice. Chemical therapy disrupted the hormones of mathematics, which eventually committed suicide in 1954. Some claim that he was accidentally poisoned on the investigation."
385	23	Unfair laws destroy the lives of people. If one thinks what Turing could have offered to mankind if he lived another thirty years, his loss is even more tragic. Would he continue to decodify the secrets of machines and living organisms (the scope of his research in the last years of his life); Where would artificial intelligence have reached if he had been allowed to live as a “significant” researcher at a quiet college in the province of England?
385	25	In our country, only this year, mutation treatments were banned and blood donation was allowed by gay boys. The unfair and unfair connection of disease-sexuality has not been completely eliminated. With the appearance of the blessing of the bears some people again linked disease and sexuality expressing their own sick mind rather than concerns about public health. But the world is changing. Now is the Turing Age.
3850	1	Christos Stylianides is alleged to participate in a panel of extreme-right congress in Poland
3850	3	According to Dimitri Angelides’ report at the European Union, at a conference on the topic “The global problem of the Christianity”, organized by the Polish organization Centre for the Protection of Christian Rights, seems to be a participating Minister of Civil Protection and Climate Change Christos Stylianides.
3850	5	“Mystery” is how his name was found in the published list of speakers that will be co-organized tomorrow in Turin, Poland by the Euroskeptic Eurogroup of European Conservatives and Reformists, which belongs to the extreme-right party of the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the Greek Solution of Cyriac Belopoulos and other extreme-conservative and extreme-right parties of Europe.
3850	7	Communications providers are the local radio Radio Maryja, known for its anti-Semitic and nationalist propaganda, the sister newspaper Nasz Dziennik and the TV station Trwam of the same group, the media that promote an extreme nationalist catholicism.
3851	1	The Greeks are a higher nation. 
3851	3	The Turkish authorities have requested medical care from the Greek woman injured by the bomb in Isticla for her care at a hospital in Istanbul. “It was the ‘thank’ for the strengthening of the Turkish economy by thousands of our fellow patriots – Did Greece ever charge medical expenses to a visitor of our country?
3851	5	These are the Turks. This is Turkey. Of course, the victims of the Istanbul bombing are also suffering from international compassion. But it seems that only in Turkey they are not treated with sympathy. Evidence, the fact that from the wounded in the explosion who were transferred to Turkish hospitals, are asked to pay hospitals. This revelation causes anger. The father of the 39-year-old Greedy, who was injured during the explosion, revealed it to a television station: “I was told that they would make an epilepsy to make her the operation, which will be charged, as will be charged the operation and the hospital care.” His reaction was the expected: “I told them that it is unacceptable for a foreign citizen, who was a victim of a terrorist attack, not to receive the medical care they need.”
3851	7	Would it ever be possible to do so in Greece? would Greece, either official or informal, be understood not to rush to cure a wounded person? victims of any type of attack or accident. Especially when the victim is a Greek visitor. Each of us feels a duty to him because he considers himself a host. It is an ancient tradition that requires the Greeks to consider the stranger as a saint. They are under the protection of the stranger. They only see the pockets of visitors to their country, whose content they seek by humble behavior to disguise. There is no connection between the inherent kindness of the Greek, which is associated with a proud dignity, and the inappropriate behavior of the co-patriot of Erdogan. It also emphasizes the fact that the money they receive from the visitors of Turkey is not respected. And when they fall victims of terrorism, for which the exclusive responsibility is the Turkish State, which failed to protect them, they ask them to pay the expenses of their hospitalization.
3851	9	It shows that Greeks are a higher nation. Not only to visitors, but also to every disadvantaged is provided medical care in our country. Insecure, immigrants, members of ‘social minorities’, all are taken to our hospitals. Sometimes at the expense of Greek taxpayers and insurers who pay the costs of hospitals.
3851	11	No one can expect such greatness from the fans of Asia. Those who know that to their guests, they have nothing to show. Christian monuments and ancient Greek antiquities go to visit tourists in Istanbul and Asia. And the half-month still on their flag is stolen. Symbol of the goddess Artemis, a guardian of the Megareans, ancient settlers of Byzantium. What to respect and what to appreciate?
3851	13	Even for the acceptance of complaints from Greece and the United States, their behavior was unacceptable! Erdogan had to meet with Biden and put him the issue of F-16 fighters in order to receive his condolences.
3851	15	This attitude is also provocative. For Erdogan himself, in terms of his psychosynthesis, is no different from the middle Turk. Who does not see the failure of his state and his security services. He lies responsibilities elsewhere. He is always grateful to Greeks. The Greek reporter of the Open television station, Maria Zakharaki, has been arrested. It’s enough to mention her statement: “I was imprisoned yesterday night because I’m Greek and I’m at the point of the attack. With the end of my response, my live yesterday night, came very close to the world of journalists. A Turk is coming to me and asks me, “Where are you from, from which country?” I answered “Greece,” and he began to say to me constantly, “and you in Greece who support the PKK, you are behind.” “And I saw,” he tells me without understanding Greek, “with how glad you the news. You are pleased with what has happened in Turkey.” I didn’t answer him, and he continued to say, “But you don’t answer, because you and your country are guilty of this story.”
3851	17	The only guilty, of course, here is Turkey itself, the country that oppresses, invades and destroys international law.

3853	5	More specifically, according to the tempo24 information, eight people were initially attached to the Police Directorate of Akaias, which had been identified by the MAT forces. Of the eight allegations, four were converted into arrestations.
3853	7	A 21 year old man arrested
3853	9	It is a 21-year-old girl and three men aged 23, 22 and 19, who say they are students of the University of Patron. The most serious charges relate to the 21-year-old, who has been accused of possession of explosives, involvement in disturbance of common peace and resistance against the authority.
3853	11	The accusations on the rest are of unlawful nature and relate to participation in disturbance of common peace and resistance against the authority.
3853	13	Rain from Molotov
3853	15	The investigation found that on Thursday night, 40 molotov bombs were thrown on the Corinth Road, some of which were linked with strawberries and strawberries.
3853	17	The attacks in Patra occurred shortly before 8 p.m. yesterday night in the center of Patra, when a group of people participating in the course for the anniversary of the Polytechnic, which had begun with the former attachment of the University, launched molotov bombs against the police.
3854	1	"PROPOSITIONS - G. TIPRAS - Rescue Sand with ""corns"" in defense "
3854	3	In political struggles with the National Defence and the Armed Forces, Syriza is looking for the relance for the clashes, after the responsive strikes in the opposition narrative that the public deviation from the party line of three of his leaders brought.
3854	5	After the boiling to the French Ambassador to abolish the mutual defence agreement, the Syriza’s electoral blender was added the “country” which thirty members of his parliamentary group, led by the party’s Defence department, Georgius Tsipras, are searching for in the Pentagon and the General Directorate of Defence Weapons and Investments.
3854	7	The effort of Syriza’s shadow “defense minister” is evident that it aims to give a political shift to the party strategy. A strategy that, according to the leaders of the majority, is overwhelmed in the milopters of the communications autogol and the introduction in the public sphere of the government’s legislative initiative for the ECB.
3854	9	With this pursuit during the blue reading leaves the lists of observations. In an up-to-date question to the Minister of National Defence, Nico Panayotopoulo, Mr. Georgios Tsipras addresses an outstanding as politically, scrutiny, documentation.
3854	11	The Defence officer of the opposition argues that the list containing the names of the Deputy Minister of National Defence Nikou Khadalia and the Director of the General Directorate of Defence Equipment and Investment (GDAEE), Anti-National Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army Army The Syriza staff, who in his term is charged with national, unimaginable, distortions such as for the defense of the country that “is not a self-determination” or that the 2020 recording in Ebro did not relate to the invasion of migrants but “mass entrance”, reaches the point to raise “questions of national security and possible spy.”
3854	13	In this effort, Syriza’s deputy, who has not hesitated to succeed against a Financial Times article by publicly formulating the unacceptable accusation that the writing of a dictatorship for Greece was made under the influence of drugs, manages to put another political autogol.
3854	15	"Georgios Tsipras quotes Nikos Panayotopoulos' report on ""Swiss cheese"", forgetting that it was the response to Syriza's unprecedented movement to present the order of forces on an Egean island by calling for even information from an officer of the Greek Army."
3854	17	The political push that Syriza’s deputy finds is based on the conclusion that the Ministry of National Defense has not made any relevant announcement about the publication. He concludes with the estimate that “and it seems that verification processes have been initiated,” ignoring the way the Armed Forces operate.
3854	19	The inclusion of this specific timely question in parliamentary control will be a good opportunity for explanations from the opposition officials. Especially for the threats that SYRIZA will explode a national success such as the mutual defense agreement with France, if there is no Greek added value.
3854	21	And in this context, George Tsipras, will be asked to answer if France does not agree, that means that the remaining Rafale fighters will not be received or that the Belharra fregates will remain disguised in the shipyards?
3855	1	What will the right-wing people do? 
3855	3	Yes, it is true that the Lord has not all the ND with him. The so-called popular or Karamanical right never lost him. Even when for a time they did not put obstacles to him or did not make statements that questioned him or directly undermined him (as it begins to happen now), her representatives never hid their opposition in his face. What to do, so structured the great multi-collective parties. They have parts and characters within them.
3855	5	So let us be accurate. And when the Neo-Democratic party leadership belonged to the Karamanal or popular right wing, the central and Mithotak part of the leaders and supporters above and below did the same. The Papandreic and mostly the Significant PASOK lived four years of glory and political hegemony, because the central and Mitsotakic wing of the N.D. did not show a particular warmth in defending their party characters. They easily adopted an attitude that eventually interacted politically with the opponent camp.
3855	7	So what we are starting to see now, i.e. a piece of the ND to catch the myth of the captures and use it as a moral measure to fully identify with Syriza’s strategy, was little as expected. If it wasn’t the scratches, it would be something else. He had arrived the crew of time to spread out their talent, before the elections they would try to scratch Mitosotaki.
3855	9	The problem with the original – right – right is that they are moving in the empty political air. First, because they don’t have a leader, a personality that could replace the one they don’t cheer. Secondly, because they pretend they do not understand the strategic importance of the central voters, who are expelled from the ND by their tactics. Third, they forget the historical lessons of their party past. Whenever the right hand was striking, the center called for her to save her. This happened a few years ago, to repeat later the “do not make us, they cheat us” that we see today.
3855	11	The fourth and most important thing (in today’s circumstances) is that they don’t realize that with a policy that directly undermines and illuminates Syriako, they will get a strategic identification with Syriza. They will follow him in both victory and defeat. Syriza's biggest problem will be that he will be found without a story in the repeated elections, even if Kyriakos will be the first with one vote (which will be with much more). In this case, the inter-party folk right, what narrative will be in the second battle as a follow-up of SYRIZA? Would she say “ sorry for the mistake” or will she suffer the hardship of her choices?
3856	1	Does the President work?
3856	3	The country’s journalist associations have called for the President of the Republic to intervene in the scandal of the observations.
3856	5	If Ms. Sacellaropoulos wanted to give up a real height of her office, she had the opportunity—not to say the obligation.
3856	7	But he reacted as the last responsible bureaucrat: “I’m placed on the principle and clearly within the framework of my constitutional responsibilities and the case is now in front of the judicial authorities.”
3856	9	The “placement” took place on... 21 September, when the president of PASOK Nikos Andrulaqis visited it – for his own case.
3856	11	Two months have passed and the scandal has taken the form of a flood. The president said he had already made his debt.
3856	13	Only if one turns to her statement then it will find that it simply reproduces the government’s positions for “the improvement of the legislation” and the “blowing” of the European Parliament.
3856	15	In conclusion: “The case has taken its way before the authorities and the desire of all of us is to be completed and the research to bring results as soon as possible.” What the government says.
3856	17	Since then there has been new, disturbing information. The view of “competent bodies in this case are the House and its investigative Commission, as well as justice” is behind reality – and has been violated by the government.
3856	19	Is the appeal of the “limits of authority”, in accordance with the “principle of discrimination of powers” to which the head of state applies, not valid when it is drawn up with the government on issues of opposition to the parties?
3856	21	He doesn’t want to hurt us, but he doesn’t work for us yet.
3857	1	Petsas throws them to Tsipras for the fraud: He allowed malware to exist
3857	3	If Kyriakos Mitosotakis has been in the government of the country for almost 3.5 years, Nikos Andrulaqis may have been monitored by the European Parliament without having explained why, may the close partner and grandson of the prime minister, Grigoris Dimitriades have been dismissed because of this story, may the PEGA have come to Greece to investigate the scandal and announce that he has not received answers, may the revelations for the observations have taken the form of a snorkeling, however, the Minister of the Interior, Stelius Petsas, is insisting on the line that is confined in the “fraternity”.
3857	5	In particular, speaking about the scandal of the blasts on Wednesday morning (16/11) at the MEGA, the Deputy Minister of the Interior first said: “First, the daily life of the citizen cannot be covered by anything else, because he faces serious problems, for example when he goes to the pump to put gas or motor oil or when he goes to the supermarket. So, he can’t cover his daily life with any other issue than this.”
3857	7	Tsipras has allowed such software to exist.
3857	9	Regarding the control of the existence or installation of illegal software, Mr. Petzas emphasized that, “from the pillars of the bill is cybersecurity with a specific coordination committee to coordinate the various services involved in it, whether it is the ECP or the relevant digital governance ministry.”
3857	11	“It is important that in the previous framework, before the 2019 elections, a few days ago, the then government, Mr. Tsipras, allowed such software to exist, which today we call malicious software without any legal impact. From 2019, a few days before the election, so far, such tracking software could be marketed. We come and say that it is illegal. And if it is illegal, the one who holds it, how can it be perceived and from there and beyond there are the corresponding penalties. That is why there is this level of cybersecurity.”
3857	13	What he said about the confidentiality
3857	15	On the deletion of privacy on political persons, Mr. Petzas emphasized that, “we have made an extensive discussion on the basis of the scientific contradiction and on the positions of Mr. Venizelo or Mr. Gerapritis, how we can strengthen, on the one hand, the need for the EIP to do its work, but on the other hand, the political staff to have some security cells. Such curtains were added with the draft law in consultation so that there are different levels before we get to the prosecutor who will give permission to delete the confidentiality of the communications. This is the decision of the Chairman of the Board.”
3857	17	To eliminate the confidentiality, Mr. Petsas said that “there must be documented, as is the proposal of the ECHR and the anti-terrorist and only these two services. Only in this circumstance the Chairman of the House will be able to give an order to delete the confidentiality. Then we will go to the Prosecutor who will decide definitively. When we have various public services that do their job does not mean that every time the prime minister can be licensed because the service is on him or a minister. There is a process within the public administration. Now there will be a second prosecutor as it was once and was removed by the Syriza government.”
3857	19	“When it comes to the person of the parliament, the president of the parliament will now be informed, this is provided in the bill. It is a process that is followed in all cases concerning political persons,” the minister added.
3857	21	“As for the political climate, it has to do with a lot of things. We make institutional initiatives to address where there are issues and someone can see shadows or that there is no sufficient institutional contradiction. Now, the three years, from what I perceive according to the four pillars that exist in the bill submitted yesterday, is something that exists in other countries, so it may have been the choice of the three years. Over the course of the three years, Mr. Androulaki has the possibility of informing him. The need to investigate a case should not be undermined if it has been deemed necessary to be investigated by the European Commission. There are stages until we get there. In the public consultation that is until November 22 or in the House of Representatives when the legislation comes, if there is a question with the 3 year, will be discussed. But I realize that this option has been overwhelming because there is a precedent in other European countries,” Petsas said.
3857	23	“When a bill enters into consultation, it enters to trigger a discussion, to see aspects that may have issues of improvement and from there and after the time of the final submission of the bill, the results of this consultation will be reflected,” he added.
3858	1	Mr. Polakis shows the real face of Syriza
3858	3	“At the time Syriza officially issued a statement condemning the attack at the house of Adoni Georgiad, Mr. Tsipras’ alter ego, Mr. Polakis, posted an ironic tweet about the attack,” the press office said in a statement.
3858	5	"Will Syriza dismiss him? ""But it has been shown many times that Mr. Polakis is the speaker of the party 'line' and shows the real face of SYRIZA,"" the statement concludes."

3859	5	A close photo of the 79-year-old U.S. president while he was sitting revealed a document with instructions that stated, “YES you will sit in the center” and “YES you will make the opening comments.”
3859	7	“YES, President Guido and Prime Minister Kissida will post for a photo immediately before the event begins,” he wrote at another point, while there are indications about when he will have to talk. At the bottom of the note, there is a reminder to turn the page to see its introductory statement.

386	1	The fire is still burning in the eyes of the people.
386	3	by Anastasia Cybuguli and Nicoletta Mutuasi 
386	5	Sadness and abandonment weigh the Eye, a year after the fire that destroyed death and destruction. The words hardly can describe the feelings of relatives, friends, residents of the area who were found in the memorial that took place yesterday in the holy Temple of Sleeping of the Theotoku for their people lost in the flames. But the words of the people themselves who managed to get out alive from the nightmare have described exactly what happened that black day on July 23, 2018. The errors and illigories of the state mechanism that had been revealed in the local investigation of the “Filberal” in the area a few days after the tragedy, and even today come to light shocking testimony about what led to the hell of fire residents, landers, passing through the area that was just a few meters from the sea. People who had not been warned by anyone about the fire that arrived in their courts, people who were found stuck in the wrong places by the intervention of the authorities.
386	7	"According to a letter from the Coordinating Committee of Residents in Mata Attika to the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitosotaki, they call for no more valuable time to be lost to the restoration of the problems that still lack the ""oxygene"" from the injured area."
386	9	“The district affected by the catastrophic fire of July 23, 2018 in the East Atlantic, a year later, faces serious problems, which is not the time to list. But we would like to inform you as soon as possible, as we will need your personal and governmental sympathy to overcome the obstacles and to quickly restore life to a normality and not to lose another valuable time,” he said.
386	11	Present and present.
386	13	The memorandum was delivered by the Minister of Civil Protection, Mikhail Khrishohid, the new regionalist Attika, Georgius Patulis, the mayor of Rafina and Marathon and the Eastern Attica member of the New Republic, Georgius Vlask, while the feeling was caused by the absence of the leaders of the previous government. The Minister of Civil Protection, Mikhail Kṛṣṇaïd, said in his statements the Prime Minister's involvement in the sorrow of the victims' relatives and friends, as well as the government's will to express sympathy to the injured and injured. Today is a day of memory for a drama whose wounds are open. On behalf of the Prime Minister, I translate his participation in the sadness of the people who have lost unfairly, in the sadness of the people who have lost their own. We are close to the injured people seeking care, there are a number of issues that are open, from urban to health issues. For one thing I want to assure you, that such an uninterpretable tragedy should and should not happen again, never and ever. We’re going to work to this,” Mr. Kṛṣṇaides said.
386	15	“We are committed that in cooperation with the government, we will ensure that the affected areas are fully restored and that normality is returned to the daily lives of citizens. At the same time, however, our primary priority is to better protect our Attica from natural disasters,” Mr. Patulis said, among other things.
386	17	Shocking was the moment when the priest read the names of the 102 victims of the fire in the battle that took place after the memorial in the Silver Coast. There were sensations of pain, sadness, but also anger from people who are struggling so far to face the tragic losses of their loved ones.
386	19	Memory Events
386	21	The road, honor and memory struggle took place on Sunday with the start and end in the port in Eye.
386	23	Last night, with a celebration in the Hry Cave at the Open Theatre of Odrases, in New Macri, was honored the memory of the actress and writer who found tragic death in the July 23 fire.
386	25	"On July 23th, a memorial evening was held dedicated to the victims of the deadly fire in Mati, New Buja and Rafina, entitled ""A Year After"". The event was scheduled by Leda Primopalti, and the Golden Passenger, the theatre critic, philosopher and translator, Kosta Georgiosopoulos and the region singer and resident, Vangelis Germos. It followed the performance of the theatrical work “A Year After...” by Constantine Rode and Vulas Stabelou, a work – a documentary based on real events and directed by Nanas Nikolau."
386	27	Today, on the day of the deadly fire, in every affected area will be gathered those who want it and walking the fire streets will end silently in the port of Matius, at 8 p.m., where the memorial baptism and the expression of the names of the dead will be held.
386	29	No preparation despite the tragedy.
386	31	"Lack of European funds, which would contribute to the upgrading of the fire protection fleet through the rescEU program, delay in renting the necessary aircraft, even reduction in the operation of the European emergency number ""112"" to warn citizens. This is part of the image that the previous government leaves behind in the field of anti-fire protection. Having on her back the 102 dead from the tragedy in Eye, she did not show the minimal sensitivity to move on to take even the minimum measures to prevent the corresponding phenomena from repeating."
386	33	A few days before the anti-fire period began last May and a few months after the Eye, the Syriza government managed to consult the draft law on the new civil protection plan. However, as all the stakeholders claimed, it was not necessary to be applied during the current period, except that its provisions did not make a substantial change in the way the units operate. In other words, as the then Secretary-General for Civil Protection, Janis Tafilis, acknowledged that the availability of media presented the same image as last year.
386	35	Only 4 to 5 canters are considered functional, while approximately 50% of the fire fleet vehicles are considered available, with the rest being damaged or completely useless. As for staff deficiencies, these are enormous.
386	37	The “112”
386	39	"More impressive of all is, however, that the previous government failed to put the emergency number ""112"" into full operation, which the new government Mitosotaki set as the first goal. The Ministry of Digital Reconstruction has already had contacts with mobile companies and will follow others. The bet is that the number will operate fully by the end of 2019, but an intermediate solution is immediately implemented. In this context, a service to send conventional SMS to all mobile phones located in areas of interest will be activated and the automatic transmission of messages from television and radio stations will also be considered."
3860	1	Syriza in Ukraine
3860	3	Because of Al. Tsipras condemned unclearly and from the first moment the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there is so much doubts about Syriza’s attitude towards Putin?Is it because they did not support the mission of military material to the victims of the war fighting for their life, freedom and homeland?Maybe why a crowd of his leaders have spent a lot of energy to explain the mistakes of the West that, in their analysis, caused the extreme reaction of Moscow? and the US with the manipulation of the countries of the former Soviet Union – the list is long.
3860	5	Certainly the continuous protesters have played a role: Those who bombed Yugoslavia are now crying for war crimes, Iraq’s shaped are swallowing the finger, even Afghanistan is reminded of the Taliban.
3860	7	And, of course, the proportions mean something: in the cracks for the ban of the “Lake of the Rabbits”, but a few words about the arrests and the wood at the anti-war protests in Russia. Fair anger for NATO propaganda and tolerance to Russian agulism. A great interest in the country of the Golden Dawn for Azov's order and for the Nazi in Ukraine, although neither 2% took in the last elections, a distance from Russian fascism as it is experienced by political opponents, homosexuals, anti-resistant artists, intellectuals, journalists.
3860	9	Then they do not fill their eyes and Zelensky. Where and where is the symbolic personality of the Western world the Lazopoulos of Ukraine? and why does he demand the immediate involvement of NATO countries with the closure of the airspace? does he not care whether the Third World War begins? and why does he not synthesize as soon as possible?
3860	11	There are no fake news. The bombings of hospitals and the deaths of children are like the oil cormoron of the Persian Gulf in 1991.
3860	13	The doubt is given, since no controversial commentary parliamentarians, parliamentarians, executives is denied.
3860	15	And if Sakharova has offended our country, it’s not Olbright, Condoleezza or Paul and Blinken to give it a loud response from the whole political world. Here the Americans suddenly loved Maduro for oil, Putin tempted them?
3860	17	The doubling messages are sent by Syriza’s leaders in their public interventions and, more unclearly, their courageous supporters on social media. The doubt is given, since no controversial commentary parliamentarians, parliamentarians, executives is denied.
3860	19	The memories of a past that has never been “normally” rejected are also counted: The Kammen who was vaccinated in Belgrade with Sputnik-V and poses with Russian dust in moments of desire was a Defense Minister – these are forgotten?
3860	21	One interesting question is whether Alexis Tsipras is troubled with all this or somewhere within him enjoys it. If he, like Polakis, thinks that Erdogan puts our glasses with the magnet of neutrality, if he believes in the “two imperialism” of Arvanit, and if he does not masks with the heroization of Zelensky of the “accluded murders” (Cartus). The most likely is that it will not let us learn and that’s why it’s like we know.
3860	23	Mr. Angelica Spanoe is a journalist, writer.
3861	1	Theatre: Changes in the Pentagon
3861	3	A significant change will occur immediately in the Pentagon and will not pass unnoticed. According to information, the director of the minister Nico Panayotopoulos, Athan, will be removed. Valaris, who will move to his political office in Kavala. This is a move imposed from above and as I learn, it has not disappointed any serious person, instinctive or not.
3861	5	The hostage in Mizotaki
3861	7	Experienced leaders from Brussels in recent days said that the Dutch parliamentary Sophie in Feld, the head of PEGA’s investigation in Greece, did something that seems to be putting a trap in Mitsotakis. Specifically, the conclusion he will submit on the scores in our country – a significant detail: it will be his own conclusion and not the final – will be, as it was known, ready in about three months. Practically this means, as the experienced executives that I told you, that the topic of the observations will be revived around March, that is, a breath from the national elections.
3861	9	Reverse
3861	11	While the official opposition “succes” the subject of the assassinations in any way, the first victim of the observations that came to the light of the public, Nikos Androlakis, has dropped the tones. Characteristically, while SYRIZA said that the draft law on the changes in the EIP “legalizes the observations,” the president of PASOK stated (Mega) that the draft law is “satisfactory in too many points”, although he emphasized that he disagrees with the information of the observed after a three years, saying it must be immediate.
3861	13	attention
3861	15	Since I told you earlier that the issue of the ECHR is sensitive and we should not forget that the responsibilities of the Agency are not those for which it is concerned, but above all issues of national security, there should be a calmness. And the passing of three years for...information is the right measure and I explain: A agent in Evros who acts in favor of Turkey must be monitored? The answer is again obvious and is no. And therefore, calmness. It is not possible to dissolve the country’s intelligence agencies, which I repeat that they have very serious tasks to do and not, of course, to monitor political persons.
3862	1	“Young people don’t work, they’re scratching on the mobile”: Alexis Sissovitis teaches the pleasant youth
3862	3	The Greek Celebrity urge to put the unemployed young people on the right way
3862	5	The steps of Costa Francais but with a more impotent life/Vasilaks Kailas/workers background followed Alexis Sissovitis. Invited to ERT’s Studio 4 show, our actor gave a rant of his arms for the young people who are scratching while they can find a job, etc. You know.
3862	7	The warning differences with Francois' rant are that Sysovites has worked more than 2 minutes in his life. We didn’t know, but he told us, as it is usual in these cases:
3862	9	    “The moment that changed my life was at the age of 13 when my father took me to the building. When you get harsh and the rest of the kids are out, in the cafés and have an unpleasant life while you have to hide, there you are breastfeeding and even at a minor age. The next is a staircase. The building for me was a regime, the whole family was there and we worked. Thessaloniki was so poor in the 1980s that you had no choice and you had to be there. They had filled my wings.”
3862	11	The other difference is that it didn’t begin to say about some unknown to everyone benefits that in some magic way fall from heaven and don’t let the world work for the land. Something is that too. On the other hand, it plays so much marketing the idea that if you want it so much you’ll succeed that if you’re not a member of Creation Again you can suffer anaphylaxis.
3862	13	Here is the controversial point, after 17:20. To be prepared for what you will hear, in the interview hears even Paul Coyle:
3862	15	    “I was filled with the wings. We’re talking about unemployment and I who have the “Faust” and I’m looking for people to work, I really don’t find children to work. We live in other times. Internet and technology have changed everything. The world is in an autism, sitting on a mobile, being unhappy, being in a hole, in a bubble and yet not active, not going to work.
3862	17	    They prefer to be 25 percent unemployed, rather than lifting the mansions and working. We know it and at the same time we hear young people say “I don’t have a job.” Work, go out, search, do and show. I see other young children who are worried and that’s what saves them. Einstein said that 90% of success is work, not talent.
3862	19	Well, here we arrived, OK BOOMER.
3863	1	The flag of the Kingdom of Greece gives a well-known democratic newspaper, if you want to put it on your balcony
3863	3	The necessary accessory for every home who wants to live in the sweet 50s
3863	5	You may not know what is missing from the decoration of your home, or even better, your balcony, but the most based conservative newspaper of the country knows it. Where all the other right-wing brochures (the Mecelio is a special exception) have sold them to the question “how to become the most wicked Greek right-wing without calling you a thief” and throw their words against the upcoming Sovietization of the country, the House wins the flag of our king for a gift.
3863	7	Well you heard, on the coming Sunday the House will have a gift the version of the Greek flag that was wearing in the time we had still Stema and Palace. So, you will be able to put it in your living room or hang it on the balcony so that all passengers will hurt with you the once King Constantine.

Let’s say here that this is the first prime tour in Gaudí since the 90s – the last visit was made 26 years before Kosta Siemiti. Let’s say here that Gaudo remembered her last year and Katarina Sakelaropoulos, for the same occasion.
3864	7	If you are interested in his program, the Prime Minister will take the military helicopter from Sudan at 11 a.m., then he will give the present to the show with the cross and sanctification and then he will inspect the local military prison.

3864	9	We had already understood that he is a man with ears open to ideas that challenge the established concepts:
3864	11	In any case, we hope the visit will evolve somewhat like this:
387	1	Putin: ‘Unknown’ sanctions are a bumerang for the West
387	3	He denied the U.S. that they think the rest of the world is their “real” and that they treat other states as “cities.” 
387	4	Russian President Vladimir Putin used a hard language for the Western countries, speaking at the World Economic Forum in St. Petersburg. 
387	6	As the war in Ukraine has exceeded the 110 days, and the United States and its allies have imposed a series of sanctions on Moscow, Putin accused the United States of having reached the point to consider themselves as “the gods” on the planet Earth, who have no duty but interests. He also claimed that the United States believes that the rest of the world is their “real” and that they treat other states as “cities.” 
387	8	After proclaiming the end of “the era of the monopoly world,” he said that “nothing will be as old” on the international political scene. After all, she sent a message to the European Union, saying, “It has completely lost its sovereignty and its elites dance on the basis of someone else’s melody, hurting its population. The real interests of European and European are completely ignored and neglected.”
387	10	“They have damaged their own economies.”
387	11	Continuing in the same spirit, he described the sanctions as “unreasonable” and “absurd” which were intended to “destroy” the Russian economy. He claimed that Russia has already exceeded the sanctions, stressing that the dirty forecasts for the country’s economy were not verified. 
387	13	On the contrary, he noted that the sanctions actually have brought the U.S. and Europe that imposed them into a difficult place. Specifically, he said the European leaders have “tacked a serious blow” on their own economies, pointing out that social and economic issues are deteriorating on the “southern continent”. At the same time, the U.S. has recorded increases in the prices of goods, food and fuel.
387	15	The living level of Europeans is falling and their are losing their competitiveness, the Russian president also stressed, claiming that this will have long-term consequences throughout Europe. He also warned that the systematic economic decline in the European economy will worsen the major problems that exist in Western societies.
387	17	Cooperation with other countries
387	18	After all, he claimed that Russia was “forced” to go on a “special operation” in Ukraine, saying a difficult but necessary decision. He argued that the Russian forces are defending the country’s rights to security and that the military operation is intended to defend the people of Donbas.
387	20	He sent a message to the West that Moscow will “extend” its cooperation with other countries (with all those interested), noting that there are so many countries that want to cooperate with Russia that correspond to a “extraordinary number of people on the planet.” However, he refused to name these states. 
388	1	Movies and Nato realism
388	3	"As an artistic stream, socialist realism is obsolete. But in the strange new-psycho-war era in which we live another realism appears to the international horizon: the Nato realism which manifests not only on the political, military level but also on the ideological and artistic. At least this impression is given by Zelensky’s greeting message at the opening ceremony of this year’s Cannes Festival. We need films like the ""Dictator"" of Charlie Chaplin, said the Ukrainian president – and who can have an opposition? (I hope they will be filmed like the ""Modern Times"" that will talk about the unknown labor war of our time.)"
388	5	For the first time in recent history, representatives of the hard-nuclear military establishment are getting an open place for Ukraine's first in Eurovision, as NATO's Deputy Secretary-General did. Where we talked about the military/industrial complex we now see the military/artistic complex emerging. Politics always used art, but never the gathering of power and view was so unclear.
388	7	Half a century ago, the tone at the Festival of Cannes (annulled) was given by the unreliable children of the French May and the Gondar. This year the tone is given by Zelensky’s rough military shirt and his title “Glory to Ukraine”. It is not given to him anti-war masterpieces such as the “Great Chimera” of Renouard or the “Stators on the Front” of Kubrick where the papal heretic phrase “Patriotism is the last refuge of the purifies” is heard.
388	9	Putin is disappointed, but the new Hitler is not (as Zelensky is not the new Churchill). Dramatic moments lived (hour now) and Mariupol is living, but the new Mesologue is not – unless a new Solomon or a new Lord Vernon wants to see it like that. The sweeping smell of the NATO, the smell of the expansion of the war deliver the words and works of Zelensky, the words and works of Mitsotakis and other precepts.
389	1	The Mitosotaki government insists on lies and blasphemy against “journalist silence” over the Novartis scandal
389	3	"In a parallel universe of disturbance of events and fake news he insisted on trying to undermine the reality the government spokesman regarding the judgment of the Court on the Novartis case, speaking at the same time about an unjustice circle despite the collapse of the accusation of scam, and insisting on the false reports of his statements last Friday, which he even described as ""not accurate"". The panic of the Great Maximus appeared also from the answers of Janny Hikonom to the questions of documentonews.gr about the case."
389	5	In the previous years decisions of archiving the cases of nine of the ten involved political persons during the investigation of the Novartis scandal, the government spokesman ordered to defend the Mitosotaki government narrative, carrying out another misconduct. Speaking of the “definitive exemption” of those political persons, although in fact their cases were archived, the Council of Justice of the Special Court ruled that they were “clearly investigated” by the Justice, and of course, the theory of “forgiveness” against them was dissolved after the accusation fell.
389	7	Janis Oikonomu appeared in the information of the political writers with his main topic the case of the reference of the former Deputy Minister of Justice, Dimitri Papagallopoulos “for the operation of an unjustice circle, for abuse of power, for brutal interventions in Justice for a number of cases, including Novartis.” In fact, he reached the point of... half apology for his false reports last Friday, acknowledging that “my first statement, in the exclusively formal part of the charter for the 10 political persons in the Novartis case, was not accurate,” citing, however, that “this does not remove the political issue, but also the substantial.”
389	9	"In any case, despite the vocabulary he selected in his 36-minute appearance was completely absent from the line of the ""conflict"", he continued to compose the government narrative on which the rise and governance of the Mitosotaki government was based, as well as the recital of the liquidity of the intervention in Justice that the Prime Minister had carried out from the stage of the House, accusing among other things journalists of being ""subconscious and gang""."
389	11	“Will the Prime Minister apologize for the disruption of the assumption of the innocence of the journalists he described as a underworld and gang?” asked the government spokesman, with G. Oikonomus insisting that “the things that the Prime Minister had said were true and some of them are confirmed by the reports in the case of Rykus on the case of Novartis.” The above reference arises not only underground but also false, since the only reference to the bullying to journalists is in the pressures that are alleged to have been exercised through the Parapolitics, and by no one of the Kosta Bakhsevani, Janna Papadaku, Janni Filippaki and Aleksandr Tarka who were dismissed by Kyriako Mitosotaki.
389	13	“Because all these years the political narrative of the government is based on the theory of the torture against the ten political persons, do you accept the decision of the Justice? how here the government officially talked about covert witnesses while on the basis of their deposits Novartis paid to the United States?” G. Oikonomus, like the devil, avoided the libanese to report to the protected witnesses, for whom the legislation of their additional protection is still outstanding, only as long as he declared the respect of the government to the Justice, moving forward to a false-type description of the case.
389	15	“It is the same justice that has decided to appeal those who are referred to in the matters that the justice considered to be referred, and this is absolutely respected,” Mr. Economus said, after just before he had gently stated that “the government always respects the decisions of the Justice.” But then, the government spokesman has rushed to resume the issue of two and a half years ago’s archives of nine of the ten politicians involved in the investigation of Novartis’ financial scandal, even leaving the opposition official because “I’ve not heard anything from anyone so far.”
389	17	In a new question about Yannis Sturnarah and the fact that the complaints of the protected witness Nikou Manyadaki to Kosta Vakshvany for his rap by the central bankier placed by documentonews.gr, Yikonomu made another falsification of reality. Although the Justice considered these complaints reliable, on the question of whether there is a matter for the government with the central bankier, it went to the absolute coverage, unlike Andrei Loverdo, whom it left unclean.
389	19	“Mr. Sturnaras is among the political persons for whom the Justice has decided definitively and irreversibly that he had no involvement,” he said again, even though it is an archiving, continuing that “in spite of the fact that he was one of the people who was targeted very hard with the toolbox known by the SYRIZA system in the previous period” and adding that “the Greek justice has found that he has no least involvement in this case.”
