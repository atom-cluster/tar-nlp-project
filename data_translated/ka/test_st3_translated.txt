391	1	He said, “The king is the king, and the king is the king.”
391	3	"Propaganda has created a public mind. He said, “They are the greatest people in the world, the greatest people in the world, the greatest people in the world.” The central propaganda car of the east, through local telecommunications and non-governmental organizations, tells the peoples that the two nations of Europe and the U.S. are a revolution, while Russia and the western world, among them, peoples - birds, who should be ""democratic"". In the western prophetic train, they are their mothers, who have long stopped supplementing and passed away."
391	5	After and to the present day, the Russian and Russian political, democratic and public interests, non-profit and/or sales, have not been opposed to the Eastern Prosecutor's Office (see a number of media, who have challenged possibilities because of the lack of support for rights). As a result, the public opinion has been revealed that the birds who go out of the water and don’t go out of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.
391	7	What is a public opinion created? It’s a dispersed bubble that strangles everybody to whom they are attracted – most often the idealists and the creators of truth. These are collective letters, with a request for the diversity of the people's minds and the call from the communities of their children. This is the Nazi Representative of the Central Committee of the Russian Federation, who are ready to send a message to everyone who is friends with Russia!
391	9	But, despite the unprecedented financial possibilities and the value of support for Western countries, despite the fact that the increased number of people's friendship in relation to cities is remembered, and the great warfare is only a few hundred years old, the eastern crisis is seen in the southern part of the country. In addition to those who promote this propaganda and a few parties from the Christian opposition, who stand on the U.S. state defence, the people of the U.S. are not poor Russians to be expelled, the people of the U.S. love the Russians and the people of the U.S. want to build friendship with Russia. It doesn’t need a police to say: “Why didn’t we do it in 2008, just as now I don’t know the country, whom only a weapon was killed, so that as many Russians can kill the air in the sea! Natasha, the United States and the European Union do not declare any sanctions for the Russian Federation for alphabet and animal, as it is said for alphabet and alphabet! We do not want to do it, but we do not want to do it, we do not want to do it, we do not want to do it, we do not want to do it, we do not want to do it. And, despite this numerous life, today I have been looking forward to bringing the Russians to the alphabet and the wild and remembering the “Second Orthodox Fertilizer” to help the Brazilian!
391	11	According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Lithuania, the government of the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Lithuania are not responsible for the implementation of the Treaty on Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Treaty on Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania. America and Europe are all in their own food, so I can’t even imagine that the people of the world, the Prime Minister of Justice and the people of the world’s “righteous peoples” have committed a “righteous peoples in the world’s market” transition, and that they are not in the hands of legal beliefs, anti-conflict and peaceful communications! The people who are familiar with the world’s “Friends of the World” western collections and they went closer, they saw the people’s love, what is important to the fish! The long-lasting “humanist movement” and its hosts are the persons of death, and as the grants will not stop, the “humanist actor” which is more likely to be inflicted with the lobby, will be taken from the telecrons.
391	13	The story is dead! - Writing a continuous question of the agency at the University of Philadelphia, - during the Second World War, the whole Europe was in the middle of the Hewlett and together they tried to get Russia out of the ground and to get out of the ground! Our student then defeated philosophy and humankind and remembered mankind! In the meantime, it’s a good thing to do, but it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do. Today is the day of fighting against the people and the philosophy!
391	15	I answer the words of the question: When during the Second World War the whole Europe was in the support of Hewlett (and he wanted to be the “second pharaoh” before the final victory was already overcome!), means that “the peaceful Europe was against all the peoples of the Russians, the peoples and the SSR. Thro Europe, Heidelberg was fought with a weapon and a living force that fought against the Red Army, including 700 000 battles from Vietnam. And today the whole Europe is against the Russians and also against the peoples who have said anything about the struggle against the Russians, why do you have to defend - the way of state revolutions to shed the freedom and return the judge to the freedom!
391	17	"The history of the “realist state” which the United States has created will be reversed with weapons and money until it has commemorated the Americans. The same enthusiasm for ""the state of the kingdom"" - the Battalion and the Mexican leaders, who ask for the new party of the weapons, have already gotten up with the penalty and the benefit of them is significantly less than the money. They don’t want to make it so much that the European economy can be overwhelmed by a serious problem! And when the east is calling for more terrorists, as ISIS says, the east will begin in the hours... the repression of the country will never become a state, just as ISIS has not become a state, because the state can’t just fight, and the terrorists know nothing else."

3914	3	“Our year’s responsibility, I speak to the whole community, but to the political parties in the first round, I can speak to myself and to my side, is the acceptance of the concepts where it will be possible to differentiate political forces with the end and action, despite the fact that they don’t like each other.
3914	5	But today we have the freedom, which is similar to the messaging stations, Europe and the United States. I think it’s a good thing to do, but I think it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do, it’s a good thing to do.
3914	7	According to him, until this context does not change, until there is a progressive, progressive freedom that love and love do not interfere with each other, before it simply won’t happen or simply will be its message, including the message of our partners in Brussels.
3914	9	“From the refined world, what is in these messages is evil. Other people say that there are a lot of people in the world who have a lot of people in the world. This is all possible, if the government and the opposition have a common view on some strategic issue and we, the European Union and its county, who are seriously driving the international propaganda that Europe and the United States have been able to enter the war and use the speeches of the country and they have emerged seriously before all this, we will never be able to deal with it.
3914	11	We don’t have a general strategic initiative if we have a general strategic initiative to someone who doesn’t have to be this, of course, should work with him. Those who don’t guide and need a disk, with them need work, who in all things guide it is in your heart, but there are no links.
3914	13	If someone needs to do the parties, at his time our past partners have been in touch with Putin, you have had a lot of claims that both parties will be committed to the conflict – Vietnam and Russia, almost we will be committed to the conflict, to the conflict, to the conflict, to the conflict, to the conflict, to the conflict.
3914	15	This should be remembered, as the demands of non-culturalization from our partners, what situation should be set up in the country, but in order to make sure we are set up, our responsibility is to change all of this, not to be a progressive, proactive freedom.

3915	1	Khadijah: In the Christian opposition there is an unbeatable people, their own country and the people
3915	3	These are immortal people, nor the state, nor the state, nor the state, nor the country, nor the people. From this point of view, they are primarily interested in the fact that neither the Europe will go before, nor the country – about this “righteous affairs” leader Ibrahim Khademaran said on the question of the journalist – how accurate it is from the opposition side to say that nothing will be good when the process begins, on the subject of the state issue and the discretion of this process from any side will eventually come to the future of the state.
3915	5	As he says, this can be a good idea for the community. The fact is that they do not serve their own country and in the case, they are in the service that is in accordance with the state’s interests.
3915	7	“They are unreliable peoples, not the state and the state, the state, their country and the people. From here, they are primarily interested in the fact that neither the European Union went before nor the country went before. As far as this does, the public can be aware of it and we can talk more honestly, but the same feature is that they do not serve their country and, in the case, do not serve the service that affects the state interests and our public interests. The main contributor is the Oracle community, the community sees this, does it, and the result is that in all elections we have the support of 48 times 47% of the service,” – said Iracle Khadem.
3916	1	In the opposition: “The question of the names on the head of the body” he looks out and asks for something that makes the polarisation clear.
3916	3	People in the first chapter say that the main initiative should be depolation and “the question of the name on the face of the body” seems, they appear and initially ask for the same thing that implies the pluralism – fair choices, actions, etc. – About this “righteous assets” leader Iracle Khadem said, who was the leader of the “scientific commitment” to make a statement of the principle of self-righteousness, which is the leader of the choice and the demand.
3916	5	According to him, Nika Melani made his own popularity rejection by the party by a Christian masterpiece, but he never believed in his request.
3916	7	“We take our responsibility. We create workplaces and bring everyone to work. If they don’t agree with what I’m going to do, I’m not able to make a deposit to be put down, I’m not able to get someone to join. It is democratic. People don’t want to be Europeans. “Inspiracy,” as the President of the Republic does not necessarily fulfil the 12 points, is democratic and can have their own political choice, but our desire is to Europe, to take the status of government and they are afraid that we will take the status of government if they are promoting and so on. Fear, you have your own choice, democracy is part of it all.
3916	9	What do we hear about the right choices – people first say that the main task should be depolarization and the question of the names appears on the face of the brain, they appear and first ask the same thing that depolarizes – the right choices, actions, etc. This is their choice, they don’t want any deposit, nor 12 points performance because they’re afraid of 12 points performance. You think that if you get the status of the law in this case we will write the rows and properly they will be removed. They stayed in this village and stayed in their place, democracy and their choice.
3916	11	The elections will be in 2024. They do not believe in their own demands. It came out in the dark, there were a lot of problems, which in the “photo” seemed very complicated and something of a Christian mindfulness was made to dissolve the party’s foundation of his own popularities, but his own request that he didn’t believe it was clearly gone. What is their main problem? This is the support of the communities have not had, if the people don’t eat them support and in such conditions, of course, will not be successful the uncertainty of the request that they use with regard to the choice, the actions will not be successful. In the last elections we saw 47%, which is a striking result in democracy, when the Democratic Party takes 47% over the eight years, it is really the result that takes a lot of things, including how substantially the majority of communities are committed to the political force that has been the “national movement” that has led the country to the loss of territories, departure and hundreds of disadvantages,” – said Iracula Khadem.

3917	7	“I think nothing will hurt us and you won’t hurt us, with a view to being able, I can say that the main goal is the capacity of our survival and that’s the outcome of what’s happening now,” Putin said.
3917	9	As the Russian Federation said, in view of the world operations, the Russian Federation does not stop anything, it only tries to finish.
3918	1	You're Boogie: The real choices are not a metal initiation, it's an extra air output
3918	3	“I’m very happy that I’ve got it very well. If I again forget to talk about the right choices, this will be my intuition?! “There will be good choices” – now you’re looking forward to and asking what you’re going to say about the boxer’s initiative? – No, oh and rightly also I want to say, this is not a non-governmental initiative, it’s an extensive air output.” – So remembered “Cyprus of the Russian Federation”, you’re going to be a member of the European Parliament in connection with the election.
3918	5	“This posture exists for a long time and Europe’s this posture we have from ourselves, when the idiot had a place that they could at 12 pounds if they couldn’t advocate and until the end of the year to complete the revision that we had to remember the country? We then realized that the initiative could be a real choice, that nothing could be prompted, that something could be set up, because until there is a public peaceful protestant in the way that it is forced to make a reform, I can’t get it.
3918	7	That’s why we have an intention that the communities will be such a mobility that the choices, when it should not be taken, or in the 2024 or in the 2024, which is very desirable, in this section of the measures, of course, to satisfy the past principles of the Constitution.
3918	9	It’s difficult and for this it takes a lot more commitment to this process, while for a good choice it is necessary that these commitments be prepared for a striking, striking protest in the next year and this is necessary for the political process the return of the truth of the commitments, while the return of this truth is necessary from those players, including the most typical player from the real commitment, to determine how badly they came when they got this war many times different from us.
3919	1	“This is our goal and we will accomplish. In the end, this will bring about the strength of our country.”
3919	3	The Kremlin leader, Vladimir Putin, said that the Russian Federation has not stopped anything with the “special environmental operation” and only tries to complete it. He said that he was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one.
3919	5	“We don’t forget anything with the “external operations” but we’re just trying to finish it. The military operations began in 2014 after the “government rebellious.” “The “intermediate surgery” is aimed at the release of those people who have been under the leg for eight years,” Putin said.
3919	7	According to him, the Russian government made an unprecedented decision after which the issue could not be resolved peacefully.
3919	9	“All our women are committed to helping the people living in the suburbs. This is our goal and we will accomplish it. In the end, this will result in the strengthening of our country,” Putin said.
392	1	The people are fighting against the people and not against the people!
392	3	“Batono no, how do you think of the high sea that the cities that have already been erected by the Russian army have seen as a result of the military rebellion by the armed forces of the Balkans? Where does such forces come to the end of the conflict after the Middle Ages? Why do you want to fight any more in the country, if he is so strong, and does not get rid of it? Does it not be possible to remove the bacteria from the oxygen from the oxygen, so that they are not able to get rid of them? - I am asking the people of the province and I can’t answer, because it has as effective, as well as serious reasons.
392	5	I forget to tell you about the problem and the problem of the people. The strength of the Russian armed forces of “Right Lions” and “Shows” is similar not in foreign forms, but in the state-of-the-art cities, which have received a worldwide academic education in the name of the people and in the teachings. And what was there in the name of the freerolls even after the Great Peace War? It’s true, it’s true! Therefore, experienced militants who have an immense amount of foods and foods shipped from the time of Sri Lanka and more than twice the number of people travelled by the east, can really take a great deal of use of cities and facilities. Usually, every day of the war believes that Lebanon was seriously preparing for war with Russia in the last years, because despite the massive damage of technology and weapons, the armed forces of the Republic of Bulgaria continue the battle.
392	7	"But when it comes to the name operations, the attack, the military and other forces of the armed forces, the tactics of their actions, which had dramatic changes after the attack, here the name of the ""green"" of the Brazilian is not healthier and the instruments and the intended version of the forces, in most of the time, here the perception cannot be changed. This is why, for example, the fight against the fluid after the preparation of the fluid was cut down and not prolonged. But the eastern Balkans armed forces are pushing money and weapons not for defence and defence, but for fighting and defence, while the human injuries of the Balkans for Egypt are not addressed - for the westers this is the most dangerous anti-terrorist one in the world, in which the Russian government needs to be pushed, so that the United States in the world can act more freely (unilaterally) against China."
392	9	Now - for physical reasons. The issue is that the Russians have not been disappointed until the end. For Russia, it is strong to say that the nearest man who has not chosen himself, today is the number one magic for him. It is necessary to understand the idea that the people who have been recalled in the 70 years of the existence of the SSR after the Russian Federation and the Russians whose time and time was the first after the time and time of the fight against the people on all platforms, images and directions, today should be recalled. People with whom we were fighting in the Great Peace War! Remember Duke's words on his wife's struggle that he doesn't have the water of sacrifices and just wants to win? This is the true Russian rule that is in the country, and not the fighting, the liberation of the fighters from the gangster police, the terrorist forces who have claimed the death of our mothers! Whoever worshipped the gods of the liberators, despite the fact that this god was the gods of the last heroes. The heroic cities of Dei, Keita, Scatopoli - this is our general history, to this day the people of the western coast of Crimea are fighting during the protection of the western coast... while the latter neonists are fighting the Russians, destroying the Russians and thus differentiating them from the Russians. With the Russian Federation, their magic is all those who support the Russian army in fighting - chickens, soldiers, ballerins and many others, not the former shrk of almost every river. That’s why you want to have a cappuccino of an atomic atomic and a lot of unbelievable people to get rid of it!
392	11	And when the Russians really disappoint, when they realize that the Muslims will not drop the Serbian fascists, they will act hardly to destroy them and do those who will then put the Russian soldier on the way, it will be a Muslim, American or European!
